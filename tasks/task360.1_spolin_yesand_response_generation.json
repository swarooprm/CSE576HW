    "Definition": "#Given the sentence, #generate \"yes, and\" #response. \"#Yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a #participant in a #dialogue should accept what another #participant has stated (\"#Yes\") and then expand on that #line of thought or #context (\"and...\"). 1 In short, a \"#Yes, and\" is a #dialogue ##exchange in which a #speaker responds by #adding new information on top of the #information/setting that was constructed by another #speaker. Note that a \"#Yes, and\" does not require someone explicitly ##saying 'yes, and...' as part of a #dialogue ##exchange, although it could be the #case if it #agrees with the #description above. There are many ways in which a #response could implicitly/explicitly #agree to the #prompt without specifically ##saying 'yes, and...'.",
