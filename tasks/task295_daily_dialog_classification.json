Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words .      You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way .      Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment .      Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again .

Oh , I see . But a proverb says \" Money makes the mare go . \" I think it will be better if you have more money .      Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing .      Thank you for your caring . I will .      No thanks . ",

I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ?      I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street .      Alright .

Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees .      But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant .      That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do .

You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .      The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .      They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's \" chi \" .      But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?      The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .      Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .      This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .      Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .      This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .      Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . ",

No , I thought that would be included in the rent .      It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities .      I don't think I can afford that .      Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children .      That ’ s a good idea .

That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time !      it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off .      ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter .      I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June .      that's thoughtful of you .      and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us .      that's right ! I almost forgot about that .      what would you do without me ?      we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! ",

What are they ?      One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families .      Why ?      The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .      That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .      And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat .      What's that ?      Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !      Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .      Yeah , I guess so .      You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .      Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds .      So what happened ?      Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .      You should have kept trying . ",

People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .      Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .      How do you think they could be ended ?      I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .      So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .      It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .      Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .

It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .      Is it in a good location ?

If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle .

You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines .      I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .      That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ?      I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity .      You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful .

Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?      Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .      I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .      People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .      I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .      That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .      Thank goodness we're not rich and famous !      Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . ",

I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?      Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .      My pleasure .      I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?      A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .      You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .      Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .      Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?      Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you .      8 pm , that's fine with me .      Okay .      So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .      Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night .      Ok , George . Bye !      Bye , Ann ! ",

Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students .      I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .      Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .      Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?      Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ?      History .      Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your      Thirty percent ?      Yes .      Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?      Yes . It's an excellent system .      Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?      Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .      I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .      I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .      What ? Are you serious ?      Yes .      But nobody uses Macintosh !      That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma      Yes , I'm from Taiwan .      Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .      But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .      There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple .      Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .      No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .      Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .      You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . ",

The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation .      Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time .

I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs .      One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ?      Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago .      But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans .      I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know .      I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there .

I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ?      It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .      Why does he want to do that ?      Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .      Won ’ t they get his inheritance ?      No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .      I see . This sounds interesting !

I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology .      Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?      Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service .      Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle .      Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction .      Interesting ...      Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . ",

Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing .

Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong .      Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' .

Well , it was not like a normal English League match .      No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .      Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye .      Which team do you back then ?      I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .      But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . ",

Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .      Me ! Me !      Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing .

After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ?      Not exactly , but I see your point .      I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean .

        "input": "Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?      I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?      I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .      Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .      Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .      But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?      Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .      I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?      That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .      Really ?      Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .      Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?      Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .      How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?      That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .      So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?      Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .      Why did they want to found a college ?      Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .      Oh , I see .      Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .      When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?      In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .      It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .      Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .      Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .      Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .      I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .      Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .      That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .      You can ask me any question at any time . ",

I wish we Americans had a better train system .      I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much .      I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .      It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars .      Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people .      Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change .      Why do you say \" have to \" ?      Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .      Maybe you're right .

You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .      We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .      That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .      I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .

It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .      Www , man !      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area .      Really ? In New Berlin ?      No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado .      I understand . They think a tornado might come .      Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch .      And the second stage is called a tornado warning .      Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere .      It's scary .      Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .      What do you mean a loud train ?      That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud .      But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?      Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast .      Have you seen a lot of them ?      I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .      Did it hit their house ?      No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them .      What were they doing when you called ?      They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed .      That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ?      Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . ",

This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement .      Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ?      I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama .

Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first .      What should I do then ?      I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour .      I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?      Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road .

I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .      I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power .      you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .      that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .      that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . ",

Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says .      Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?      There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !      Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?      Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? ",

I was at home with my parents in New York City .      really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ?      I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .      that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?      no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos .      did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ?      yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .      did he survive ?      unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower .      I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .      it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .      terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . ",
