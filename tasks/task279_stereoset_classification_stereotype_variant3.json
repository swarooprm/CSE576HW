    "Definition": "In this task, you're given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated.

The passage is unrelated if it doesn't convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. You're expected to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated.",
