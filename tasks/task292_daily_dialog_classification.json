        "input": "Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?   Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .   Yeah , that's very important .   So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .   I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .   That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .   It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .   It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .   But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .   I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .   It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .   You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .   I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .   You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .   It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .   It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ",

Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .   That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .   That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .   I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?   Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?   All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .

Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night .   It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?   Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .   What about the performance itself ?   Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .   Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .   It surely is . And the cast is really the best .   Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?   The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . ",

Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .   Do you do the same exercises every day ?   No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .   Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?   It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .   Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . ",

Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .   Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?   Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .   Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production   That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !   Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...   Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .   Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?   I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .   Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ?   It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .   Ah , get back to you .   Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? ",

Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .

I mean , I receive my bills , not you .   We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account .

You're one of the most experienced managers here !   well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .   well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?   the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .   it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .   I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .   I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?   of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally .   thanks . I appreciate that . ",

Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .   I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .   I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .   Well , it's all new stock in the window now .   May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?   Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .   Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .   Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .   Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .   That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .   There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you .

He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .   How many people are on the board of directors ?   Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . ",

I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .   You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .   So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .   Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .   Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?   Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .   How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?   Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . ",
