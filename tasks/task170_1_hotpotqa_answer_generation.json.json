Chemically, it is a corticosteroid esterified with valeric acid.  It is commonly used topically in dermatology.  The brand name is Nerisone; its creams come in potencies of 0.1% and 0.3%.Context_4: Heptanoic acid Heptanoic acid, also called enanthic acid, is an organic compound composed of a seven-carbon chain terminating in a carboxylic acid.  It is an oily liquid with an unpleasant, rancid odor.  It contributes to the odor of some rancid oils.  It is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and ether.Context_5: Magnesium chloride Magnesium chloride is the name for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl and its various hydrates MgCl(HO).  These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water.  The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water.  In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine.  It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley.  Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe.  Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater.  Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale.  Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.Context_6: Ethanol Ethanol, also called alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and drinking alcohol, is a compound and simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H5OH .  Its formula can be written also as CH3 \u2212CH2 \u2212OH or C2H5 \u2212OH (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH.

It is slightly soluble in water, and soluble in many organic solvents.Context_9: Gold(III) chloride Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine.  With the molecular formula AuCl, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl.  The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds.  There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl).  Chloroauric acid, HAuCl, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as \"gold chloride\" or \"acid gold trichloride\".  Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol.  It decomposes above 160\u00a0\u00b0C or in light.Context_10: Chloride The chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl.  It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents.  Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water.  It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells.  Less frequently, the word \"chloride\" may also form part of the \"common\" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded.  For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent C\u2212Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.Fact_1: Cadmium chlorideFact_2: EthanolQuestion: Cadmium Chloride is slightly soluble in this chemical, it is also called what?",

The earliest documented prosecution of gender-based/targeted crimes is from 1474 when Sir Peter von Hagenbach was convicted for rapes committed by his troops.  However, the trial was unsuccessful in indicting Sir von Hagenbach with the charge of rape because the war in which the rapes occurred was \"undeclared\" and thus the rapes were only considered illegal.  Gender-targeted crimes continued to be prosecuted, but it was not until after World War II when an international criminal tribunal- the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo Tribunal)- were officers charged for being responsible of the gender-targeted crimes (particularly rape) and other crimes against humanity.  Despite the various rape charges, the Charter of the Tokyo Tribunal did not make references to rape, and rape was considered as subordinate to other war crimes.  This is also the situation for other tribunals that followed, but with the establishments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), there was more attention to the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes with each of the statutes explicitly referring to rape and other forms of gender-targeted violence.Fact_1: Global Fighting ChampionshipFact_2: Global Fighting ChampionshipFact_3: Badr HariFact_4: Badr HariQuestion: Who was once considered the best kick boxer in the world, however he has been involved in a number of controversies relating to his \"unsportsmanlike conducts\" in the sport and crimes of violence outside of the ring.",

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.

Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.Context_8: Chang Mi-hee Chang Mi-hee (born December 8, 1958) is a South Korean actress active since 1976.

        "input":"Context_1: Hacker-Pschorr Brewery Hacker-Pschorr is a brewery in Munich, formed in 1972 out of the merger of two breweries, Hacker and Pschorr.  Hacker was founded in 1417, 99 years before the enactment of the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516.Context_2: Reinheitsgebot The Reinheitsgebot (] , literally \"purity order\"), sometimes called the \"German Beer Purity Law\" in English, is the collective name for a series of regulations limiting the ingredients in beer in Germany and the states of the former Holy Roman Empire.  The best-known version of the law was adopted in Bavaria in 1516, but similar regulations predate the Bavarian order, and modern regulations also significantly differ from the 1516 Bavarian version.Context_3: KAGG (law) Gesetz \u00fcber Kapitalanlagegesellschaften (KAGG) \u2014 (German for Investment Company Act) \u2014 was a set of German regulations for Mutual Funds that was phased out in 2007 and replaced by the German Investment Modernization Act (\"Investement Act\").  An objective of the new Investment Act is to promote Germany as an investment fund market, stemming the erstwhile exodus of German-managed funds that became domiciled in other European havens, namely Luxembourg.  BaFin is the regulatory enforcement agency that oversees the German financial industry.Context_4: Building regulations approval To comply with the Building Act 1984 and the subsequent statutory instruments known as the Building Regulations, Building regulations approval is required to construct certain structures in England and Wales.  Construction projects falling into this category are sometimes referred to as \"notifiable\", however this is different from the \"notification\" (which may also be required under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, which seeks to monitor health and safety in construction projects.Context_5: Self-executing order A self-executing order is a type of court order.  Court orders are usually made with only immediate effect, and without any future effect.  With a self-executing order, an order is made by a court that a party to a legal matter must comply with a request by a future date or be subject to legal sanctions.  If the party does not comply with the request, the sanctions will apply with no further court order required.Context_6: Comply or explain Comply or explain is a regulatory approach used in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision.  Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, in Germany, under the Aktiengesetz) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not.  The UK Corporate Governance Code, the German Corporate Governance Code (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' () use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their audit committees, remuneration committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.Context_7: Mercedes-Benz short bonnet trucks The Mercedes-Benz \"Kurzhauber\" (short-bonnet) truck is a conventional layout, cab-after-engine truck manufactured from 1959 to 1995.  In Germany it is most commonly referred to as the \"Kurzhauber\" (for \"short bonnet\").  The engine intruded into the cabin underneath the windshield, all in the name of making a shorter truck to meet the strict period German regulations on overall length.Context_8: Title 47 CFR Part 15 Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15 (47 CFR 15) is an oft-quoted part of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations regarding unlicensed transmissions.  It is a part of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and regulates everything from spurious emissions to unlicensed low-power broadcasting.  Nearly every electronics device sold inside the United States radiates unintentional emissions, and must be reviewed to comply with Part 15 before it can be advertised or sold in the US market.Context_9: Corporate social responsibility Corporate social responsibility (CSR, also called corporate conscience, corporate citizenship or responsible business) is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model.  CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and national or international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in \"actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law\".  The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance.  In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers.  There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak in the sense that they are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance.  'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law.  The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions.  CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.Context_10: Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin limit The Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin limit (GZK limit) is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic rays (high energy charged particles from space) coming from \"distant\" sources.  The limit is , or about 8\u00a0joules.  The limit is set by slowing-interactions of cosmic ray protons with the microwave background radiation over long distances (~160 million light-years).  The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected.  For example, one extreme-energy cosmic ray has been detected which appeared to possess a record (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 60\u00a0mph baseball).Fact_1: Hacker-Pschorr BreweryFact_2: ReinheitsgebotFact_3: ReinheitsgebotQuestion: What does the Hacker-Pschorr Brewery have to limit in order to comply with German regulations?",

For example, G major and G minor have different modes but both have the same tonic, G; so we say that G minor is the parallel minor of G major.

It featured the original Delia Derbyshire arrangement of Ron Grainer's theme tune and music by Malcolm Clarke from the 1972 serial \"The Sea Devils\", which was only the second to have an incidental score provided completely by the Radiophonic Workshop.  Most of the music included came from serials from the previous three years to demonstrate the recent composers' works.  For the album, each serial's incidental music was reassembled into short \"suites\" and although most of the music had been recorded in mono it was, for this compilation, remixed into stereo with sound effects added on to some tracks.  The album was re-released in 1992 by Silva Screen records as \"Earthshock - Classic Music From The BBC Radiophonic Workshop Volume 1\", with bonus tracks including \"The World of Doctor Who\", a track recorded by Mills as a B-side to Dudley Simpson's 1973 \"\"Moonbase 3\"\" single, which featured a mix of music from the serial \"The Mind of Evil\" with sound effects from \"Planet of the Daleks\" before finishing with Simpson's \"Master's Theme\".  Selections from both this compilation and its follow-up, \"Doctor Who - The Music II\", were also re-used on the 1994 Silva Screen compilation \"The Best Of Doctor Who Volume 1 - The Five Doctors\".Context_3: Alf Clausen Alf Heiberg Clausen (born March 28, 1941) is an American film and television composer.

It is formed from a dedicated set of claret liveried sleeper, dining and lounge carriages.  The current stock dates from 1977-1987.  They are arranged according to requirements, and stored when not in use.  The earliest royal coaches date back to the mid-19th Century in the reign of Queen Victoria; until an upgrade in 1977 there were multiple sets based in different regions, a legacy of the pre-nationalisation era of railways in Britain.  Many are now in museums or on heritage railways; the National Railway Museum in York has a royal themed exhibition.  Dedicated locomotives have never traditionally been part of the Royal Train, first appearing in special livery only in the 1990s, but also seeing use on other trains since 2003.  In the 21st Century, various preserved (and one new build) steam locomotives have also hauled the train on special occasions.  Although regularly cited by critics as one of the unnecessary luxuries of the Royal Family, which has led to an increase in the alternate use of normal scheduled services where possible, supporters argue the current arrangement emphasizes utility over luxury, and is still often the most practical and secure mode of travel to fit the required itinerary and avoid disruption to the public.Context_9: The Simpsons Theme \"The Simpsons\" Theme\", also referred to as \"The Simpsons\" Main Title Theme\" in album releases, is the theme music of the animated television series \"The Simpsons\".

The piece, which took 3 days, 2 hours, 48 minutes, and 19 seconds to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.  The theme, as used for the opening sequence, was re-arranged during season 2, and the current arrangement by Alf Clausen was introduced at the beginning of the third season.Context_10: Las Lomitas Elementary School District The Las Lomitas Elementary School District is a public school district in the San Francisco Bay Area, primarily serving parts of the communities of Menlo Park, Atherton and Ladera, with its headquarters in Menlo Park.

        "input":"Context_1: Fortean Times Fortean Times is a British monthly magazine devoted to the anomalous phenomena popularised by Charles Fort.  Previously published by John Brown Publishing (from 1991 to 2001) and then I Feel Good Publishing (2001 to 2005), it is now published by Dennis Publishing Ltd.Context_2: Charles Fort Charles Hoy Fort (August 6, 1874 \u2013 May 3, 1932) was an American writer and researcher who specialized in anomalous phenomena.  The terms \"Fortean\" and \"Forteana\" are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena.  Fort's books sold well and are still in print.  His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as \"Forteans\", and has influenced some aspects of science fiction.Context_3: Bob Rickard Robert \"Bob\" J M Rickard is the founder and editor of the UK magazine \"Fortean Times: The Journal of Strange Phenomena\", which debuted in 1973 under its original title \"The News\".  The magazine's express purpose is to continue the documentary work of Charles Fort on the strange, anomalous and unexplained.  In addition to his editorial role, Rickard has written several books and hundreds of articles on a wide range of Fortean topics.  In 1981, he was a founding member of ASSAP and is also the founder of the Charles Fort Institute.Context_4: Bizarre (magazine) Bizarre was a British alternative magazine published from 1997 to 2015.  It was published by Dennis Publishing, and was a sister publication to the \"Fortean Times\".Context_5: Super-Sargasso Sea The Super-Sargasso Sea is the dimension into which lost things go, whose existence was proposed by Charles Fort, writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena.  It may be thought of as the spontaneous, anomalous teleportation of an object into another dimension.  Fort did not actually believe that it existed but, in the vein of the ancient Greek skeptics, he wished only to present a theory that was just as plausible as those in the mainstream.  The name alludes to the Sargasso Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, which lies next to the Bermuda Triangle.Context_6: Fortean Society The Fortean Society was started in the United States in 1931 during a meeting held in the New York flat of Charles Hoy Fort in order to promote the ideas of American writer Charles Fort.  The Fortean Society was primarily based in New York City.  Its first president was Theodore Dreiser, an old friend of Charles Fort, who had helped to get his work published.  Founding members of The Fortean Society included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott (and many of NYC's literati such as Dorothy Parker), and Baltimore writer H. L. Mencken.  Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller.  The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter \"Doubt\" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser.  Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues.  Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean.  During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of \"Doubt\" to espouse his politics.  Particularly, he frequently expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens.  In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax.Context_7: Vincent Gaddis Vincent Hayes Gaddis (December 28, 1913 \u2013 February 26, 1997) was an American author who invented the phrase \"Bermuda Triangle\", which he used first in the cover article for the 1964 February issue of the magazine \"Argosy\".

Corliss William Roger Corliss (August 28, 1926 \u2013 July 8, 2011) was an American physicist and writer who was known for his interest in collecting data regarding anomalous phenomena.  Arthur C.

Swords is a retired professor of Natural Science at Western Michigan University, who writes about general sciences and anomalous phenomena, particularly parapsychology, cryptozoology, and ufology, editing the academic publication \"The Journal of UFO Studies\".  He is a board member of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies.Context_10: The Book of the Damned The Book of the Damned was the first published nonfiction work of the author Charles Fort (first edition 1919).  Concerning various types of anomalous phenomena including UFOs, strange falls of both organic and inorganic materials from the sky, odd weather patterns, the possible existence of creatures generally believed to be mythological, disappearances of people, and many other phenomena, the book is considered to be the first of the specific topic of anomalistics.Fact_1: Bizarre (magazine)Fact_2: Bizarre (magazine)Fact_3: Fortean TimesFact_4: Fortean TimesQuestion: Which publishing company has published Bizarre and a sister publication devoted to the anomalous phenomena popularised by Charles Fort?",

He was the younger brother to Maurice Berkeley, \"de jure\" 4th Baron Berkeley, and had a younger brother, James, and younger sister, Anne.  On 9 September 1513 he fought in the Battle of Flodden and was knighted by the Earl of Surrey, Thomas Howard.  He later became Constable of Berkeley Castle on 15 May 1514, and Sheriff of Gloucestershire, November 1522 - November 1523.

Hines was the subject of a famous photo taken by Frank Hurley that depicted him surrounded by German military equipment and money he had looted during the Battle of Polygon Wood in September 1917.  This image is among the best-known Australian photographs of the war.Context_5: Baron Berkeley of Stratton Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in the County of Cornwall, was a title in the Peerage of England.  It was created in 1658 for John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, a Royalist supporter during the English Civil War, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family.  He was a descendant of Sir Maurice de Berkeley (14th century), younger son of Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (see Baron Berkeley).  Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge, was his brother and Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth, his nephew.  Lord Berkeley of Stratton's second son, the third Baron (who succeeded his elder brother), was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.  He died without surviving children and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron.  He was a politician and served as First Lord of Trade between 1714 and 1715.  On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the fifth Baron.  He was also a politician and held office as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-Pensioners.  He was childless and the title became extinct on his death in 1775.Context_6: Baron Berkeley The title Baron Berkeley originated as a feudal title and was subsequently created twice in the Peerage of England by writ.  It was first granted by writ to Thomas II de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (1245\u20131321), 6th feudal Baron Berkeley, in 1295, but the title of that creation became extinct at the death of his great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron by writ, when no male heirs to the barony by writ remained, although the feudal barony continued.  The next creation by writ was in 1421, for the last baron's nephew and heir James Berkeley.  His son and successor William was created Viscount Berkeley in 1481, Earl of Nottingham in 1483, and Marquess of Berkeley in 1488.  He had no surviving male issue, so the Marquesate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death in 1491, whilst the barony passed \"de jure\" to his younger brother Maurice.  However William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol.  Instead he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William's own rightful heirs.  Thus on the death of King Edward VI in 1553, Henry VII's unmarried grandson, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family.  Therefore, Maurice and his descendants from 1492 to 1553 were \"de jure\" barons only, until the return of the title to the senior heir Henry (and indirectly to his mother Anne), becoming \"de facto\" 7th Baron in 1553.  Upon his death he was succeeded by his relative George Harding.Context_7: Andrew Hines Andrew Hines (born May 25, 1983 in Villa Park, California) is a five-time National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock Motorcycle champion.

The Cactus Club took over The Bachelor Club and went on to become a legendary live music venue in San Jose for close to 15 years.  The concept of The Cactus Club was created by Sean Galvin and Mike Trippett.  It was Producer/Promoter Ric Hines who made the opening of the Cactus Club possible with his business experience and professional network.

The canal is fed by the Savannah River and passes through three levels (approximately 13 miles total) in suburban and urban Augusta before the water returns to the river at various locations.  It was devised to harness the water power at the fall line of the Savannah River to drive mills, to provide transportation of goods, and to provide a municipal water supply.  It is the only canal in the US in continuous use for its original purposes of providing power, transport and municipal water.Context_2: 17th Street Canal The 17th Street Canal is the largest and most important drainage canal in the city of New Orleans.  Operating with Pump Station 6, It moves water into Lake Pontchartrain.  The canal, along with the Orleans Canal and the London Avenue Canal, form the New Orleans Outfall Canals.

Shortly afterwards, the road elevates on an overpass to cross the Norfolk Southern Railway and returns to ground level as it crosses the Industrial Canal on the Almonaster Avenue Bridge, a bascule bridge that it shares with CSX Transportation, proceeding into New Orleans East.  The traffic lanes straddle the railroad bridge on either side; this is the only location where Almonaster becomes a two-lane road, albeit divided.  It is also the last of the combination railroad/automobile movable bridges.  It winds through the New Orleans Business and Industrial District (NO BID) parallel with the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.  It intersects with Interstate 510 before finally ending at the junction with U.S. Highway 90.

Started in 1954, and completed in 1988, it is navigable over much of its 1375 km length, and carries 13 km3 of water annually from the Amu-Darya River across the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan.  The canal opened up huge new tracts of land to agriculture, especially to cotton monoculture heavily promoted by the Soviet Union, and supplying Ashgabat with a major source of water.  Unfortunately, the primitive construction of the canal allows almost 50\u00a0percent of the water to escape en route, creating lakes and ponds along the canal, and a rise in groundwater leading to widespread soil salinization problems.  The canal is also a major factor leading to the Aral Sea environmental disaster.Context_5: New Orleans Outfall Canals There are three outfall canals in New Orleans, Louisiana \u2013 the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals.

        "input":"Context_1: Gupta script The Gupta script (sometimes referred to as Gupta Brahmi Script or Late Brahmi Script) was used for writing Sanskrit and is associated with the Gupta Empire of India which was a period of material prosperity and great religious and scientific developments.  The Gupta script was descended from Brahmi and gave rise to the N\u0101gar\u012b, Sharada and Siddham scripts.  These scripts in turn gave rise to many of the most important scripts of India, including Devanagari (the most common script used for writing Sanskrit since the 19th century), the Gurmukhi script for Punjabi Language, the Bengali-Assamese script, and the Tibetan script.Context_2: Coptic alphabet The Coptic alphabet is the script used for writing the Coptic language.  The repertoire of glyphs is based on the Greek alphabet augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic and is the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language.  There are several Coptic alphabets, as the Coptic writing system may vary greatly among the various dialects and subdialects of the Coptic language.Context_3: Modi alphabet Modi (Marathi: \u092e\u094b\u0921\u0940 , M\u014d\u1e0d\u012b , ] ) is a script used to write the Marathi language, which is the primary language spoken in the state of Maharashtra, India.  There are at least two different theories concerning its origin.  Modi was an official script used to write Marathi until the 20th century when the Balbodh style of the Devanagari script was promoted as the standard writing system for Marathi.  Although Modi was primarily used to write Marathi, other languages such as Urdu, Kannada, Gujarati, Rajasthani, Hindi is also known to have been written in Modi.Context_4: Southeastern Iberian script The southeastern Iberian script, also known as Meridional Iberian, was one of the means of written expression of the Iberian language, which was written mainly in the northeastern Iberian script and residually by the Greco-Iberian alphabet.  About the relation between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, it is necessary to point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs; however it is clear that they had a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script derives from southeastern Iberian script.  In fact, the southeastern Iberian script is very similar, both considering the shape of the signs or their values, to the Southwestern script used to represent an unknown language usually named Tartessian.  The main difference is that southeastern Iberian script doesn\u2019t show the vocalic redundancy of the syllabic signs.  Unlike the northeastern Iberian script the decipherment of the southeastern Iberian script is not yet complete, because there are a significant number of signs on which scholars have not yet reached a consensus.  Despite it is believed that unlike the northeastern Iberian script the southeastern Iberian script doesn\u2019t show any system to differentiate between voiced and unvoiced occlusives, a recent paper (Ferrer i Jan\u00e9 2010) defends the existence of a dual system also in the southeastern Iberian script.Context_5: Balbodh Balbodh (Marathi: \u092c\u093e\u0933\u092c\u094b\u0927 , b\u0101\u1e37ab\u014ddha , ] , Translation: Understood by Children) is a slightly modified style of the Devanagari script used to write the Marathi language and the Korku language.  What sets Balbodh apart from the Devananagari script used for other languages is the more frequent and regular use of both \u0933 /\u026d/ (retroflex lateral approximant) and \u0930\u094d\u200d (called the eyelash reph/raphar).Context_6: Hebrew alphabet The Hebrew alphabet (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05e3\u05be\u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u200e , \"Alefbet Ivri \"), known variously by scholars as the Jewish script, square script and block script, is an abjad script used in the writing of the Hebrew language, also adapted as an alphabet script in the writing of other Jewish languages, most notably in Yiddish (lit.  \"Jewish\" for Judeo-German), Djud\u00edo (lit.  \"Jewish\" for Judeo-Spanish), and Judeo-Arabic.  Historically, there have been two separate abjad scripts to write Hebrew.  The original, old Hebrew script, is known as the paleo-Hebrew alphabet (which has been largely preserved, in an altered form, in the Samaritan alphabet), while the present \"Jewish script\" or \"square script\" to write Hebrew is a stylized form of the Aramaic alphabet and was known by Jewish sages as the Ashuri alphabet (lit.  \"Assyrian\"), since its origins were alleged to be from Assyria.  Various \"styles\" (in current terms, \"fonts\") of representation of the Jewish script letters described in this article also exist, as well as a cursive form which has also varied over time and place, and today is referred to as cursive Hebrew.  In the remainder of this article, the term \"Hebrew alphabet\" refers to the Jewish square script unless otherwise indicated.Context_7: Elbasan alphabet The Elbasan script is a mid 18th-century alphabetic script used for the Albanian language.  It was named after the city of Elbasan, where it was invented, and was used mainly in the area of Elbasan and Berat, and is the oldest original script used to write Albanian.Context_8: Siddha\u1e43 script Siddha\u1e43 , also known in its later evolved form as Siddham\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101, is the name of a script used for writing Sanskrit from c. 550 \u2013 c. 1200.  It is descended from the Brahmi script via the Gupta script and later evolved into the Assamese alphabet, the Bengali alphabet, and the Tibetan alphabet.  There is some confusion over the spelling: \"Siddh\u0101\u1e43 \" and \"Siddha\u1e43 \" are both common, though \"Siddha\u1e43 \" is preferred as \"correct\".  The script is a refinement of the script used during the Gupta Empire.Context_9: Cuneiform script Cuneiform script ( or or ), one of the earliest systems of writing, was invented by the Sumerians.  It is distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus.
