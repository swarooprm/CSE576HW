    "Definition": "In this task, a sentence and the relation between the input sentence and the output sentence that has to be generated are given as input. The output of this task is to generate another sentence that satisfies the relation specified in the input. If the category is specified as Entailment, then the hypothesis i.e., output sentence has a similar meaning to the given input sentence, which is a premise. Contradiction means the hypothesis i.e., the output sentence must have an opposite meaning to the given premise i.e., the input sentence. ",
