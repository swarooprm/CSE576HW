We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . \n Person 2:  That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . \n Person 1:  You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? ",

Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . \n Person 1:  Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? \n Person 2:  Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . \n Person 1:  It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . \n Person 2:  That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . \n Person 1:  And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . \n Person 2:  But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . \n Person 1:  Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . \n Person 2:  Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time .

To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? \n Person 1:  I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . \n Person 2:  Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . \n Person 1:  Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . \n Person 2:  But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? \n Person 1:  Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . \n Person 2:  I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? \n Person 1:  That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . \n Person 2:  Really ? \n Person 1:  Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . \n Person 2:  Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? \n Person 1:  Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . \n Person 2:  How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? \n Person 1:  That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . \n Person 2:  So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? \n Person 1:  Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . \n Person 2:  Why did they want to found a college ? \n Person 1:  Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . \n Person 2:  Oh , I see . \n Person 1:  Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . \n Person 2:  When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? \n Person 1:  In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . \n Person 2:  It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . \n Person 1:  Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . \n Person 2:  Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . \n Person 1:  Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . \n Person 2:  I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . \n Person 1:  Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . \n Person 2:  That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . \n Person 1:  You can ask me any question at any time . ",

This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . \n Person 1:  You are making me feel really discouraged . \n Person 2:  I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! ",

I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? \n Person 2:  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . \n Person 1:  Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! \n Person 2:  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . \n Person 1:  I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . \n Person 2:  Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . \n Person 1:  Alright .

But what about getting started once you have an idea ? \n Person 1:  After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . \n Person 2:  Sounds like a lot of work ! \n Person 1:  Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . ",

So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . \n Person 2:  Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . \n Person 1:  Alright . Great . \n Person 2:  So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . \n Person 1:  Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? \n Person 2:  Are you alright ? Can you do more ? \n Person 1:  I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . \n Person 2:  That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . \n Person 1:  What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . \n Person 2:  We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? \n Person 1:  Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . ",

In New Berlin ? \n Person 1:  No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . \n Person 2:  I understand . They think a tornado might come . \n Person 1:  Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . \n Person 2:  And the second stage is called a tornado warning . \n Person 1:  Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . \n Person 2:  It's scary . \n Person 1:  Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . \n Person 2:  What do you mean a loud train ? \n Person 1:  That is what tornadoes sound like .

It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . \n Person 2:  Have you seen a lot of them ? \n Person 1:  I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . \n Person 2:  Did it hit their house ? \n Person 1:  No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . \n Person 2:  What were they doing when you called ? \n Person 1:  They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . \n Person 2:  That's terrible .

Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . \n Person 2:  If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . \n Person 1:  How would you do that ? \n Person 2:  I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . \n Person 1:  I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . \n Person 2:  I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . \n Person 1:  The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . \n Person 2:  That ’ s a good point .

Lin put you in charge of marketing ? \n Person 1:  He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . \n Person 2:  Where will it be ? \n Person 1:  We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . \n Person 2:  Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? \n Person 1:  Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . \n Person 2:  Great . \n Person 1:  Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . \n Person 2:  You seem excited about it . \n Person 1:  Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . \n Person 2:  Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . \n Person 1:  Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . \n Person 2:  The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? \n Person 1:  It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . \n Person 2:  Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . \n Person 1:  That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . \n Person 2:  Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . ",
