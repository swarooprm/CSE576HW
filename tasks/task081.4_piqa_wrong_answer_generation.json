Apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections using a cotton swab or small piece of cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, you may see it bubble and foam, as it reacts with the corrosion. When the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped out. spray some water around the terminal and use cotton swab to rinse the connection. Wipe the terminals clean with a dry clean rag. Add something hydrophobic, such as petroleum jelly or grease to the now cleaned terminals. This will help slow future corrosion.
