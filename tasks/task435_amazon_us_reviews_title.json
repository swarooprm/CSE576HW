In fact, I bought three version of this stylus, the first one I bought from BestBuy (the black one) and the first thing what I noticed when I opened the box of this one was the better quality of the product. The paint is with rubber which is giving you a better grip (probably because is made in Japan ;-) not China). The diameter of the nib is smaller (6 mm) which is giving you a better accuracy on your writing/sketching. It has also a good weight, closer to a real pen.<br /><br />- It has indeed a problem breaking very easy the nub (my daughter broke one in one day, but she is three years old :-) and was pushing hard on poor thing).<br /><br />- Comment for manufacturer: is really easy to fix this problem just make a larger radius (instead of chamfer) on the metal... And also I want to see Duo in multiple colors too :-)<br /><br />Overall I will recommend this stylus. Thanks!",

I decided to get GTX 600 series card rather than a Radeon 7000 series because Nvidia has a more stable average FPS. Even with higher FPS on AMD, Nvidia may look smoother because the average FPS is more consistent. Maybe AMD will fix that in the future. GTX 660 is a better value because for $100 less you get 10%-15% less performance.  Many have OC GTX 660 Ti to 670 performance.<br /><br />The card is very quiet especially compared to the Radeon HD 4870 I replaced.  I won't compare the cards any further because they are generations apart.

Finally this product solves the problem with the bi-directional protocol you need with modern printers. It is like a USB port sharing throught the network, so the devices connect to your computer like there are connected to your USB local port. The sharing is not at the same time, you have to connect and disconnect your devices so other users can use them. It has two features that helps you sharing among other users: one feature is for printers, that connects and disconnets the printer on demand, so other users don't have to request it, and the second is for other device types, you can request the other user to disconnect the device if you need it.     This product is for home networks, or very small offices.    The only thing that prevented me to put 5 stars is the speed, of course it is not like the native USB port, because you use IP protocol and then a wireless adapter, that's far from 400 Mbps.    One last thing: the hub itself is not wireless, like it says at the box, and many other reviwers noted, but at least you can connect it to your Access Point independently of the Wireless technology. If you migrate from your old b or g to the new N, you don't loose your HUB.",

In my tech cupboard you'll find two prized Microsoft Intellimouse Trackballs -- and I mean the really stodgy, ovoid 1990s model issued in sexy beige and grey.  While they may have looked like artificial kneecaps, they sure worked!  These old, well-used gadgets serve less today as go-to gear than reminders of being spared in an early brush with carpal tunnel.  I've never since found a design as comfortable.  They saw me through the composition of a 12-volume reference set and, more happily, countless games of Quake II.<br /><br />The Orbit under review here is a pretty good replacement.  I'll start with what I can praise: fit.  Over time in my average-sized hand, I've stopped noticing it.  That for me is a baseline measure of any I/O device's success.  It becomes invisible, as it should.  I've never noticed any soreness or irritation, whether sitting or standing.  Well done, Kensington, on this score.<br /><br />Next, I have to take points off for both the cheaply-made buttons and the lame ring-based scrolling mechanism.  The buttons misfire occasionally due to their clunky construction.  And compared to another more successful ring-shaped scroller -- the touchpad on my elegant Logitech diNovo Edge keyboard -- this implementation's way too fussy.  Far too often you track, but it doesn't.<br /><br />A warning about the included USB dongle.  If you break or lose this tiny fingernail-sized receiver, your $50 trackball is toast.  So I learned tonight when inquiring if I could buy a spare so I wouldn't have to constantly relocate mine between systems.  While this may be understandable (the pairing is done uniquely at the factory) it also reveals the manufacturer simply doesn't care about longevity.  Bluetooth would have been a far better idea for extending the life of what will, in too many cases, become a disposable product.<br /><br />So there you have it: a comfortable shape with moderate-to-iffy construction featuring a partly-workable scrollingmechanism, all of it tied for its survival to a 25-cent irreplaceable dongle by a manufacturer that will throw its hands up if something happens to yours.  I don't need to add that I doubt this trackball will be around nearly as long as its predecessors.",

From the first digital camera I had many years ago, I always got better response from the Lexar one as compared with other brands. First it was 4X, then, 8X then 16X, then 40X, then 80X, then 133X, now 300X. My cameras went from 3.3 MP then several 8 MP, now 12.8 MP so there was a need for faster and larger cards. Well Lexar has kept up. I now have 5 of the 8GB 300X. I still use the 8 GB 133X as well as some 40 and 80X cards. The difference I notice is down loading my images to my computer, the 300X is way faster with a proper card reader. Even with the express card reader on my laptop in the field the 300X card downloads the 8 GB faster. Also when shooting a burst of pictures, whether its getting the right image at sporting events or a bird in flight, with either my Canon 20D or now the Canon 5D, I never have to wait for the files to write to the cards.    I like the peace of mind that comes from the quality of Lexar products. I spend a lot of time, effort, and money getting the images and the thought of loosing them due to card problems is unimaginable. I also no doubt will be getting the Canon 1DS Mark IIII  in the near future, and like the idea than the cards I am now using will be fast enough to keep up with the 21 MP camera. So no regrets.    Well off to Alaska with my Lexar cards,    Albert Mach Fine Art & Custom Framing",

I use a 24\\\\\" LCD that has a fluorescent backlight ([[ASIN:B000QEITJE Samsung SyncMaster 245T 24\\\\\" LCD Monitor]]) and the difference is best described as going from a fluorescent light to an incandescent.     The glasses have a yellow tint, but once I wore them for a few minutes and compared the glasses/no-glasses view, the no-glasses view felt cold and harsh.    Second, they are light. As a non-glasses-wearing type, I worried a bit about how they would feel, but they are fine.    Third, they fit snugly, but not tightly. This is a total bonus, since your face is probably different than mine.    Finally, a comment about the price. I paid $99 through Amazon. It felt a bit expensive, but I rationalized it as such: I stare at a computer about 12 hours a day during the week and about 5 hours a day during the weekend. This is about 3600 hours a year staring at a screen. If they last me a year, I will have paid 2.75 cents per hour of use.",

I have had my SD burner for over two years and commend the Digimagic people for making it easier to store my photos, and not clog up my hardrive.    When I first got it, I had to have the technician walk me through the steps of inserting the SD card and what button to push, as I have a disability that makes reading the computer jargon instructions difficult.  The EZ PnP Tech. people are very accomodating, and helpful!    After I placed the SD chip in the front slot, and placed the CD in the carrier, which looks just like the CD player carrier on your PC or Laptop, and when the DM220P08  had formatted and booted up and was convinced that the CD was ready it went to town, it copied all 150 photos in just about 4-5 minutes, it then initialized the disc, beeps, and spits out a completed CD.      For general shooting, I just use a CD, and it can accomodate four burns on a one gig SD chip before telling you to switch out the CD for a new one when full, and completes the burn.  It automatically picks up at the end of the last burn, and starts the next installment, and makes a new folder that shows up on your computer's hard drive area as a EZPnp disc icon.  So when you click on the icon, it shows how many burns you have on that CD/DVD.    So all you DSLR users with monster 24mp cameras out there with your 16 gig chips in your cameras, you will just have to use DVD's for your massive storage needs.     DVD's are incredible though, I have only filled one so far, and that was when I shot tons of photos while in Salt Lake City last Thanksgiving.  I was doing a Missionary a good deed and taking some shots of his home and family for a Christmas present to him.  I shot over 300 6mp full res shots, and it barely even bothered the CD, I could have placed two hundred more shots on that one.    I take it everywhere I go for photo shoots!  And with just four DVD's I can down load a ton of shots that would otherwise have crashed my hard drive, and by formatting the chips, can take another ton of shots.  I have a cheapy plastic CD file box with all my photo Disc's, and there are over two thousand shots with the name of the shoot written with a sharpie on the CD/DVD's for simple identification .    There is only one drawback that kept me from giving it a five star rating, and that is you can't play the CD or DVD's on the home TV in your DVD player, so without owning the DM220P08 and having the patch cords, you will have to view them on your gift CD/DVD's on your PC or Laptop.     By the way! It is as small as a portable CD player and fits anywhere for trips and photo shoots.    So until EZ PnP people get permission to be able to make a burner that is CD/DVD to TV DVD player compatible, you will just have to view the shots on your PC or Laptop.",

I also use this computer for basic internet functions (Facebook, e-mails, browsing), but I also watch a lot of movies and TV shows, too. I bought a VGA cable to connect to the plasma TV, and the picture looks great (compared to my boyfriend's older laptop). The video card is just amazing. I think watching a movie through my computer on the TV actually looks better than watching a DVD.    The only complaint I have about this notebook, which is true for all newer HP notebooks, is the touchpad. It's not easy to scroll webpages sometimes, and the sensitivity varies. Sometimes it is hard to select by tapping, and other times, I accidentally click on something because it is too sensitive. I would recommend getting a wireless mouse, and disabling the touchpad.

Actually, this mini-messenger bag is the MODERN FANNY-PACK; perfect for the on-the-go traveler who needs to carry cash/cards, phone, iPad, chargers, passport, etc.",

I also run a  MacBook Pro off the access point part of the bridge over 5GHz wireless-N with stable connection and no issues whatsoever.    The device is well designed, with nice touches abound. It looks stylish with piano black finish on the sides and clear lucite panel in front, and fits nicely on a typical book shelf. There are two Ethernet ports in the back so if you have only two devices, you won't even need a switch on the bridge end. The genius touch is that you can turn off all LEDs on the box, including both front panel power/traffic and rear panel port status LEDs, so there is no annoying blinking in a darkened room!

Given its positive reviews, and guarantee, I purchased this moderately costly protector with high expectations. I followed the application directions to a \\\\\"T\\\\\"; the protector fit perfectly but suffered two bubbles about the size of a pencil eraser, about one-half inch from the edge - bubbles that cannot be squeegeed off and seem to be permanent. As they are at the edge of the viewing area they pose no visual problem; their presence nags, nevertheless.    What does present as a problem, however, is that the film has stippling defects (looks like an orange peel) within the visible screen area. The defects are annoying because they reflect light from the screen as does a gem stone, i.e., they sparkle as the device is moved. I should think that the manufacturer ought to be able to produce sheets without such defects, especially given their cost.    In its enclosed literature, the manufacturer entreats customers to contact them before writing a negative review on Amazon, assuring customers that they will \\\\\"promptly rectify the issue and do what we can do to earn a positive review.\\\\\" While a laudable and reasonable request, it is not worth it to me to expend my resources (time, energy, and money) to seek to rectify the issue.    Over the years, I have purchased a few two- or three-protector packs for different phones for a couple for bucks each. None of them had visible defects, they all applied easily without serious bubbles, and never suffered from excess scratching; and I have the remaining protectors as replacements if/when needed. When needed, I will do the same for the Fire HD and get a two- or three-protector pack at a cheaper cost than this Skinomi - and - apart from saving money, I probably will not be able to tell the difference. My advice, purchase theinexpensive two- or three-protector packs here at Amazon as this Skinomi is no better than the inexpensive ones, came defective whereas the inexpensive ones were not, and the inexpensive ones do the same job.

Its price of $55 (at Amazon.com as of February 29, 2012) is about 45% more than the price of a competitor's USB 3.0 4-port hub, which Amazon.com also sells (for $38.88 as of February 29, 2012). If you don't plan to connect printers and scanners or other power-hungry devices through the hub, the competitor's hub will probably satisfy your needs. However, if you plan to connect power-hungry devices, I highly recommend this hub, despite its substantially higher price, or any competitor's hub with similar specifications. I believe that with this hub, you can rest assured that whatever USB 3.0 or USB 2.0 device you connect to the hub, the device will work.<br /><br />Before buying the U.S. Robotics hub, I contacted the manufacturer to inquire whether the hub would support power-hungry USB 2.0 devices. The manufacturer's representative assured me that the hub would do so. The representative stated that the manufacturer had tested the hub on a broad range of USB devices varying in power requirements. Furthermore, the representative stated that if the hub did not support a USB 2.0 device, I could return the hub to the manufacturer (during the warranty period) for a refund of my purchase price if the retailer (Amazon.com in this case) would not refund the price for any reason.<br /><br />Previously, I purchased and used another manufacturer's USB 3.0 4-port hub. The hub's adapter has an output rating of 2A. Unfortunately, the hub would not support certain power-hungry USB 2.0 devices that I used. Thus, I had to continue to use my USB 2.0 hubs for those devices and to carry a USB 2.0 hub with me along with the USB 3.0 hub when on the road to be certain that whatever USB 2.0 device I might want to connect through a hub would work.<br /><br />On February 23, I purchased the U.S. Robotics hub in the hope that it would support all my USB 2.0 devices. It has proved itself in every way. With the U.S. Robotics hub, I can retire my USB 2.0 hubs and carry only one hub with me on the road. The U.S. Robotic hub's adapter has an output rating of 4A, twice the other hub's output. U.S. Robotics states that the output at each port is 900mA for USB 3.0 devices, the maximum allowed for such devices. Presumably, the hub's output is 500 mA for USB 2.0 devices, for which the maximum allowed is 500 mA.<br /><br />My USB 2.0 devices that work on the U.S. Robotics hub and did not work on the other manufacturer's hub are: (1) Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II color-photo printer, (2) Epson Perfection V750-M Pro scanner, (3) HP Color LaserJet CP3525dn printer (643 w. max), and (4) Kodak i1220 scanner. A USB 2.0 HP LaserJet P2055dn (570 w. max) works on both hubs. My Western Digital USB 2.0 and 3.0 hard drives also work on both hubs.<br /><br />I prefer the U.S. Robotics hub not only because it supports all my current USB 3.0 and 2.0 devices, but because U.S. Robotics has thoroughly tested its hub to support many USB 2.0 devices and has assured me (with an oral money-back guarantee, as noted above) that the hub will work with any USB 3.0 or 2.0 device. The adapter's output rating of 4A and 900mA at each port for USB 3.0 devices gives me the confidence that enough power will be available at each port to support any USB 3.0 and 2.0 device I may use in the future.<br /><br />If you can find another hub whose adapter has an output rating of 4A, that provides 900 mA of power to each port for USB 3.0 devices when all four ports are in use, that has been similarly tested, for which the manufacturer provides a similar assurance, and at a lower price, by all means, purchase that hub. I would so so, too. While the U.S. Robotics hub meets my needs now, if a competitor makes available a similar hub at a lower price, even if the U.S. Robotics hub's price may decline over time, I would not hesitate to purchase the competitor's hub. Until such time comes, I recommend the U.S. Robotics hub so you won't have to be concerned that some devices may not be supported by the hub.",

First off, do not mess around with the i5 versions, and invest the extra money on this solid platform based on the latest i7 technology. Though I was initially disappointed that the memory was soldered to the motherboard and not field upgradeable, there were so many other things I just loved about this product.<br /><br />First, it is less than 2 ounces heavier than the Macbook Air, so this is not really a major factor. The graphics are wonderful, and one of the best aspects is how Asus is willing to standard behind their product with a 1-year Accidental Damage Protection (ADP) policy FREE (!!!) that covers your investment in the event of an unforeseen accident.  I am sure the Best Buy sales folks don't explain this one when they push their warranty!!!<br /><br />Next, the box is loaded with everything you need to make the most of this product ... unlike the Macbook Air where you have another $100-150 of investment.  Items that were absent from the \\\\\"What's in the box\\\\\" include a VGA Adapter and a USB-to-Ethernet Adapter. The computer also has a USB 3.0 port (side), as well as a USB 2.0 one (left side). Be careful here ... I immediately reloaded my Zen in a tri-boot configuration of Windows 7 Ultimate, CentOS and Backtrack 5R2. Windows will NOT load if you connect your external DVD to the USB 3.0 port, as the PXE does not recognize the port and you will get errors about missing drivers and you will not see the SSD drive. Once Win7 was initially loaded, I did visit the Asus site to download all the relevant drivers.  With CentOS, Ubuntu and Backtrack ... no drivers were required, as these OS's recognized everything out of the box.<br /><br />The built-in WLAN adapter (Broadcomm) works with Backtrack 5R2, but does not support injection, but can be placed in monitor mode. This is not a major problem, as I have found this to be the case with many laptop/netbook WLAN adapters - so I always carry an extra WLAN NIC just for the occasion!<br /><br />Battery life appears to be more than sufficient - especially if you put Windows in Power Saver mode.  Once everything was installed, the machine worked like a champ!<br /><br />This product is thin, light, and very durable, and will be a great compliment to my Macbook Pro when traveling without adding much to the tote!",

Books in an eBook format (either from Kindle store on Amazon, mailed and converted PDF (best option for most PDFs), uploaded MOBI and converted/uploaded EPUB (both using Calibre) are easy to read.  Three problems.  First, PDFs are almost impossible to read.  The screen is too small to read a whole page at a time, and the zooming and cropping are poorly designed (I need to enlarge 110%, 120%, 130%, NOT 150%) and the scrolling when enlarged makes the document unreadable.  It should be smooth, or have that as an option.  [Solved--problem was in the leather cover, which was replaced by Amazon w/o cost to me.  Cudos] Second, my Kindle [no longer] locks up all the time, and will not turn on to normal reset sequences.  It takes some cryptic combination of long (>15s) and shorter (until the light comes on again) use of the switch to get it to come back to life.  This happens nearly every time, and totally resets the device (\\\\\"reboots\\\\\").  Finally, the way it tracks how far read is fine for non-fiction, but if your book includes an appendix at the end, it will always take you to that, rather than as far as you have always read, even if you only visited the appendix once or twice.  All that aside, it is handy.

I've used many different LCD monitors and while my favorite continues to be the Apple 20&quot; Cinema display, this is now my 2nd favorite (and as I am getting accustomed to the pivot feature, the Apple display may be in trouble...). Yes, it comes with a pivot display mount that not only allows you to raise, lower, tilt and turn the montior to any position imaginable, it also lets you rotate the screen 90 degrees to portrait mode. Unlike the more expensive rotatable monitors that have an 'auto-sensing' thingie which automatically switch your display output between portrait and landscape based on the position of the monitor, this one requires you to use a software utility (included) to manually select the orientation of the output. To be honest, I didn't even realize this was a feature on this monitor. I based my initial purchase decision on the manufacturer specs and price. Since this was intended to replace a 21&quot; Sony CRT on my development PC, image quality was secondary to form factor and price. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the display and I was extremely pleased to discover the rotation feature.<br /><br /> I was originally going to mount this monitor on a VESA arm, but after using the included stand, I'm having second thoughts. The stand itself is the best that I've ever seen on an LCD monitor. It allows for good cable management and almost infinite adjustability while not presenting a huge footprint.<br /><br /> Anyway, so far, this seems to be an outstanding monitor for the price (actually cheaper than many crappier 17&quot; LCDs I've seen). Though, you do need to shop around for the best price since I've seen it range from $549 to $800+. It's unusual to see such a wide range in the street price. I ended up getting it from Amazon because with the free 'super saver free shipping', it came out to be darn near the best deal (and I've had nothing but good experiences with Amazon so far).<br /><br /> Conclusion - do NOT buy one of these monitors! At this price and value, you NEED to get at least two (dual monitor setups are shweeeeet!!). :-)be darn near the best deal (and I've had nothing but good experiences with Amazon so far). <br />  <br /> Conclusion - do NOT buy one of these monitors!

You are forgetting the memory that needs to be required for the HDD to function. This was very easy installing it to the PS3. It gave me 860 gigabytes which is quite an awful lot than the usual 500 bytes that local retailers offer on their systems.<br /><br />Here are some hints as to installing the hard drive.<br />Save all saved games, music, videos, and photos unto a hard drive with a usb that can be read by the PS3.<br />Next, take off the tab under the PS3, there is a blue screw hidden within a small tab. The PS3 that I bought was from this year so it is different than the others where the tab is located on the side.<br />Then, pull down a clip that you will see once you slide the black tab to the right. Take off the four screws that hold the HDD in place. Make sure not to damage the screws. Then put in the new HDD of your size.<br />Turn on the PS3 and make sure that your PS3 control is connected through the USB to your PS3.<br />You will need a USB flash drive that needs to have an update of 4.25.<br />Go to the playstation website to download this file. As soon as you have it on the flash drive hook it up to the PS3 and the system will read it and start to format and create a new PS3 HDD.<br />VERY EASY TO DO!!!!!",

I moved from a Wacom that served me faithfully for almost ten years, and I was really nervous about getting something new, but the Ugee M1000L is quite adequate. My personal favorite things about it:<br /><br />1. It can be switched from right-handed to left-handed, so I can have my shortcut keys on the right.<br />2. Every button/key can be customized, and there are SO many of them! Very useful and handy.<br />3. The customer service I received when I was having trouble setting up was very good. Ugee was polite, quick to respond, and provided screenshots and instructions to help me.<br />4. Excellent sensitivity in the pen - I use my tablet to draw in Photoshop so having pressure sensitivity for the pen width is important. It's also nice to be able to customize one of the pen buttons to change it to &#34;eraser mode&#34;.<br /><br />Things that could be improved:<br /><br />1. The instructions are a little hard to understand; they read like they were generated in another language and a non-native speaker approved the English version. I was confused a couple of times by them because of poor sentence structure or vague terms.<br />2. All of the customizable buttons already have pictures next to them describing what the default setting is, which is nice if you're not going to change any of them, but not so nice if you customize them a lot (e.g., I have to remember that the button labeled &#34;Close Window&#34; is now my &#34;Shift&#34; button). I'm sure I'll get used to looking at one thing and having it do another, but I also might just try to rub off/color with a marker on the ones I've changed.<br />3. The driver CD that came with the tablet did not have the most recent driver, which caused a little confusion in the beginning for me because the tablet control panel looked different than in the instructions. If Ugee keeps updating their drivers, they shouldn't bother putting outdated drivers into the tablet package and just have people download straight from the website, as I had to do.<br /><br />The cons are not enough to keep this from being a 5-star product. I love it and hope to use it for ever and ever.<br /><br />One last tip - be ABSOLUTELY SURE that you completely uninstall any other tablet drivers/software on your computer, including Ugee software. I ran into some trouble while installing because different drivers were clashing with each other.",

            "input": "You can run an E8400 or Q9505 in this small form factor PC. So while the other Atom-based units are the same size, the power that you can get from this unit is head and shoulders above them. The unit uses a laptop-like power block so there is no power supply inside the box, so no fan required for this. So the unit is incredibly quiet. It has a specially designed heatsink that keeps the temperature down by having two small and quiet fans extracting the air out through the heatsink.  The unit can hold a Slim DVD/CD as well as two 2.5\\\\\" drives, in piggy back style, or three drives if you wish. The unit comes with the small sized power/sata connector, which you need for a slim DVD drive - you don't have to buy one. I am running Vista 32 bit on it and it works a dream with a fairly reasonable score of 4.1 for the onboard graphics. You can't add a graphics card so you have to be happy with these figures or don't buy it.   The unit doesn't have a VGA output, so you need a DVI to VGA adapter if this is required, hardly an issue other than additional length added to the rear. The front of the unit has a large circular power button, blue led lit. Below this is a small orange LED for HDD activity.  Unless you are sitting it flat you need the stand or VESA mount adapter. You can buy a VESA mount adapter specifically for this model, which I bought and screwed into my desk shelf, alternatively there is a stand that keeps it vertical and allows a gap at its base to allow air flow. You can't stand it on its side directly on a surface because the air flows through one side and out the other. The top, front, and back are sealed - Block one side off and cooling will be ineffective.  Completely happy with this unit bar one issue which I believe is poorly thought out by Shuttle. The cooling heat sink still uses push pins, why would they use push pins when they are building the unit themselves? Why not have fixed nuts below the motherboard and allow the heat sink to be screwed down and thus maximise not only cooling contact but also stability. Considering most people will mount this unit vertically, the heat sink ideally should be screwed in. Otherwise excellent, it is a small powerful PC which uses 90W instead of the usual PC power supply, say 350W+. So big difference in power useage with this. The only reason you wouldn't buy one is for gaming, the lack of graphics options may put you off. Also the price, face it, this is a motherboard mounted in a case with a power supply. You could buy a case and motherboard and save $50 at least. Also this unit only takes 65W processors, you can't put a big quad in it, it has to meet the 65W requirements. The Q9505 is the largest quad you can throw into it.   So really it is the size that sells it. Other things to consider, the plastic doors on the front open for USB port and headphone/mic access. They look good but they are cheap plastic, I don't use them but I would imagine if you did, they wouldn't have a long life. Also if mounting this sideways, the DVD has to be inserted vertically, so if the tray doesn't have a pinch type holder to press the DVD into, you aren't going to use it much. I plugged my full sized drive into the PC installed software and then removed it. From then on I can just use a USB portable DVD drive to install software if required. I can then kill of the DVD setting in the BIOS and get a quicker boot time with the HDD being the only drive onboard.",

When using a single drive I tested again a few months later (Using TRIM, at this time no RAID) and had absolutely no drop in performance speeds. I expect some degradation over time now because RAID doesn't support TRIM yet, but I am ok with secure erasing every 3 months or so until them come out with TRIM RAID support.<br /><br />For those slightly less tech savvy: this drive is VERY VERY fast, and is Well worth the money. You will absolutely see a difference in load speeds, especially in time it takes windows to load and time to open programs.

I upgraded because I could only get 25 Mbps download speed when I was paying for 50 Mbps.<br /><br />  **Please note that this is a CABLE modem and may not work with DSL service. Consult your ISP re: compatibility.<br /><br />I've had this modem for two weeks now and it works flawlessly. Setup was a breeze...it took me less than 10 minutes: ~2 minutes to connect to my Airport Time Capsule, then ~6 minutes to login to ISP site and complete new modem configuration process. The documentation included is easy to follow if you're less experienced and need a step by step guide to help you get up and running.<br />I average download speeds of 57 Mbps which exceeds the advertised speed for my service tier by 7 Mbps. My upload speed is right on target at 10 - 12 Mbps. I'm very pleased with the modem's performance.<br /><br />Based on my experience and other reviews, I do think Motorola made a batch of defective modems.  Download speeds with the first SB 6141 I received were EXTREMELY SLOW  at 1 to 2 Mbps. I spent 3 days trying to troubleshoot the problem with Comcast and Motorola. I even called Apple to see if my new router may have been causing the problem. It turns out I had a defective modem despite the Motorola rep telling me it was impossible for the modem to be the cause of my slow download speeds.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon to return the modem and I received a new one the next day. I haven't had any problems with the replacement SurfBoard 6141 that I received. I recommend buying from Amazon instead of direct from Motorola because customer service at the latter was suboptimal.<br /><br />I recommend buying this modem.

I don't know if my phone can handle the full 15w but my iPad does and it charges noticeably faster than the stock charger when it's the only thing plugged in.  I do wish it was just a split 50/50 design and not 5w/15w because there is no reason not to have the power available on the second port for a phone, that's a minor complaint though. This is a great replacement for iPad chargers but if you don't have a tablet that uses something besides micro-USB don't bother getting this because there is no way your device will be able to draw the full 3Amps, and if it somehow does I don't know how safe I would feel putting that much power through tiny microUSB pins.<br /><br />So in conclusion great for Apple devices I don't know how well it works with just regular microUSB devices but they should draw as much power as they need and hopefully the manufacturer of your device set the input impedance at something sensible so you don't end up with fried cables",

My experience with Logitech support was really easy, so they've got that going for them.<br /><br />I use these on a daily basis and here are my general thoughts:<br />-Comfort: Very comfortable. They breath well, so you can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Easily adjustable, and sleek. My only complaint is that the padding could be a little more comfortable. They're nowhere near as comfortable as my Sony MDR-XB500s.<br />-Sound: 7.1 is great for games like Counter Strike. I'm not an expert on sound, but they sound pretty good.<br />-Mic: I loved the mic's functionality for a few months until I broke it. I am pretty gentle with these, so that was a bummer. It no longer stays in the raised position.<br />-Programmable keys: I've used these almost exclusively for Spotify. You can have spotify running in the background and these will automatically Backward, Play/Pause, Forward your music for you. I use this all of the time, I love it. The volume wheel works as intended.<br />-Wireless: This is the only wireless headset I've ever owned, so I'm not sure if the issues are specific to this headset or to all wireless headsets. They work perfectly about 90% of the time. At random intervals, the headset will disconnect and reconnect in about 5 seconds. Sometimes the audio becomes fuzzy. The 10% of the time where they're working poorly is extremely frustrating. If you're watching a show, and have to rewind 10 seconds every few minutes, it becomes a real nuisance. These issues have been present with both G930s that I've owned.<br /><br />Note: These have no wired option. You can plug them in to charge, but it will still work on a wireless signal.<br /><br />If not for the wireless functionality issues, this would be a great headset. I would recommend getting a wired Logitech headset. The wireless is not worth the unpredictability. I usually like Logitech products a lot, and have nothing but good things to say about similar *wired* logitech headsets.ings to say about similar *wired* logitech headsets.",

That Operating System has wormed its features into 3 household computers and ASUS's use is just normal and acceptable for me.  It keeps me from having to relearn from computer to computer.<br /><br />I will, therefore, avoid discussing the elements of Win 8.1 and target the ASUS.  I have to remember ASUS is a essentially a laptop with all of its features and some of its drawbacks and a tablet with its large volume of uses.  Even though I have not had the time to test every single feature, I will say those that have not been tested are insignificant to my needs.  For example, I use the tablet when at home.  When on the road, I use a small device that I can leave in my pocket.  The front and rear cameras are excellent and of sufficient quality and pixel size to use for almost any need.  Keep in mind at this price point, the cameras are a positive addition.<br /><br />HDMI, Bluetooth and USB outlets provide considerable flexibility in the type of work on my platter.  In that regard, almost any data can be input or output via ASUS with its standard keyboard, touch screen and ability to access external drives.  The quality of the output is the same on this computer as are the other computers here.<br /><br />One condition present on the ASUS is a quick charging and slow discharging battery.  That's nice.  Additionally, the battery is accessible and readily changeable if and when that happens.  Its small size suggests that the weight of the computer is the responsibility of the electronics (SSD and other components) and not the battery completely,<br /><br />In today's markets we can look for a new computer until the whole herd comes home and still find models with this or not that.

So I think it can last 4-5hr with normal daily use.<br /><br />Good features: Keyboard can switch to number pad.Quiet fan and good ventilation. 4 2.0 USB ports all on the sides(my toshiba had 2 on the back which are less useful). 1.3M webcam works good.<br /><br />Performance: most of the 2008,2009 games are playable in detail graphics, 2010 games, some in high some in medium. (according to Benchmark graphics card) The only game I have tried so far is King's bounty2008. CPU temp went up to 65C, HD 38C in a RM temp that was 45F. In order to keep cool, the fan gets noisier.<br /><br />My complaints: Some featured software that I don't know how useful they are, however, they definitely slow down the Windows start. MOST FRUSTRATION COMES FROM WINDOWS 7 HOME PREMIUM. COMPATIBILITY ISSUE WITH MANY PROGRAMS I HAVE BEEN USING. SO THE FIRST FEW DAYS,I TRIED TO INSTALL SOFTWARE, ERRORS POP OUT AND CRASHED 4 TIMES.  OTHER LANGUAGE PACKS ARE EXCLUDED TO LURE ME TO UPGRADE TO ULTIMATE ($130). FOR BILINGUAL PEOPLE, IT CAN'T BE MORE FRUSTRATING WHEN PROGRAMS CAME OUT WITH ??%%??xx%%xxoo. THE OFFICE 2010 IS STARTER, NO POWERPOINT. MICROSOFT, I KNOW IT COST YOU A LOT MONEY DURING DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE IS NEARLY NO PRODUCTION COST. DON'T YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN MONOPOLY. I'LL PROBABLY INSTALL LINUX WITHIN NEXT FEW WEEKS. ALSO, LET US SWITCH TO OPEN OFFICE. BTW, BRICK GETS REALLY HOT WHEN PLAYING GAMES AND CHARGING.<br /><br />Updates: The screen goes black then come back when switching between battery and plugin. Firefox always crash when it happens.<br /><br />Overall, it is an above average laptop with good gaming ability. Portability can be improved, for instance, the brick, the dvd rom.<br /><br />ps. maybe heavy brick has more longevity???NG.<br /><br />Updates: The screen goes black then come back when switching between battery and plugin.

I've heard people say that their getting 10 days on a charge, I guess i'm lucky because I get at least at least 15 days on a single charge, and I use this thing every day.     The only issue I have with the Kindle is you cant map your buttons, I've been using it enough to the point that I really don't see how this isn't a feature that they considered right off the bat. I get the idea of having buttons on both sides of the kindle for changing the pages, but over time you will find yourself using the kindle in essentially your favourite position. Mine is the standard way with the qwerty keyboard at the bottom. I noticed this after about two days as I was playing a game and had to map my controller, I looked over at my kindle and said It's too bad i cant map that.

Coming from a Belkin N+ router from a few years ago, I'm amazed to see the range this thing can transmit, even in a moderately large house. PC Magazine reviews said it runs hot and there is a noticeable electronic odor. All I have to say is a lot of things run hot, including your cable box; this thing by comparison is much cooler, and emits no odor whatsoever (unless you're sniffing around the top, which would be strange in any event).<br /><br />If you just want the thing to work without hassle, and you can afford this, by all means, buy it. For those of us (myself partially included) who are only after the open-source support, maybe it's a good idea to wait (heck, maybe even build your own Arduino -based solution. I'm wondering if anyone's tried it yet). But for the rest of us laypeople who just need a functioning router, it's an excellent choice.",

I rearranged the power connectors inside my computer and when I went to plug in the molex connector a second time, I thought I about broke the power connector off the card. It was held in place by two small plastic pegs near the metal conductors, then two plastic clips near the edge of the card. I guess the force of pushing the molex connector into the card released those clips on the edge and the whole power connector bent back on the metal conductors. It took a little bit of maneuvering to seat it back in place and I think I am lucky that the none of the conductors were broken.<br /><br />As for the driver installation, I've installed a few add-on cards over the years (USB in old Windows 98 machines, IDE/RAID cards, etc) that include CD's with drivers from multiple vendors. Sometimes you can tell which folder to look in by looking at the chips on the add-on card, but that causes extra work if the card has already been installed in the computer. This installation CD wasn't as bad as it only had 4 vendor folders, and only one contained USB 3.0 drivers, but I think it makes installation unnecessarily confusing to the consumer when the installation CD's are packaged like this.",

The cutouts for the front and back camera are a little small, so you have to make sure they are positioned just right to use the cameras.  The case overall is nice as it securely fastens the tablet in the case.  The multiple angles to view the tablet in landscape mode is nice, wish there as a way to stand it up portrait as well, but you can't have everything.",

Initially I was trying to decide whether to purchase the G13 or the Razer Nostromo and i definitely made the right choice. The G13 has many more buttons (I use them all) and the joy stick is not a d-pad with a crappy covering.   Pros:  When I was deciding whether or not to purchase this, there were several reviews that really discouraged me, however, all of them were either wrong or didn't apply to me. The joy stick is not too pointy and actually feels wonderful. The contours of the pad are exceptional (I have medium to large hands). The software is also amazing and simple; drivers worked fine with windows 7. I use every single button on the device playing mmo's which is why this device has to be better than the nostromo. I didn't think i would use the lcd but it has proved very useful. The build quality is great. The tactile feel of the buttons is great.  Cons:  Here are a few minor complaints:  -The joy stick button is almost impossible to press to the point that there is no reason anyone is going to use it (i'm referring to pressing the joy stich itself, not the buttons around it).  -There is currently an issue with the software or drivers that cause the device to become nonfunctional when the computer wakes from standbye. The only remedy to this currently is to resart your computer or unplug and replug the device, however, i'm sure this will be fixed in the next update.

We want the stand to be as cool as the highly engineered device we are putting on it.  Lastly, take a lesson from Apple on packaging.  It does matter.

Glad I did.<br /><br />Taking place in Paris immediately following the Franco-Prussian War, the show is steeped in the mores of the period, and it does well in transporting you into that world. The story is centered around a particular government-run bordello, or \\\\\"maison close,\\\\\" named Paradis (I don't know if \\\\\"Paradis\\\\\" existed in history, but the characters at times mention a competing brothel, \\\\\"le Chabanais,\\\\\" which did exist in Paris, and was quite famous).<br /><br />There is a fair amount of depth to the plot, and if you are paying attention to the subtitles instead of the subtleties, it's easy to miss the facial expressions and mannerisms that help to tell the story, and you're likely to miss some understanding of why characters behave as they do towards one another. At times Maison Close resembles a sophisticated soap opera, but there is an insightful intelligence to it that usually lifts it well above lesser dramas. This series could have been so bad, but the quality of the acting, the sets, and sometimes the dialogue ended up with me giving the season 5 stars.<br /><br />It's distressing to watch how Rose (Jemima West) is forcibly inducted into the bordello; I imagine how this scenario could have happened given the circumstances in 1871, so I don't have any reason to doubt the portrayal by the screenwriters as anything but realistic for the period.<br /><br />While the adult nature of the premise ensures nudity, the sexual content here isn't more graphic than what is seen in a typical HBO drama. Speaking of HBO, Maison Close is on par with that level of programming (it aired on Canal+, a French premium cable TV channel).<br /><br />There isn't much room for humor in Maison Close, but they still manage to pull it off tastefully on random occasions. The most memorable example is a visiting Dr Lombardi who pokes and prods our heroines and then informs them of some conclusions from his research; the good doctor gets his just desserts after presenting his biased, half-baked findings.<br /><br />Overall, this first season of 8 episodes is a forbidding yet addictive show to delve into. Despite murder, mayhem, and the unfortunate exploitation of prostitution, Maison Close doesn't leave you in a pool of misery after indulging in it.h; the good doctor gets his just desserts after presenting his biased, half-baked findings.<br /><br />Overall, this first season of 8 episodes is a forbidding yet addictive show to delve into.

The case is certainly quieter than any case I've ever owned that wasn't touted as 'silent', however, true silent computing enthusiasts would not be impressed by the decibel output of this tower 'right out of the box.' Having said that, for the average consumer the case is certainly quiet enough.     Equipped with both standard fans, and an additional after market 'silent' 120mm fan I installed myself, the only sound discernible from the case when placed beneath my desk is an extremely faint hum. Upon moving the tower to my desktop the hum becomes a faintly pulsing white noise that waxes and wanes as the fans rotate. This humming white noise quickly fades into the background unless I expressly focus upon it.    The case has ample room inside to install most any component desired. Extremely tall after market CPU coolers may cause some difficulty, but by and large, clearance should only rarely be a cause for concern.    The P183 suffers from a few small annoyances. The case door swings open to the left - something almost, but not quite, rare enough to be called an oddity - and this can make it awkward to use for some people. The sole reason I make a note of this is because most people I know tend to place their towers to the right of their chairs, either on the floor or on their desk. The reason for this? Perhaps it is because most case doors tend to swing open to the right! This may be an arbitrary comment and may in fact actually be viewed as a positive by some purchasers so your mileage may vary. It took me a few weeks before I quit attempting to open the door in the wrong direction but that may say more about me than it does about the case.    The door, in addition to opening the 'wrong' way, also covers the power button when fully closed. Since the door comes with a lock, this could perhaps be viewed as a securityprecaution, however, there are holes in the door that allow one to bend a finger through and turn off the power without ever opening the door. Why cover the power button when the door is closed if it doesn't prevent anyone from accessing the button? In addition to this, most power supplies have a master power switch that is freely accessible on the back of the case so this button issue is purely a pointless annoyance and nothing else.    The Antec P183 also suffers from a few minor quality control issues. Behind the aforementioned door are a number of small filtered gates that cover the various bays in the case. These gates are designed to add an additional sound buffer and to collect particulate matter that may be sucked through them by the case's airflow. Whether the gates succeed at these two goals is difficult to determine, however, while I can not comment on their noise reduction and filtration I can comment on the build quality.     The very first thing that happened when I attempted to open one of these gates is that it broke away from the case and fell to the floor. Upon closer inspection these plastic gates are held in place by a fragile nub of plastic - considering the rest of the case feels so solidly designed, this fragility truly stood out in a negative light. Luckily, even though the gate has broken off, it can still be clicked in to place and, for the most part, it stays put unless someone attempts to open it.    All in all, this is a solid case. I wouldn't advise anyone pay the full MSRP but if found at $100 - $150 dollars I believe it is a purchase that contains a lot of value.",

According to the exFAT spec, exFAT should work with Vista as long as Service Pack 1 is installed. Neither of these cards did, however. Instead, there is a message stating the card must be formatted before it can be used. If I try to format it in Vista, NTFS, exFAT and FAT (not FAT32) are provided as options. It won't format the card using NTFS or exFAT and if you format it as FAT, the card only shows about 4 megabytes of memory rather than 64 GB.<br /><br />I rated this at 3 Stars since I don't have another Vista computer to experiment on.

I scanned the instructions, pressed home, selected Time magazine and a book, and had them in the machine in less than 20 seconds each.     Then I started reading them.  (While in the parking lot where I had picked it up moments before.)    First impressions:    1) My Kindle was preregistered and said \\\\\"Welcome Randy\\\\\" on an early screen, and was ready for me to buy stuff.    2) I own the Sony PRS-500 and 505, and the screen is the same quality, as well as page-turn speed. The buttons are very different and better...the turn page button is 5 inches long, the \\\\\"turn page back\\\\\" button is a half inch long. This makes much more sense than Sony's minimal equal-sized buttons.    3) The fonts are MUCH MORE PLEASING. Sony basically has one font and three sizes, this has much more and look better designed for this kind of screen (rounded serifs, etc)    4) It has a dictionary you can go to when you don't know a word (Sony doesn't).    5) Bestsellers are $9.95, compared to $16.95 Sony.    It's too new for me to go further, but I'm very surprised and impressed so far.    There is more white plastic (not puke-yellow like in the photos you've seen for a few months) around the screen than Sony has, and the Kindle is much thicker, but still lightweight. Yet holding it is easy, and the \\\\\"next page\\\\\" button being practically the whole right side of the book is ideal.    The wireless connectivity, the interaction with the internet on the screen, takes this out of Sony's reach.    I honestly didn't expect to be be buying books within minutes of opening the package, before I even got home from picking it up. WOW!    THIS DEVICE IS FOR AVID READERS ONLY...so much negative comes from non-readers that want it to play movies, tv, radio, audio books. This device is to replace text-oriented store-bought books...and not much more. So yes it sucks as an HD movie player. whatever! If you read constantly, want to aquire books from thin air on a whim, the Kindle is for you.    Add-on note: The size of the device (at its largest) is EXACTLY the size of an unopened DVD--that can't be a coincidence...all 3 dimensions.    UPDATE A MONTH LATER: I'm hooked on several blogs delivered several times a day (I wssn't a blog reader before). I'm reading MUCH more, carry this thing with me everywhere I go. I've found I'm a more adventurous reader...I try the free first chapters and am reading many more books I wouldn't have tried before.    I read a lot of criticism of this product by many that have never used it. So many of these negative 'reviews' seem to be based on such small concerns, its like hating a car for its hubcap design.    This thing has changed my life. I went from avid reader to voracious.    Adding the blog reading, and spending odd hours going to the web browser on a whim...I hope the $399 price doesn't stop someone from such an important device. Books popping into a device instantly, with FREE internet access...I haven't touched my Sony 500 and 505 readers since I got this thing.    (Yes, I still read 'normal' books, magazines, and newspapers--the Kindle is another option that has expanded my reading world)",

I almost passed on this because a few people mentioned that the keyboard is more \\\\\"laptop like\\\\\" and I have a desktop, and now that I have the keyboard, I say... What in the world are they thinking, it may not be big and bulky, but I'm telling you that it is absolutely PERFECT in EVERY way! There is nothing more that I could want from a keyboard! First of all, when it arrived, I was impressed with the packaging of this product by Logitech, wow, it made me feel like I was really getting the royal treatment just opening it up! Then I noticed how solid it is, and heavy for a keyboard, it isn't going anywhere, no sliding around on my desk that's for sure! I popped in the Disc in my computer tower and in seconds it was ready to go, I've never had an easier time setting up a keyboard and mouse before...By the way, I purchased the Logitech MX Revolution Wireless Mouse with this wired Keyboard, and the installation of that was just as easy. I almost purchased the Revolution Keyboard with the same mouse, but I work alot in the dark after my husband has gone to bed and I don't want to wake him, so I would have to say that the main reason I bought this keyboard is because it is illuminated perfectly, It has never been easier to work in the dark, each and every key on the board is lit up in white, not hard on the eyes at all, and the top row is mostly in orange. Since the light shines up through the letters and numbers on the keys, it is absolutely the easiest to read with no difficulty at all! It also irritates me when the white paint on the letters would start wearing off my previous keyboards, this isn't likely to happen on this keyboard because this one is done with a laser. Also, it IS EXTREMELY quiet, I have never had aquieter keyboard, which is also important because I was always irritating my husband with all the clickety clacking of the previous keyboards when he was trying to sleep. I am so glad that I just happened to stumble across this keyboard while studying up on countless keyboards, I didn't even know that Logitech put out an illuminated keyboard. I have spent more money on keyboards than I care to think about, but this one I believe I will have around for a good long time. It is very solidly constructed and even though I was very hesitant to purchase this one, I just told myself, I'll return it if I don't like it, but to my delight, I am so happy that I chose this one, I would not return this one if they offered me double the money to give it back...I am so glad that I took a chance on this one!",

            "input": "The primary purpose of this review is to point out that the wireless \\\\\"WDS with AP\\\\\" mode can be very useful if you have multiple DAP-2553's in your network.  I purchased my first two DAP-2553's over a year ago to reach from my den, where the internet connection is, to my living room, where the home theater is (35' thru 4-5 walls).  Being a noobie at this multiple router thing, I assumed that my only choice was to set the den DAP-2553 as the \\\\\"Access Point\\\\\" and the living room DAP-2553 as a \\\\\"Wireless Client\\\\\".  That worked on firmware 1.12 on 5GHz for over a year.<br /><br />Then I got an iPad 3 and the wireless coverage in the living room was totally unacceptable (AP was in den) . While searching for solutions, I discovered \\\\\"WDS with AP\\\\\" mode, which allows each DAP-2553 to function simultaneously as both a wireless client and an access point.  DOH!  I upgraded the firmware to 1.25, then set all three (I had added a third DAP-2553) to \\\\\"WDS with AP\\\\\" mode.  For this to work, you have to enter the MAC addresses of the other DAP-2553's.  The instructions are a little vague, but here's what worked for me.  DAP-2553 #1 is connected via ethernet to the internet (Trendnet 2.4GHz router) & to the den desktops & to the den printers. #2 and #3 are ethernet connected just to clients. I wanted #1 to talk Wi-Fi with #2 and #3, but there was no point in having #2 and #3 talk Wi-Fi directly with each other, so #1 contains the MAC addresses of #2 & #3; #2 contains the MAC address of #1; and #3 contains the MAC address of #1.  The MAC Addresses are entered in Basic Settings > Wireless after the Mode is set to \\\\\"WDS with AP\\\\\".<br /><br />I'm not sure whether WDS will work with a multi-vendor mixture of routers or even multi-model within the same vendor.  The D-Link FAQ seems a little outdated in this respect.  I have taken the conservative approach and stuck with a single vendor and a single model.<br /><br />I tried to set this up using built-in AP Array functionality, but couldn't get itwork (SCAN would never recognize #3 even though all 3 were ethernet connected during setup) and, anyway, I was left wondering whether AP Array was intended for the scenario where each unit had its own ethernet connection (poor documentation?).<br /><br />I discounted one star because of having only a single ethernet port; the difficulties with documentation and setup (sometimes I have to Save changes twice and sometimes update/reboot takes awhile); and my uncertainty about whether range would be better if I had purchased a different brand/model.<br /><br />My experience has been that once setup, the DAP-2553's work well.  Wireless speed in my living room is now satisfactory. I intend to get a fourth DAP-2553 to connect an additional Blu-Ray player in another bedroom. If I was not already invested in DAP-2553's I would check out some of the newer 450Mbps (and up) models (instead of 300Mbps).  My cursory look at the 450Mbps models indicates that they are even more expensive than the DAP-2553 and the one at which I looked closely does not appear to support anything similar to WDS with AP ([[ASIN:B006QB1RPY ASUS RT-N66U Dual-Band Wireless-N900 Gigabit Router]]).  But perhaps I haven't interpreted the specs or user manual correctly.",

I wanted to keep the main unit in my office and a scout downstairs in my husband's. But since we have separate land lines, this didn't work out. But that's the only problem we had--I bought an inexpensive $25 handset, hooked it up, and voila!    One concern with the VoIP systems is whether the companies that offer them will survive.

However, it is simply not able to become a paper replacement given that the included pen feels like writing with a tooth-pick.  So I was excited when I saw that a top-notch company like Wacom provides a more pen-like option.  Given its price (almost 10% of the tablet price), I was expecting a high quality pen.<br /><br />Unfortunately the stylus failed on two counts for me.  First, it was a lot lighter than I was expecting.  I was expecting a lot more heft similar to a nice roller-ball.  While it is nicer than a cheap ball-pen, it's closer to the weight of a uni-ball than a high-end pen.  Also, and this may be forced by the electronics inside, the weight has been placed mostly in the cap, so when you write with the cap at the back, it is rather end-heavy.  So while this was unfortunate, it is not the reason for the poor review.<br /><br />I have returned this pen simply because the off-set is intolerable.  It appears that the tablet reads the pen at the base of the tip which is about 1 mm from the end of the tip.  Given the years of writing and hence expectation that the ink will be where the pen meets the paper, this is extremely annoying and essentially unusable.  Perhaps someone with large handwriting may not notice, but for me it was not a useful replacement.  What is extremely disappointing is the fact that the free S-pen writes perfectly well.  The tablet picks it up and there is no off-set.  Unfortunately with its plasticky feel and lack of girth, it is not comfortable for long periods of time.<br /><br />On the positive, I love the idea of the rubber tip.  One of the other down-sides of writing on glass is that there is not the &#34;friction&#34; or &#34;scratching&#34; that one expects from paper.  The rubber tip to provide that extra grip is a great idea.  I would have used a softer rubber for more friction, but it is still better than hard plastic.<br /><br />One would have really thought that since Wacom provided the technology for the &#34;pen&#34; in this tablet, they of all people would have produced a really high quality pen.  Unfortunately this is not it.  Perhaps a later patch or upgrade might fix it, but for now my search continues.  I would hate for this tablet to be relegated to a nice iPad simply because no one can make a good pen.  If you do know of one, please mention it in the comments.",

This model is for NAS enclosures(RAID setups mostly but not required) and thus has a few features that the standard consumer drives to not have to make it more reliable and suitable for RAID configurations from simple(Raid 1) to more advanced(RAID 5,6,10,01,ZF2,etc.). It also has a warranty a year longer than consumer drives and can be furthered with 3rd party warranty(read fine print before doing so, so that you fully understand how it works.) All these factor in to why it is more expensive. The downside is that these are optimized to be media storage drives and to be in a RAID configuration to limit the bottleneck(limiting of performance) of a single drive. These drive spin around 5400RPM or less and thus arent the most speedy. If you do not need higher performance(their is a pro version of these drive that spin at 7200RPM) or will use a RAID configuration with striping across multiple disks, this is an excellent purchase.<br /><br />If I should have any problems I will update my review accordingly.",

I'm constantly lifting my fingers to check their position. The keyboard does have one cool thing about it though. It can light up for nighttime use. I found the touchpad easier to use on this laptop than on my Toshiba. Generally, I HAVE to have a mouse.<br /><br />It is a Windows 8 laptop and as a user of Windows back to when it was simply a GUI (Windows 3.0), I am still trying to get used to the idea of dealing with Windows as a smartphone-like operating system. I am not sure that I like it. It just seems unnecessary. For example, it has a Netflix button on the front page. You have to download an app to use it. Why would I do this when I can simply go online on this same laptop to stream from Netflix?<br /><br />The hardware is nice. Particularly the quiet keyboard and fast startup (partly due to the solid-state hard drive). The hard drive seems small - one of the tradeoffs of solid-state hard drives. The lack of an optical drive (DVD or CD) at first bothered me, but I rarely used it on my previous laptop. This laptop does not have a 15-pin VGA output, which could be a problem if you use projectors for presentations (particularly older projectors) at conferences, though it does have an HDMI output. There is a headphone jack, but no microphone input.<br /><br />Adobe Premiere Elements and Adobe Photoshop Elements are included, but you will need to purchase a key for the Office 2010 products installed, which might be the most difficult thing to swallow. This means no Microsoft Word. Prepare to purchase this if you're buying this laptop for a student. It does come with protection from Norton.

This is the first Logitech equipment that I've ever had so many problems with. In my home we have six keyboards altogether (some of them actively used, others on a shelf). Of our six keyboards, five of them are Logitech keyboards. As I type this review, I am using a Logitech keyboard, an \\\\\"old-fashioned\\\\\" corded keyboard with the keys in a straight line (with an \\\\\"old-fashioned\\\\\" Logitech corded mouse). **It works better than the keyboard that is the subject of this review.**    The initial, original, starting installation of the WAVE keyboard and accompanying mouse took HOURS! The software (\\\\\"Setpoint\\\\\") is probably very sophisticated (24 Megs? I should hope so!) but I'll never know for sure. I got it running and I could use the keyboard and the mouse, but the full installation of the latest revision of the Setpoint software was never accomplished.    So I tried to update the program. The Logitech website insisted on presenting their 64-bit update no matter how many times I checked off the 32-bit update choice. Then, clicking on the DOWNLOAD button on Logitech's site produced nothing. No response. Zero. Zip. Then I went to another download site (\\\\\"Hippo\\\\\") and downloaded the proper update. Then I attempted to install it and finally succeeded after several tries. Then I tried to run Setpoint. It refused to run, stating that an \\\\\"essential\\\\\" file \\\\\"khalwraper.dll\\\\\" was corrupted AND THEREFORE THE INSTALL COULD NOT CONTINUE. I did a search on the net and learned that  \\\\\"khalwraper.dll\\\\\" is a virus of some kind, affecting the registry. Then I used another program to clean my registry. Setpoint still wouldn't run, again making the statement that that  essential file \\\\\"khalwraper.dll\\\\\" was corrupted. Then I called customer service. I spent a lot of time in discussion, and I mentioned and named and slowly spelled out the letters of the offending file, \\\\\"khalwraper.dll.\\\\\" The technician instructed me to uninstall Setpoint, using the Windows Control Panel Option to do so. I did, and that is when I finally lost my patience! The uninstallation of Setpoint left me with no mouse at all! (Have you ever tried to run Windows without a mouse, using keyboard commands only...?) After a lot of wasted time, I managed to shut down the computer, pull out all the Logitech Wave components and replace those components with this old-fashioned, non-wireless, non-ergonomic dinosaur. This old dinosaur works, at least.    I packed up the Wave, returned it to Amazon for refund. Now I'll try to upgrade my dinosaur. Again.    Some words of warning about `ergonomic':  The word, \\\\\"ergonomic\\\\\" doesn't have a consistent meaning when used to describe keyboards, in my opinion. I found that the most common meaning of \\\\\"ergonomic\\\\\" in this context was a keyboard that was flat (that is, no *wave* in the height of the keys) but with a curve to the keys' layout, a convex curve from the typist's viewpoint.  The word, \\\\\"ergonomic keyboard\\\\\" sometimes excludes the so-called \\\\\"split\\\\\" keyboard in which the keyboard keys are separated into two non-curved halves, one for left hand, one for right hand. Sometimes these halves are on the same chassis, sometimes not. Be careful when choosing an \\\\\"ergonomic\\\\\" keyboard and/or mouse. What you need and what you actually buy may not \\\\\"match.\\\\\"    Some words of warning about wireless keyboards/mice:  If you wish to upgrade your keyboard and/or mouse, think carefully about what you want to change and why. If you use a desktop computer and only a desktop computer, think carefully about your need for wireless devices. How could using a wireless keyboard enhance your work on your desktop computer? Do you really need the freedom to move the keyboard all over the room? What's the point? On the other hand, a wireless mouse **might** be useful if your corded mouse gets its tail tangled in the paperwork or other debris on your desk.Think carefully! Maybe a corded keyboard with a cordless mouse is the answer. Don't go wireless unless you must! For those of you who use a laptop computer in a desktop environment, your needs are different. Think carefully.    Decide. And when you have, look around and buy **exactly** what you need, no less, and **no more.** If you can't find wireless devices which meet your needs, look harder! Corded devices are available! And, in the long run, I do recommend Logitech.",

Looks fantastic and everyone is always remarking how great it looks  ... if I take 2 minutes and give them a brief demo of the MAC their jaw drops. Do not think that I will ever go back to a Windows PC again ... once you have a MAC you don't want to go back!! Saved a few dollars ... plus no sales tax buying through Amazon.

Went to the manufacturers site and looked for Firmware and driver updates (which should be the very first to try when something isn't working proper) and to my amazement tech support is telling consumers that their USB Hubs do not need firmware updates. LOL, all high-tech electronic devices need firmware in order to function, and just like drivers and applications get updates, firmware is no different. So knowing that the device probably uses a standard design and is not proprietary I googled to see who makes the chipset, and within 5 mins I found the answer. After discovering that Via makes the HUB chipsets for USB 3.0 I made a visit to their site to instantly find a Downloads section with firmware for their USB 3.0 Hub controller, again 5 minutes tops and I found the new Firmware Upgrade Tool (dated March 2012) and Upgrade Instructions in a PDF. Five minutes or less later I am running Firmware version 9.50. These devices come with firmware 7.40 which is old and full of bugs. Only time will tell if the newer Firmware is solid or not but so far my drives have not once disappeared as they did on Firmware 7.40. Below are the screenshots of the successful before and after flashing steps I took on Windows 7 x64.    I now own two USB 3.0 Hubs a D-Link and now a Tripp-Lite and both are running firmware v9.50. By the way, the internals on these devices look damn near identical using the exact same logic and they both now function exactly the same. Yes, I opened them to make sure they had the VL810 chip, lol I'm a computer geek, what was I supposed to do? ;)    Before flash [...]  During flash [...]  After flash [...]    My Ventura Pro went from transfering a 1gb iso in 15 seconds to 11 seconds. That is roughly a 30% increase in performance. Also worthy of note, is the fact that the drive would disappear permanently after removing it from the computer until I did a restart. However after the new firmware update it now seems to function as a normal USB flash drive. I also updated my NEC/Renesas USB HOST Controller firmware and drivers from Station drivers as well.    Please people stop giving stuff bad reviews until you do a little research. No more than 15-20 minutes tops and I fixed the problems with the HUB myself...",

The screen is fantastic and the UI is as smooth as what I've come to expect from various iOS devices (iPhones and iPads), which are still the standard for me.  As many reviewers have pointed out, the rear facing buttons are a bit odd, and with the front-facing camera the only clue to orientation when you pick the HDX up, it was always a 50/50 shot as to whether I was pressing the power button or volume up when I wanted to turn it on.  Also, despite the pictures, it definitely seems designed to be used in landscape mode.<br /><br />In general, as a primarily iOS user, I had a difficult time making the transition to the Fire OS.  I tried to use the Kindle as much as possible for 2 weeks, but still found navigating the OS cumbersome, especially task switching.  This was compounded by the lack of even a single physical button on the front.  I also was not impressed with the Silk browser.  There were also fewer apps, and I had to repurchase some favorites (PleX).  There is also (obviously) no way to mirror the display to an AppleTV (this functionality is promised to be coming between the Fire and PS4, but I don't have or want a PS4).<br /><br />Finally, the main reason I got the HDX was to try Kindle FreeTime for my kids.  I signed up for FreeTime Unlimited, which unfortunately lives up to its name too literally: there was no way for me to filter what my kids could and could not access.  There are videos, apps and books that I'm ok with them being able to access, and some that I'm not.  While I could control the amount of time allotted to each activity, I could not control access to content.  This was a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />For the price, its a great device, especially if you are new to the tablet or mobile ecosystem.  However, if you're already part of the iOS world, I'd strongly consider an iPad mini with retina display.  Or, if you're currently living in Android land, the Nexus 7 is a no-brainer.",

I had a full system image of the W510 (there were no proprietary \\\\\"hidden\\\\\" partitions on this system, just a straight Windows install), restored it to the 850 PRO, the laptop booted without any issues, and everything looked fine. No errors in device manager, and it appeared as if it was a complete total clone of exactly what was on the EVO drive. However, all the USB ports on the left side of the laptop (one 2.0 and two 3.0) lost functionality. (Lenovo Thinkpad W510, Win 7 Pro 64 bit) I took out the 850 PRO, reinserted the 850 EVO, no problems -- all USB ports functioned perfectly. Took out the 850 EVO, put back in the 850 PRO -- no USB ports. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. (Device manager is showing a Code 10 error for all USB devices whenever a drive (flash or HDD) is inserted, but shows no error(s) otherwise when no USB devices are installed/inserted.)    This is insane. (And no...fortunately...I did NOT do the dreaded firmware update; Magician said I had the latest firmware already installed.) So I am at a loss here. It's the weekend and I can't call CS for some relief/RMA. I have 3 Samsung 850 EVO 500GB SSDs installed on my other laptops, and have never had any problem. I decided to \\\\\"upgrade\\\\\" to the PRO from the EVO and man...what a mistake.    UPDATE: I called Samsung CS and was told, in no uncertain terms, that this could not POSSIBLY be a hardware conflict with my Thinkpad W510 -- it HAD to be a software issue. So I took a Lenovo rescue disc, installed it so that everything was pristine/out of the box fresh, and for a little while the USB ports worked. Then they stopped working.    So...being the stubborn type of person that I am...I went to my Lenovo V570 laptop (that had a Crucial 500GB SSD) and used a Paragon system image backup and restored to the Pro 512. It worked. No problems. I then reformatted the 512 and used a OneKey system image backup. That worked. Then I reformatted the 512, went back to the W510 and tried two different types of system image backups -- same problem; it would boot up, everything looked okay (no errors or yellow warnings in Device Manager, Event Viewer was solid, etc.), but as soon as I plugged in any USB device it was a no go.    Therefore, I'm stumped. The drive works, yet it doesn't work. It works in the V570 but it doesn't work in the W510. I've had 3 different drives in my W510 and they all work -- but the Pro 512 will not. (In fact, there's a Samsung EVO 500 in there right now and it works fine.) Something's going on here. But rather than send this SSD back only to receive a \\\\\"refurbished\\\\\" drive (how in the world does a company \\\\\"refurbish\\\\\" a SSD anyway?) I'll use it in the V570 even though that was not my original intent. My original intent was to install the 512 in my W510 and give a friend of mine the EVO 500 for her Thinkpad T410. Now I'll give the relatively brand new Crucial 500GB SSD to my friend instead.    NOTE: Since this drive does work in one of my laptops I've upgraded the stars from 1 to 3.",

This sets up in 5 minutes, and is working with a temporary telephone number letting you try it out for 30 days to see. Never had a problem yet.  3. It must be inexpensive. Can you say $0 phone bill? Sure you pay up front, but look:  you save $40-$60 over typical local phone/long distance. I figure that my break even point is 4 months.  4. It must have cool features. Look, this ooma unit is way cool. Don't even think to compare to the average telephone company.  5. It must be a stable company. Okay, I'm no prophet whether this company will stay or not, but who is to say that ANY voip company will be around in 2-5 years. If you MUST have absolute certainty here, stay with the local phone company. But, consider that churn is a major detriment to phone companies especially when it is easy to change back. Read the reviews of happy customers, and think how this business plan is made for people to stay with them. Yes, money up front will not require constant recapturing of fickle customers  6.

            "input": "I am a professional website designer and amateur writer. I needed an alternative to my full-size laptop, something I could take with me nearly everywhere. My criteria were small size, light weight, long battery life, solid state storage (for ruggedness), and Linux (so that I was not tied in to an increasingly bloated and slow Windows upgrade path). I chose the Eee PC 901 after extensive research, and it is exactly what I wanted.    The screen is, naturally, small, but it is the crispest display I have ever seen; some pages are more readable on it than on my 19\\\\\" desktop monitor. I have little difficulty touch-typing on the keyboard, once I got used to the size and placement of some of the punctuation keys. It boots almost instantly, and loads software as fast if not faster than my desktop XP system. Its wireless connection is the most painless I have ever dealt with, though it does seem to have difficulty with low-strength signals: if the signal strength meter reads below 50% for an access point, you're probably not going to get a connection.    Aside from its expected professional use, it is so useful in a personal sense that I hate to have it out of reach. I can read e-books in bed. I can comparison shop from a bench in the mall. I can play Sudoku while I'm waiting for a haircut. I can stop in McDonald's for a cup of coffee and a quick check of Google Maps directions (many McD's now have public WiFi). I can check what that bright star is from my back yard. I can watch streaming movies in my easy chair. And I'm doing all of this on a computer that would fit into a big coat pocket or average-sized purse.    I'm very glad I got the Linux version and would recommend it to anyone without reservation, no matter what their current OS. It is FAST. For the average person who just clicks on their word processor or Web browser or whatever and gets to work, it's just as easy to use as Windows; for anyone who's comfortable shelling out to the Linux command line, the additionalpower is amazing. The update system works more smoothly than Windows Update ever has. The included software does just about everything most users will ever need, and then some: the StarOffice suite, Web browser (Firefox) and email (Thunderbird), a personal information manager, an instant messenger program compatible with most of the IM programs out there, and an extensive collection of learning, productivity, and game software. It integrates seamlessly into my LAN, and I have no difficulty using it to, for example, edit a document stored over on my primary desktop machine, or vise versa.    The Eee PC 901 isn't for everyone. If your eyes have difficulty reading small screens or your hands don't fit on small keyboards, this may not be your computer. Plugging in an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor will alleviate that problem, but that does kind of defeat the whole purpose of a netbook. The touchpad is a bit touchy, though some tweaking of settings and retraining of fingers helped a lot there (and I love the two-finger scrolling function).    You might need some extras. The onboard speakers are, in a word, pathetic; I recommend purchasing some battery-powered speakers, or just using a set of earbuds. Also, if you're not fond of touchpads, you'll want to add a pointing device of your preferred type; the three USB ports make this easy, without the need to carry a hub around with you. Plus, although Linux is amazingly efficient at disk usage and the 20 gig of SSD drive space will stretch a lot farther than it would on a Windows machine, you will probably want to pick up a SDHC card or two (I like the 8 gig ones) for spare data storage.    This is an amazing little computer, and I can't recommend it highly enough. My only regret is not buying it sooner.",

I moved to a new office and got a new computer with a shiny, gorgeous new monitor (the Dell Optiplex all in one 9000 model, 23 or 24\\\\\" inches with a flat bezel - or maybe it's no bezel, but it's completely flat across, no indentation where the screen is).  The florescent lights shine on my computer screen all the time, it's like having 3 large white shiny bars across my computer screen.  So I decided to go with this anti-glare screen protector to reduce the glare.<br /><br />First of all - you're paying $90 for a piece of flimsy plastic that you tape on your computer screen with the included sticky tabs.  There are two sides to this screen, one side is shiny and does absolutely nothing to reduce the glare.  The other side has a bit more of a matte finish and reduces glare by a small amount but not much.  The screen is still shiny where the lights shine on the monitor.<br /><br />Secondly - the tabs which are used to attach the film to the screen are flimsy pieces of hard tape.  They fall off, aren't very adhesive, and look awful and cheap.  If you touch the sticky part your finger print ends up on it.<br /><br />Thirdly - the screen gets DARK.  I have the screen on the highest brightness setting and it's grey.<br /><br />Also - the screen is blurry - text isn't as crisp as it is.  I can already feel my eyes starting to strain.<br /><br />I'm gonna try it for another week - if I don't get used to it it's going back.  I'm not pleased, especially given the price.",

In fact, on the day of the press conference announcing it, I kept refreshing the Amazon home page until I saw the Kindle announcement and could order one! I wasn't going to take the chance on it being sold out and having to wait for it.<br /><br />My Kindle arrived earlier than the estimated delivery date. That was cool! I charged it right away, but that didn't stop me from buying some books while it was charging. It took approximately 3 hrs and 15 minutes to charge completely...not bad. I haven't had to recharge it yet (it's been almost a week, and I've been using Whispernet a few times each day).<br /><br />Reading on the Kindle is wonderful. My eyes are much less tired, since I can adjust the print size AND it's not back lit like a computer screen. The five-way controller makes it easy to scroll and select things. I also purchased the Amazon black leather cover. It's very nice and makes the Kindle feel like a \\\\\"real\\\\\" book if you want to hold it that way. I've been folding the cover back, though. I do wish the leather cover came in red--I'd get one of those, too.<br /><br />Philosophically, let me just say that to me, the Kindle is still a book. It may not be paper and allow me to turn pages, and it lacks the \\\\\"artistry\\\\\" of covers, typeface, paper and ink BUT it feels like a book when I read it. I see the Kindle as a welcome addition to my library, but it's not going to replace it all. I will still buy \\\\\"real\\\\\" books because I just plain love them. And there are lots of books that aren't on the Kindle that I want to own, like collectible editions, craft books, art books, photography books, and anything heavy in graphics that are enhanced by a beautifully crafted tome.<br /><br />I am happy with my Kindle. It meets my expectations. And I don't think it is too expensive, when I compare it to my other electronics. The Kindle does a lot and the cost covers the Whispernet aspect which I am glad I don't have to pay for on a monthly basis. I give the Kindle four stars because mostly, I don't believe any gadget is perfect. But I will recommend it. Thanks, Amazon!am glad I don't have to pay for on a monthly basis.

Takes a long time to initialize when I reboot and not always stable, sometimes I can't even change my DPI, it just doesn't react... Sometimes initializes with highest DPI, mouse flies away and doesn't recover for some time...<br /><br />Mouse's firmware is horribly broken. Battery indicator is completely wrong for instance. This is a common made mistake across all the companies, they usually set the battery percentage on their devices based on the alkaline batteries, not the rechargable ones. A ni-mh battery is considered to be at full capacity while the voltage is above 1.3V but this mouse considers it to be at 2/3 capacity which is correct for 1.5v alkaline batteries. So after I take it from charge, it literally stays at 3/3 capacity for only 15 minutes, and goes on all the day with 2/3 capacity indicator. So inaccurate. Funny part is that Synapse shows accurate information about battery's percentage, while mouse is not.<br /><br />Setting up the sleep timer on Synapse has no effect on this mouse, because it doesn't work. It goes to sleep, and wakes up again after a few seconds even though it's staying idle... so sleep function is also broken, a complete nonsense.<br /><br />If I choose the option to turn off all LED on it when my screen is off, sometimes they never come back on when my screen comes on.<br /><br />Sometimes when it is waking up from sleep, battery indicator lighting goes completely dark while other parts shine. Or sometimes it does the same thing while just waiting idle. At least this doesn't affect how mouse operates.<br /><br />When I dock the mouse to charge it, under normal circumstances, its lights should be fading out and fading in (pulsing) in a nice smooth way that looks good at night, but this almost never works. Either lights go completely dark or completely on (bat. indicator is always on) At least it charges...<br /><br/>I've read much worse problems about this mouse's first revisions which are using the previous firmware actually. Those terrible DPI and lag issues are solved with the last firmware at least but other issues that I wrote here still exists and because most of the people doesn't care about these mostly \\\\\"cosmetic\\\\\" issues, they are usually not being mentioned anywhere else.<br /><br />Overall this crappy mouse sure as hell doesn't worth it's premium price.<br /><br />Why 2 stars but not 1? At least it's doing what it is supposed to... Tracking is smooth, has no problems and no lag at all.<br /><br />UPDATE 01-12-2014;<br /><br />Contacted Amazon and requested a replacement, hoping that my mouse was really a faulty one... Well, the replacement one was even worse. On top of all the same problems, it's tracking sensor wasn't even working properly and the palm rest area was loose, not tight as it should be. A complete trash. Just returned it and got a refund... Don't waste your money on this crap, buy a Deathadder or Logitech G400 and save your money.",

I am driving two computers at work and want to quickly switch back and forth between the two. Unfortunately the VP181 often seems to believe that the dormant computer is not providing any video signal and so when you try to toggle, it claims that there is no active signal and reverts to the original computer's input. Sort of frustrating. I have to jiggle the mouse of the dormant computer before toggling the VP, then it switches.<br />Also, while the switch interface on the base will not be a problem for the light user (who is driving only one computer), a single button to hit to switch both video and audio input from computer 1 to computer 2 would be nice.

I shall confess i thought i was kind of closing a big deal when i get this playbook for an unbeatable price in the market, but it turned to be just a bait. Where should I start? first, lack of applications. Lack of interesting applications, of course, playbook hosts plenty of insignificant, nonsense and useless applications, but not the interesting ones. No Skype. Not a single decent PDF reader. It has a powerful camera, but of no use without convenient applications. It's simply the same as nothing, i hold nothing in my hand. It is well built, yes, it got this classy feeling you perceive when holding something solid and well constructed. But lacks features so simple and common sense as, for example, a \\\\\"hold\\\\\" button to prevent the device from starting when cleaning the screen's surface. Result: annoying cleaning session. The charger lasted less than a month, i had to purchase another. The device now doesn't keep the WIFI settings when restarted, i have to insert EVERYTIME i restart it, the WIFI settings again. Wasn't like that at the beginning, but seems that aging has done bad to it. Visited hundreds of forums searching for answers, but nothing could solve the problem. Browser was great at the beginning, now is simply obsolete. No updates, and the worst thing of all, no hope. No hope for anything, for any improve, for any change.<br /><br />Simply unacceptable.

The things I'm sure you are worried about are picture quality and I'm happy to report that this is one of the best monitors I have used.

This monitor also comes with a 3 year warranty, which I have struggled to find monitors that cost more than this and are worse. It also looks nice, with it's curved base, nice silver lettering, and its glossy finish, it's a very pleasant thing to behold. And now comes my few niggles. The reason you're probably looking at this monitor in the first place was the integrated speakers, which, lets be honest, no one expected to be that great. They are okay, but they lack the punch of actual speakers from a stereo or headphones. I tried both the stereo and headphones option and found that the headphone jack has wiring issues causing a lack of audio for one of the ear cups or speakers. I fiddled with it and it eventually worked, but that really shouldn't be an issue out of the box. I haven't done further research into whether this is a widespread problem, but I am sure there are only a select few cases. My final issue, which is really more of a personal thing, is that while the glossy finish looks really good, it collects dust and shows it quite prominently.<br />I would say after all that, I would definitely buy this product and would recommend that everyone buys it. This product is really great with a few minor issues that are mostly just from personal experience. With its plethora of ports it's a highly versatile product that should be a great buy for anyone.",

So when I got the Note 8, I knew I needed a strong, protective case.  This does the trick.  It definitely protects my tablet.  For added protection, I can use the front cover, that doubles as a stand if I'm using it for movie watching, or when I need to follow a recipe in the kitchen.  Not only is it protected from dropping, but from food stains! It's not waterproof, but I don't plan on taking it swimming with me, just maybe the beach.  I also use it at the gym, on the bus and train, and don't worry about dropping it.  But with most OtterBox products, there is a flap that fits tightly over the headphone jack, and the charging jack.  It takes a bit to pull it back and push it in, so it should be sand proof.  The one minor flaw is that it weighs a ton, easily doubling the weight of the tablet, without the cover.  Add the cover and it's even heavier.  But added weight is nothing compared to having to buy a new tabled if I break this one.",

There was a tiny piece of clear tape on the PCI connector that I guess remained after I had removed the large protective tape wrap. USB 3.0 speeds are high and the card reader seems fast also. And it does read 16GB SD cards! I stayed with the VIA drivers 1.90a. There is also an updated driver available on the Uspeed.co website. (notice it is not .com)!<br /><br />The fact that it does not use up an internal motherboard USB 2.0 connector for the card reader function is a nice feature. The only interface is the PCI connector.<br /><br />I had sent an e-mail request for help to Lapmate and they responded within one business day offering to provide a new unit so I would have to rate the seller service as 5 stars also. Their contact info is here on AMAZON in the item listing.<br /><br />I would now give the unit 5 stars!<br />Jim D.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I bought this combination PCI TO USB3.0 CONVERTER with Card Reader as it seemed to have just the functionality I need. Delivery was quick, the unit appears well built and simple to install. The one I got has the PCI-E interface but no USB cable to motherboard as mentioned by some people here.<br /><br />Instruction sheet is a little hard to read but hey, what is there to connect but plugging in the PCI 1X connector, connecting, a molex power connector and putting in four screws....simple it seems at first.<br /><br />I installed it in a new LENOVO M81 desktop running Windows 7 Pro 64bit, i5-2500 processor with 8gb of memory.  Power on, the red light comes on, put in the install CD and after a short period I get an error message during the driver loading. The disk was in a plastic wrapper and does not seem to be scratched. Tried installing drivers several time but no success.<br /><br />Tried various usb 2.0 and 3.0 hard drives but even though I can hear the drives spin, nothing shows up in windows. Same with card reader trying 2GB and 6GB SD cards.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here I downloaded the VIA drivers 1.90a for chipset 800/801. These seemed to install but I get a message \\\\\"cannot find hardware....\\\\\" and the install fails.<br /><br />After a few hours of trying to get the thing going, I am not sure what to try next. Any ideas would be appreciated as I would like to keep the thing if I can get it working. Right now it is a one star but could be a 5 if I can get it working!<br /><br />Jim D",

            "input": "First off, I really do like these speakers.  Nice quality, compact design, stylish look.  Creative Labs makes decent quality products and this is a solid entry in their product line.<br /><br />Now for the reality part:<br /><br />Manufacturing something in white so it matches most iPods then slapping the name \\\\\"HD\\\\\" onto it doesn't make a product great or justify the seriously hefty price tag.  These are a decent set of Creative Labs speakers, not an outstanding set of Bose. And contrary to the name, there's no such thing as \\\\\"HD\\\\\" speakers, particularly in a 2.0 configuration.  There are surround sound speakers, THX certified speakers even Blu Ray True HD compatible speakers.  But in the end, they're all just speakers, based on the same tried and true technology that's been around since the advent of recorded sound; a cone inside the speaker vibrates to sound impulses.  That's it.  All the fancy monikers only denote an ability to interpret particular frequencies with varying degrees of clarity and devoid of distortion.  This is not the same as the evolution of standard TV to HiDef or DVD to Blu Ray.  Hence the term \\\\\"HD speakers\\\\\" is just silly and misleading.<br /><br />Sound quality:<br /><br />I like to listen to Native American music, and the surest way to tell average speakers from great ones is to play Native music and see if they can handle both the highs of a cedar flute, and the lows of a nice drum.  If they can do that, they can play anything.  The sound quality of these is crisp, with decent lows but they do struggle a little at the high end. I hooked them up to my laptop on their own at first, and the sound was just average.  Then I used a splitter to add a second set of speakers (also Creative Labs) and suddenly the depth and dynamic range was much improved.  Point being, these are just an ok set of 2.0 speakers on their own.<br /><br />Real world use:<br /><br />I'd say these are good if you want to hook up your iPod and listen to music in the kitchen while you cook, or hook them up to a laptop and get better sound than your tiny laptop speakers alone can deliver.  But there's no way these could come close to delivering the dynamic range of a quality stereo system.  And by \\\\\"quality\\\\\" I don't necessarily mean you have to spend a lot of money.<br /><br />The fact remains that sound quality is dependent on the speaker cone's ability to vibrate.  The larger the cone, the better the vibration, and the better the sound.  Very few compact speakers deliver good quality sound, and these are no different.  Particularly without a proper subwoofer.  It's just a fact of the science involved.  When was the last time you went to a concert or the movies and saw tiny speakers hanging on the wall?  Hence my beef with the term HD, it suggests something that isn't true and is merely an attempt to justify a hefty price on a product that doesn't merit it.<br /><br />Setup is easy and basic.  Plug them into the wall, then your music source, and you're set.  There is a connector cable between the two speakers themselves, which is only useful if one speaker blows out and needs to be replaced.  But at that point, I'd just replace them both.  And the connector for the two speakers is one of those pronged ones, similar to an S-Video cable.  Not fond of those since they tend to fall out easily.<br /><br />Bottom line - I guess I'm not giving a glowing review here even though I do like the speakers.  I guess I just feel they're too pricey and didn't buy into the HD thing.  Don't get me wrong, these are good for what they are.  Just not great when factoring in all the other variables.  Creative Labs themselves makes many others that are likely as good for less money.  But if you gotta have white to match your iPod, then this is the one for you.  As a final observation, they do look expensive, so at least that jibes.e you cook, or hook them up to a laptop and get better sound than your tiny laptop speakers alone can deliver.

The two issues I have had with most monitors in portrait mode is that they either seemed too tall, or not wide enough. This monitor solves both of those problems. The resolution of 1600x1200 means that you get a width of 1200 pixels in portrait mode which I find is wide enough. I have on occasion found 1080 to be too narrow, but rarely feel that way with these. I also feel that I can still \\\\\"see\\\\\" the whole screen on these. With a 22\\\\\" or 24\\\\\" monitor in portrait mode, I felt I needed to move my head to scan from top to bottom, because they were so tall. I have two workstation that I primarily use, each has a mix of these in portrait mode and 22\\\\\" or 24\\\\\" displays in landscape. I find that I typically use the portraits for email, browsing or anything involving text. I don't do much work with video or images, but I have never noticed a problem with the speed of these monitors. Nor have I noticed any problems with the colors or whites, that others have mentioned.<br />The other nice thing about these are the inputs. There is VGA, DVI, Composite Video and S-Video. You can even do PIP with the analog video signals. There is also a built in USB hub in you need it. The only thing I am not crazy about are the menu controls, but they are no worse that most other monitors out there, and they are real buttons, that don't seem to get accidentally hit.<br />Granted most of what I have said pertains more to the resolution of 1600x1200 than the quality of the image, but doing a quick search on Newegg of monitors with this resolution, shows that the rest of them are at least twice as expensive. If you are looking for a portrait monitor, I can't see a better deal out there.",

The biggest problem, which caused me to return the machine, was that I couldn't get wifi to work. The Eee was able to detect my wifi network, but when I told it to connect to it, I got \\\\\"No DHCPOFFERS received.\\\\\" If you try a google search on \\\\\"eee pc\\\\\" \\\\\"No DHCPOFFERS received\\\\\", you'll get a bunch of hits on Asus's forums, where lots and lots of users are reporting the same problem. I might expect some hassles on a machine where I installed the drivers myself, or where I installed the wifi card myself. But when I pay for a machine that's got a preinstalled OS and preinstalled wifi, I expect it to work. I called Asus's tech support, and they figured out that the machine was shipped with an RaLink wifi card, when it should have been Atheros. They told me it wasn't going to work, and my only option was to return the machine.    Other impressions:    I expected the screen to be small, the trackpad to be awkward, and the GUI to be unresponsive, and they were. This is a netbook, so that's what you expect.    Xandros, unlike any other Linux distribution I've ever used, requires you to click through various EULAs to use the software. There was a EULA when I did the initial boot, and a EULA to use Star Office. This is lame. Open-source software does have licenses associated with it (e.g., the GPL), but they're not end-user licenses, and there's no reason to make the end user click through them.    The default desktop is cluttered with useless junk like special icons to get to Wikipedia and Google Maps.    They seem to expect you to access certain functionality through cryptic key combinations like Fn-F1 (open a wireless connection) and Ctrl-Alt-T (open a terminal window). This is not so bad if there's some other way to do it, which was the case for the wireless connection, but didn't seem to be the case for theterminal window. It's fine if they want to show certain functionality less prominently because it's not of interest to all users, but there should still be some way to discover it through the GUI without having to do a Google search.",

I messaged the seller about this and he said he sent me the updated version of the tablet.This tablet has a great speaker, I was very surprised at the quality of the speaker, when I put it on full volume it's usually to loud. It also has a USB mini and HDMI mini port on it. The USB mini port lets you add a USB mini to USB cord and you can plug anything USB like a flash drive, mouse, keyboard, iPod, or anything else that plugs into a USB port and it lets you connect your tablet to your computer and share files. The HDMI mini port lets you plug your tablet into your TV so you can use your tablet on a bigger screen. This is helpful if you are watching a movie or you need a bigger screen. Another great feature is the micro USB port that comes built in, this lets you expand the storage of your tablet so you aren't limited to a certain size. If you get multiple micro SD cards you can have limitless expandability and if you get an sd adapter for the micro sd card you can use it in your camera and then view the pictures with your tablet. (The tablet comes with a free 4gb micro sd card so you already get double your storage.) The tablet also has a button that simulates a home button so if you click on the home button, it will close the app you are using. Another great thing about the tablet is its front facing camera, this cameras quality surprised me when I used it. Even though it doesn't have the most megapixels of other tablets out there, it still works great if you want to take pictures of yourself or if you want to video chat. Overall, this tablet is a steal for its price. It comes with some great free apps and it even has google play.

It is small and lightweight enough to tote around in my purse/carry-on, and has enough battery life to last throughout an entire flight.

The drive reads are still okay even though they are below the advertised specs, but the writes are abysmal at around 78MB/s. Thinking it was a glitch from the application, I tried the same benchmark on my already installed Intel SSD drive. To my surprise, the much older Intel SSD blew the Kingston drive away with both utilities and writes were always well above 300MB/s.<br /><br />I gave it the benefit of the doubt, so I went ahead and configured it as a cache drive with Intel's RST as I originally intended. I got the same 78MB/s writes not just with the bench tools, but also by writing from my main SSD to the newly configured array. What's actually truly sad is that the mechanical drive can actually write faster than that by itself, effectively defeating the purpose of the drive to be used as a cache device since it will be recording incompressible data such as multiple OTA TV shows (this is a Media Center PC).<br /><br />To add insult to the injury, I also have an issue with this SSD where the HDD light on the computer now remains ON at all times, combined with my disappointment this is now an irritant and complete eyesore. Removing the Kingston SSD resolves this, and I can put back the old SanDisk mSATA drive without causing this new issue.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am sorely disappointed with Kingston and I am going to have Amazon issue me a full refund. The advertised specs are a total joke using known gimmicks such as compressible data algorithms with ATTO to &#34;boost&#34; their numbers with the Sandforce chipsets and I should have known that these specs were too good to be true for an mSATA drive.

The graphics cable port was \\\\\"adapted\\\\\" to accept the MacBook's video cable. Overall, I wasn't impressed nor disappointed. I was just hoping for a better fitting screen. I am happy to say it arrived quickly and works great so far, but I feel that the build quality was subpar for a $97 screen. The screen was shipped in a nice, oversized box and was very well padded with about 10 feet of bubblewrap around it. I paid $65 for a replacement screen for my girlfriend's Toshiba that she decided to use to weigh herself, and that screen was a direct swap without any extra legnth cables or adapters. I feel like this screen has the build quality of a $50-$60 screen. Not $97. But it's not my money or my laptop. I just was the one to fix it, and it earned me a quick $100, and saved the customer over $500 if she would have had Apple replace the screen. I'm not saying it's a bad screen, I just want future buyers to know EXACTLY what they're getting.<br /><br />Cheers folks,<br /><br />Kevin",

It is worth noting that the Window experience user rate did not change at 7.9 (max for windows 7).<br />Now for the novice users, here are a few very basic explanations about Nvidia video cards:<br />- 970 stands for:<br />9 is the release version<br />70 is the performance level<br />This means that a Geforce 690 will be outperforming a 970 in pure performance. (check the prices and you'll see how expensive it is still).<br />- You should pay attention to the amount of RAM your card will have as some games are very demanding in that level. I mention games because these cards are mostly for gamers. Unless you process lots of pictures or videos, a much cheaper card will be enough if you do not play the latest games.<br />- Your choice of card should be depending on your video resolution. If you are using a 720p, that card may be too good for your needs. For a long time, I was using a projector with 720p definition and my games would run smoothly with a 3-4 years old card.<br /><br />In comparison with the 660Ti, I can say that:<br />- This card has twice the performance stats with FutureMark of the 660Ti. It may not translate into twice the amount of FPS but it definitely shows some improvements.<br />- It is much more silent than the 660Ti which could get fairly noisy at times. In comparison, I never hear the fans for this one.<br />- It has a better temperature control.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am fully satisfied.",

Two things I hope will improve:  -- ability to organize my library in folders, instead of looking at one huge list and scrolling up and down.  -- PDFs: ability to annotate PDFs, to increase font size, and to do word searches in PDF docs.    Otherwise, great product. I went to bed at 3 am my first night because I couldn't put down the book I was reading.",

This still seems to be the available SSD of this size in mSATA format (Samsung makes one but will not sell it direct to consumers).  Note: I understand SSDs at great depth - I previously contracted with 3 SSD manufacturers to write Windows Storport drivers for them (and a BIOS bootrom for one).  SSDs begin to suffer from accelerated flash wear and slower performance (dropping response time by 20x is serious) when they are kept too full (even though the manufacturers over-provision somewhat).  The SSD flash manager then has to move things around to get free pages, with excessive erases and the SSD slows horribly (a page of MLC flash has about ~5K erases before it starts to fail).  The rule is to never allow your SSD to be more than 50% full (Dell marketing does not understand SSDs and does not provide for an SSD of this capacity in their Ultrabooks).",

The more they sell of their inferior products, the less their return percentage will rear its' ugly head. There is a reason why a biostar motherboard, for instance, costs 20.00 more. The components (caps, solder, pwm, I/o board, components, etc) are intended to last longer than the provided warranty period, albeit not more than 4-5 years on I/o boards made today.<br />The worst aspect of the ECS sales model is their rebate processes. Most companies outsource their rebates to a third party to process for them. ECS has partnered with a  company called VELOCITY FULFILLMENT, INC. Needless to say, rebates are NOT getting processed. Very soon, in fact, we may see a class action suit gathering steam against both of these entities.<br /><br />ECS DOES NOT HONOR ITS' REBATE PROMISES.<br />What they do very well is pass the buck to their third party (like Velocity Fulfillment) for rebate fulfillment<br />In the end, no one seems to be responsible and the customer gets hurt.<br /><br />There is enough precedence in our legal system to remind these retailers they will be held responsible when the shoe drops. The rebates, after all, are advertised on websites like amazon and new*gg and is a compelling force in making a purchasing decision for many of us. The responsibility lay squarely on all three (seller who took your money, mfg. who made the product and offered the rebate via the seller, and the fulfillment company that stands to gain from not processing your rebate).<br /><br />AMAZON, you have a great reputation amongst online shoppers.

I am very uncertain why the program did not recognize my serial number, because I spoke clearly and do not have an accent.

I like the color and it came with a matching colored keyboard skin which fits well! I was very happy with my purchase...<br />BUT there are very noticeable scratches on the cover. I am very thorough when checking products over. When I saw the small scratches I was disappointed but when I saw that one big scratch on that top cover my heart broke. The small scratches I guess I could have lived with but that really big one on that top cover is too noticeable. When I showed people the cover, they can easily point out the scratch without me showing them. They had packaged and delivered it with what looked like a lot of care, so I'm not sure how the scratch got there.<br /><br />Keyboard Skin 5/5:  The skin has their logo on the space bar. It fits fine and has a great matching color. It was free and works well, it's fantastic. The quality was the same as another skin I bought.<br /><br />Case Color & Functionality  5/5: Despite what other reviewers said, I thought the color was more vibrant than on the picture, but it is fine for me. If you're looking to protect your cover from scratches and still be lightweight, it's perfect. The back feet make it great for movies!<br /><br />The Case 1/5:This case would've had a 5/5 if it wasn't for the scratches. I bought the case to protect it from damage, yes, but I did not want scratches already on it.<br /><br />Satisfactory Level 2/5: Everything was fine up until I saw those marks. If it was on the bottom it would've been alright.<br /><br />Overall Rating 3/5: It would have been a 5/5 if not for the scratches on top.

It just works.<br /><br />The GUI on this router the best I have had to deal with.  Without referencing install documentation I had the router hard wired to my primary computer, a secured primary wireless network (802.11ac!), a secondary network, and a guest network in under 15 minutes. There is a great feature called &#34;Smart Connect&#34; which allows one SSID to be broadcast for multiple radios. The NETGEAR genie user interface made it easy to find the appropriate settings and know which setting I should choose.  An intuitive UI is something that other manufacturers I've dealt with just haven't been able to accomplish as successfully. The parental controls available appear to offer all functionality I would ever need - if I was in a situation that it was necessary.  Logs and other settings provide all the information I could want.<br /><br />All of my devices connected flawlessly.  Sustained wireless speeds are a bit higher than before but the main benefit has been NO MORE DROPPED CONNECTIONS!  My devices all stay at full bars throughout my house and only drop down to 4 when I go outside on the opposite end of the house (where I previously had spotty reception).

Didn't mind the color around the edge that some people don't like, I didn't notice it once I focused on the screen.  Very happy until I closed the case.  You could see the light stayed on for a long, long time.  It finally slept so I opened the cover up to see what would happen and it didn't wake up!  I tried this multiple times with no success.  Since that was the feature that convinced me to purchase this, I am giving it one star and sending it back. It was very difficult to get it out of the case which wouldn't be bad unless you are trying to send the case back.",

With this one, however, everything lines up perfectly.  All the holes are centered where they're supposed to be and allow for total and easy access to what you need to access; even the hole for the BlackBerry logo is perfectly centered.  It's a very snug fit that doesn't allow your PlayBook to jostle around inside the cover.  It will no doubt keep it looking new for years (or months, the way technology goes) to come.    My only complaint with this cover is that I'm sure I will have to remove it every night to use the charging pod I just ordered.  That isn't a knock against this cover, as no case or cover currently available is going to work with the charging pod.  My only other complaint is with the stylus.  It's not very good at all.  The screen has to be PRISTINE in order for the stylus to work even moderately.  It's much easier and faster to just use a finger as intended.  One nifty feature about the stylus, though, is that it has a handy little pin inside that can be used to do a hard reset of the PlayBook if necessary.  Just screw the clip end off, and voila'!    In a nutshell, this isn't the prettiest cover out there.  In my opinion, it kind of cheapens the look of the PlayBook itself with it's random-looking shiny pieces, but I challenge you to find one that has a better fit.  Add a screen protector and your PlayBook will be very cozy and protected from most any bumps and scrapes.  I would venture to say this cover will even provide some protection against impacts from a short fall to a hard surface; excepting the screen, of course.  Aesthetics aside, you will not be disappointed with your purchase if functionality as designed is your main concern.",

My problem was always having my phone with a very low battery by the end of each day. I use my phone frequently during a day for phone calls, texting, checking email and I am always on the go. BlinkOne PowerBank came with Micro USB cable and user manual. This stylish, light, durable, powerful and portable charger saves me everyday that I love it even more! It is very simple to use that even a caveman can do it. BlinkOne powerbank has dual USB which lets me charge multiple devices at the same time. I just connect my device to either USB port on the front and press a power button. That's all I have to do to start a charge. I don't ever have to worry about overcharging my handheld devices because once they are fully charged, powerbank will auto shut off. It can supply power to any handheld device. I use it on my Iphone 4S, Ipad, and camera. They charge fast as if they were plugged into an outlet. In addition to everything, it has built-in 4 bar indicatior showing power usage level. It even has a strong LED flash light as a Bonus. It really helps me to find my way around when it is dark. I wish I had this mini powerbank earlier when I was stuck in the middle of nowhere with my phone dead. This is a reason #1 to have this perfect for all occasions multipurpose device because in case of emergency it will HELP. BlinkOne is the most affordable compared to other powerbanks out there and I know it will last for a very long time because it is backed by BlinkOne Lifetime Warrenty. I am going to buy it as a gift for my family members these holidays!!!",

I dared not try to plug in the car charger to see if that fit.

Now, there are two things about power supplies, one, they rarely fail, and two, when they fail it's probably because they were overloaded.  I knew that Antec had a good reputation for power supplies (along with Corsair, PC Power and Cooling, and some others), so I included it in my search for a replacement.      One thing I found out was that Antec has by far the best website among power supply companies.  Good or bad, I knew exactly what I was getting, including how many cables the unit had, of what type, etc.  Without this information, it's very difficult to buy a power supply.      The Antec power supply is somewhat \\\\\"modular\\\\\" in that it has a few cables (four) which can be plugged in to the power supply or left uninstalled, as needed.  I installed only one of these cables, and that one only to power the cooling system.  Thus, by far the majority of cables are permanently attached to the power supply, making it less modular than one might believe.  Some information suggests that modularity (in the form of plug-in cables) is not a good idea anyway, because of the added electrical resistance, but it does keep your installation somewhat cleaner.      I should mention that all the wires are grouped into connector groups and bound together with mesh cable protectors, a system I found much easier to deal with than tie-wrapped wires.  I used only a couple of large removable wraps to keep the cables in place: the manufacturer's cable protectors did everything else.      It's difficult to be satisfied or not with a power supply until several years have passed.  I am satisfied for the present, but if this unit fails in less than five years, I will probably try another make.",

I used the EasyTransfer and it worked great. IIRC, the 'fat end' goes into the NEW computer, and the other end into the old one. I may have that backwards - try it both ways until you see both computers' stuff on the new computer. The directions kinda suck, but the tool is pretty self-explanatory.<br /><br />Anyway, it transferred over files, basic preferences (desktop background etc), emails, and basic email settings (from OE to Mail), and also Internet Explorer favorites. Note that it will NOT transfer passwords that you've told IE to 'remember\\\\\" (a good thing in my book, for security). My parents had a little shell shock with this since they are bad about writing down that stuff and also bad about updating new email addresses to get the info - but that's a different story.<br /><br />I haven't used this on my Mac, but I'm sure it would work fine. So final analysis - for someone who has a TON of stuff on a computer and no external hard drive to move it to, and who cannot/does not want to network the computers wirelessly, this is a good solution. I still wouldn't pay more than say $20 or so for it though, since likely it'll only be used when you get a new computer, and anyone with some knowhow could easily network or move things in another way.

Of course the bear motion one can't do those fancy things but at about 1/3 the cost this one protects the ipad as well and is of similar quality so I'm very satisfied.<br /><br />The outer cloth bag and the fact that the logo is only on that cloth bag but not on the folio is also a plus.",

It is a kind of tiring, because you will feel a much greater hand crank resistance compared to cranking to charge the flashlight's internal battery! BTW, instead of manually charging the internal battery, you can also connect the flashlight via the included USB cable to a computer's USB port, and in about 12 hours, it would be fully charged. Remember to move the switch to USB In when you do this. A fully charged flashlight will NOT charge your iPod or cell phone via the USB Out port, you must use the hand crank!

The 3G data modem does a great job in both the US and internationally.      The software is good at what it is designed to do, although there could be some improvements to the intuitiveness of the software.  My biggest beef that prevents me to recommending the Kindle to other buyers is the lack of compatibility with, what has become \\\\\"industry standard\\\\\" electronic book formats.  The lack of compatibility with Adobe\u00ae EPUB & PDF eBooks makes it incompatible with the formats, for example, most libraries use to lend books.     Thus, Amazon has done a pretty good job of adopting the \\\\\"Walled garden\\\\\" format that Apple has had great success with.

Turns out they had a temp-driver who was new, and he had a package with a smeared tracking number, so he called dispatch, and they thought it was MY package, so gave him MY tracking number and it was delivered, but to the wrong person at another address, and it wasnt even MY package!<br /><br />...The dispatch-manager called me the next day to explain this, but that call started badly as he also called me by a wrong name! I was starting to lose faith in the system by this point!...DAMN! He then told me they thought they knew where MY package might be, and it would be delivered the next day....( I have heard this line several times before by this point! )....<br /><br />...I am leaving out several more phone calls and conflicting stories, but it was Finally delivered late the next day, but the frosting on the cake was the poor driver came in and called me by the wrong name as well! ( So now I have a new name with all the guys at work, too! )....Thanks, Fed-Ex!<br /><br />...It actually took 10 DAYS to get this package to me! Unbelievable! I know Fed-Ex delivers millions of packages every day all around the world, but this one was a very noteable exception! I ordered each component of this new PC online, and ALL the rest were delivered by UPS with out a single failure or delay. In fact, one order I placed at 6:35PM, and it arrived by 10:30AM the Next morning, without my requesting it be overnighted! (?)...No idea how, but that aint a complaint, folks!<br /><br />...Big corporations like Fed-Ex normally work highly efficiently; just like the freeways here in SoCal, but when a problem occurs, it is friggin Amazing!<br /><br />...I can look back on it now and smile, but it was pure Hell when I was going thru it! I am sure each of you reading this have similar horror stories about some company or another, so I am chalkingthis up as the tiny abberation in a usually excellent company's performance, but had to vent about it anyway....<br /><br />...Now, I just have to get used to my new name!...LOL!.........",

I took a look at this mouse, looked very snazzy, and the design seemed rather ergonomic.

If you're a FPS gamer, you'll realize that when you move your mouse, you often times lift the mouse up and reposition and move the mouse again.  This wasn't made for that.  There is a groove for the thumb but the groove on the right side seems to have been made for the ring finger, but feels more comfortable placing my pinkie finger there.  <br />And because of that oddly placed groove on the right side, I'm constantly struggling to find a good position to lay my hands on.  I've been on the recieving end of someone's muzzle many times because I was preoccupied with trying to find comfort.<br />For basic window navigation and web surfing, it's okay.  The back page button is real handy, and the autoscroll down button (right below the wheel) saves me the hassle of constantly scrolling the wheel.  However, the forward page button and autoscroll up button is placed in an awkward position, requiring you to reposition your hand just to reach those two.<br />Not a horrible purchase by far.  Haven't had trouble...yet.<br />edit - 3 June 2004:<br />I just noticed this.  Try this the next time you're in a store with a display model of Mx 510.  Flip the mouse around so the buttons are pointing at your direction.  Now, put your LEFT hand on the mouse.  REAL comfortable, aren't they?  The thumb groove is not crampy, and the pinkie and ring finger now has a VERY comfortable spot!<br />Did logitech put the grooves on backwards?!  My goodness!",

There are two parts to this product, the actual physical tablet and the software included. The tablet allows using a pen that has the functionality of a mouse and more, including right and left click buttons. Handling the pen is a little awkward at first, especially because the starting point of the pen on the tablet alters the initial positioning of the cursor on the screen. This definitely makes sense, since it is necessary for being able to draw on the tablet using a set point of reference, but if you are using the pen for normal mouse functions, it takes a while to get used to. The mouse provided has the typical functionalities of a wireless mouse and does not provide any benefits beyond this. There are also customizable buttons on the tablet, similar to the hot keys you have on your keyboard for browsing the web, accessing your email, etc. One in particular allows for zooming in and out, which is very handy when working on pictures trying to perfect them.<br /><br />The software provided with the product is pretty advanced too, and maybe this should have given me a hint regarding how user friendly the product was for novices. Corel allows creating artwork and has a variety of tools at your disposal. This is where I found the pen to be most useful, and I even tried creating handwritten notes, being reasonably successful. Photoshop provides tools to improve your digital photos and alter them in creative ways. My experience with this software is limited, so I had a hard time extracting serious benefits from using the tablet in this environment. I can see though, how professionals or serious users would benefit from using the pen and tablet to alter pictures. In my case, I could see the usefulness of Photoshop, especially with the nik Color Efex add on, but I did not understand how to incorporate the tablet usage in this process.<br /><br />The installation of the drivers for the hardware and the software suite was straightforward and even though it took a few minutes, it was completely hassle free. I think Bamboo could definitely improve their User Guide with further ideas on how to use the tools in combination with the tablet. Overall, I believe that advanced users will find this peripheral very useful, but the rest of us are likely to be overwhelmed by its complexity.nstallation of the drivers for the hardware and the software suite was straightforward and even though it took a few minutes, it was completely hassle free.

The product is complex, requiring support either from its vendor (good luck) or from the three companies involved Microsoft, Ceton and Comcast. Ceton only offers voice support at $99/hr/ They also offer \\\\\"free\\\\\" email support limited to part of each day and with all the limitations of any email system.  They do not even offer chat!<br /><br />However, after a loot of complaining here, rep did contact me and she was terrific.<br /><br />Here is the story:<br /><br />To even get started you need to go to a local Comcast store to get a cable card.  We did that .. an 1 1/2  hr trip.<br /><br />I tried doing the install and kept getting error messages. Ceton's email service blamed these on MS.  When I could get NO further help from Ceton with installing THEIR software, I packed my hardware and took it into a local Microsoft store.<br /><br />The MS store was great.  The issue was not MS or even Ceton.  The issue was incompatibility problems between Ceton's software upgrades and MS' Media Center upgrades. MS got the software installed BUT they do not have a Comcast cable.<br /><br />Give MS three stars for their support.<br /><br />I went home and tried connecting with Comcast.  As far as they can tell their system was working and they have exchanged data with the cable card.  BUt ... they had to send a tech out.<br />Comcast did all they could over the phone.<br /><br />Comcast warned me I would have to pay $200 if the fault was in the Ceton device or SW.  Lucky for me the fault was in the way the cablecard was set up and Moses .. a great Comcastr tech... fixed it.<br /><br />Now it works and it is very nifty .. EXCEPT it works through MS Media Center.  So far I have not found a good intro to using Media Center ... this appears to be something folks at MS consider \\\\\"intuitive\\\\\"  Maybe it is but then I must not be.  Online instructions for setting up Media Center involve very long settings within the program and the interface lacks the usual MS niceties like a help system.<br /><br />Bottom line, after several days effort I am using the thing and like it a great deal.  Not sure how to balance the ordeal of the install and lack of tech support with the product itself.",

In the future, when I need a new protector, I will go for the shiny finished ones, because the \\\\\"sharpness\\\\\" of the picture is much better than with the matte protector.

The main gripe I have with the one from Acase is that it did not fold flat which made thumb typing and gaming a challenge.  I received confirmation from other reviewers that this case did fold flat.  Here are my thoughts on this product.<br /><br />Although I knew this ahead of time from previous experience, I give HHI credit for including a small instruction sheet showing how to insert the tablet into the case.  While this case does fold flat (satisfying my stated requirement), it seems a little flimsy.  The notch for the most upright stand position creates an undesired hinge in the case making it unstable on any surface that is less than completely flat.  When I use the tablet in the case with my Bluetooth keyboard, it hangs a half inch or so off the end of my lapdesk.  It makes me uneasy where I never even noticed this with the Acase case.  It also requires a little extra force to close the case, and I can see this cause a show of wear over time.  Finally, don't be lured in by the inclusion of a free stylus.  It is a joke, and the one that came with mine broke during shipping.  The loop on the case is unlikely to hold a real stylus as my Belkin one is about twice the diameter of the loop.<br /><br />In the end, I cannot recommend this case.  While I like that it folds flat, its overall build quality is suspect.  I would defer to the Acase for now, but like U2, \\\\\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for.\\\\\"",

Within a week the same problems that appeared with the original have started with the replacement unit. I use the unit in an Amazon leather carrying case with elastic closing strap. That case makes the unit very convenient to use. The problem is that the unit spontaneously locks up with no prior warning. Typically, I put the unit in the \\\\\"sleep\\\\\" mode between uses. It can be a matter of hours or several days, and the unit will not reactivate. When that happens, holding the on/off switch sometimes reboots the unit, sometimes shuts the unit off and sometimes does nothing. The only sure way or restarting the unit is to plug it into the AC charging adapter. When the unit revives it is on the \\\\\"home\\\\\" page, and fortunately, I can return to the last page read by clicking on the book title. Each time the unit freezes, however, the clock must be reset.  This behavior was an irritation recently when I wanted to read on a plane flight and could not. I revived the unit at an airport gate charging station between flights.  Were it not for other features that I like about the Kindle, I'd rate it one or two stars. Those other features include the downloading convenience, ease of note making, and the pick up where you left off feature. Also, a favorite feature is the text resizing and orientation control. And, I like the synch capability with my desk top and laptop PCs. The non-reflective screen readability is great. The search feature and bookmarking are awkward, but no worse than my wife's color Nook. And, you can't easily flip through pages and then go back to where you were reading. Also, viewing maps and any kind of illustrations is dreadful. There simply isn't enough image/pixel detail to zoom in. I find the Nook no better on these issues. But, at least she has never had the lock up problems. While Amazon has started to put actual book page numbers along with their mysterious location numbers, the lack of page numbers with some books is an irritant. I didn't buy the Kindle for the purpose of having a quasi tablet. I bought it to reduce the accumulation of dead timber media in our house and for ease of use in travel. I don't have to lug half a dozen books for pleasure reading. And, despite the Kindle's limitations with PDF files, I can access my camera and other techie manuals on the Kindle.  So, as with all electronic devices, make a realistic assessment of your needs. And, scope out the serious user reviews.

I do not know whether the problem is in the adapter, or in the software supplied, but the crash would always come \\\\\"blue screen with memory dump\\\\\" when I put the adapter on the computer, and the software was not able to be deleted with the Windows software from the Control panel.

I listen to them at my friend's house all the time and I've never been disappointed. They're fine for pretty much any genre. From my experiences with them, I've never heard any rattling from the subwoofer (which some people claim). That would be caused by blasting and overloading the speakers (which many people do without realizing it). Also, make sure the equalizer for an iPod, laptop, or CD player is turned off. That will cause a powerful car-woofer bass which overloads speakers (which could cause rattling) and really irritates me! Make sure you don't bang them around which might also be the cause of rattling due to damage. Overall, I'd highly recommend these.

The product is well made and is sturdy enough for kids.  Installs quickly and all applications recognize it as input device and use it.     I have two big negatives on this product though:    First of all the pen is too big for a small kid to use.   Well, it is kind of big for even me and I do not have small fingers.   A thinner pen would have been nice.    Secondly, and the worst feature is that the tablet, once plugged in, represents the   entire visible screen of the computer. That is, if you touch any part of the tablet  with the stylus, the cursor jumps there. If you are drawing on a MS Paint page, for example,  when you want to draw at the corner of the sheet, you end up being at the corner of the tablet as well.   This is very non-intutive and very very annoying feature, especially for people who have been using  mouse most of the time. When I have to leave the drawing area and go to a menu item in the application,  it takes quite a guess to get there because I can not drag the cursor the way I do with a mouse.   With a mouse, if I am at a corner, I can lift the mouse from the pad, move it to middle of the pad and  then use it and the cursor continues from where it was left earlier. With this tablet, it is not so.  The cursor follows the pen throughout the pad. A \\\\\"Mouse emulation\\\\\" mode would have made it lot easier to  use.     Also the button on the pen is somewhat hard to use while drawing fine features. A switch at the tip of  the stylus would have been better.

However, if your main goal is pleasing, balanced sound in a compact package, look no further than the Bose Companion 2. Audio quality is stunning for a package so small. Highs are crisp/clean, and bass is commendably decent--surprisingly so, when you consider the tiny modules that are reproducing this bass--but it's what I was expecting from Bose before turning these on for the first time.     This system won't shatter the house frame, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, a speaker system that I purchased last night by a well-know manufacturer, complete with a monstrous subwoofer, is being returned tomorrow. I honestly prefer the sound of this diminutive Bose system--and as icing on the cake, it includes a spare set of input jacks for connecting another audio device, as well as a headphone jack.    Marvelous sound, attractive design, and an excellent value. I'm very happy.    1/9/2005: Brief addendum--one month after the purchase, I'm still very pleased with these speakers. They're a worthy replacement for the Boston Acoustics BA-735 speakers that have served me well for several years...and a bit of computer space has been reclaimed in the bargain, since the Bose speakers don't utilize a subwoofer, which I haven't missed in the least...I'm still in awe that speakers this small can reproduce such big sound.    I rarely comment on another review, but I couldn't help but notice a blanket condemnation of these speakers from a self-appointed \\\\\"expert.\\\\\" In checking that individual's other \\\\\"reviews\\\\\" at Amazon, I was struck by the number of Bose products that this person goes out of his way to trash...a disgruntled former Bose employee, perhaps?    The term \\\\\"cheap electronics\\\\\" was used by this \\\\\"reviewer.\\\\\" Of three speaker systems that I tried before settling on the Bose (one from Aletc Lansing, which was a nice unit otherwise, and one that was distributed under the Compaq name), this was the ***only*** one of the three that didn't sporadically pick up some type of amateur radio interference...Bose is doing something right that two other manufacturers couldn't manage.    Try the speakers for yourself. Unless boombox bass levels are desired, I think you'll be pleased. This was my first Bose purchase, and it won't be my last.",

They aren't computer savvy, nor do they do a lot with their existing computers, so I thought this was the perfect solution for them.  I really wanted to get the Core i5 or i7 version, but I couldn't wait any longer because I'm flying out to meet them.  I'm not looking forward to explaining these devices to TSA.<br /><br />I bought 2 NUCs, both with the exact same hardware:<br />- Crucial m4 256GB mSATA<br />- Crucial 16GB (2 x 8G)<br />- Belkin 6ft AC cord<br />- AmazonBasics 2-Pack, High-Speed HDMI Cables<br /><br />My total cost was $1109 for both, including the NUCs, or about $555 / NUC.  The 256GB and 16GB is overkill for my parents...but I bought the components as if I was building for myself.  Plus, I'm hoping these will last them 5-10 years.<br /><br />The initial install was very easy.  It took about 10 minutes to unscrew, install the components, and screw the chassis back together again.  Maybe less.<br /><br />Installation of Windows 7 was super quick too.  It only took between 5-10 minutes from a flash drive.  The updates, however, took about 2 hours (still very quick compared to HDD), and the NUC got very warm to the touch.  It also got audibly louder, but not annoying or \\\\\"very loud\\\\\".<br /><br />So, here's what I noticed:<br />- I didn't appreciate that I had to buy an AC cord.  I'd rather have a cord than the gimmicky Intel sound when you open the box.<br />- The NUC had an old BIOS version, so I updated it.<br />- The fan control in the BIOS was set to CUSTOM.  I set it to BALANCED, which lowered the CPU temperature threshold before the fan went faster, by a few degrees C.  I was surprised that the threshold was set so high, something like 77C.<br />- On bootup, the fan rotates at ~3K RPM, which I thought was very high, since I'm used to 600-1200 RPMs.  But then, these are tinyfans, so I guess that's normal.<br />- I also told BIOS to use the maximum amount of RAM it wanted for the integrated video, since there was a lot of memory available.<br />- The network driver, and 2-3 other drivers, had to be installed from the Intel site.  I had hoped that Windows 7 would automatically install them for me.<br />- After everything was patched and setup (with Office and other necessary software), Windows 7 boots to desktop in about 15 seconds.<br /><br />I'm also setting them up with dual 27\\\\\" monitors at 1920x1080 resolution.  I hope it's easier on their eyes.  1920x1200 on a 24\\\\\" or 2560x1600 on a 30\\\\\" would be too tiny for them.",

I had a Creative Audigy sound card in my old computer and, in comparison the sound from the integrated chip set in my new machine was horrible.     I only listen to the 32 days of a large variety of music I have collected in iTunes. I don't do games and I don't watch movies. I have a 5 year old set of Creative 2.1 I-Trigue speakers I used with my old computer. The Audigy card drove them very nicely.    I plugged the X-Fi Surround into the computer and Windows 7 (64 bit) installed it without a hitch. I downloaded the newer driver from Creative and then installed only the Console -- to get the equalizer.  I plugged in the speakers, thanks to the provided RCA adapter, and played the first movement of Vladimir Feltsman's version of Bach's \\\\\"Italian Concerto,\\\\\" followed by Warren Zevon's \\\\\"Werewolves of London.\\\\\" I was absolutely delighted with the quality of the sound which was much better than that of the Audigy, which was very good. The X-Fi Crystalizer performs as advertised with respect to bringing compressed sound files back to life. I also like the almost ethereal sound of my really nice Sennheiser headphones.     I am very satisfied with this little box with the big knob I don't have to use because the I-Trigue volume and bass controller does. It produces sound very close to as good as my daughter's XiFi Titanium card with comparable speakers. There is virtually no difference in headphone performance.

Not mentioned in either guide or manaual is the removable drive bracket has a spacer you need to remove in order to install your drives. This took me a minute to figure out. The PDF on the disk is also the only place where it lists your username, password, and default IP which you need.<br /><br />Took a while to figure out how to configure windows 7 to see the valkyrie. Follow the instructions as per the pdf manaual and then in Win 7 under advanced sharing  settings make sure to turn off public folder sharing, turn off password protect sharing, turn off use user account and passwords to connect to other computers. The way win 7 is set up by default does not work.<br /><br />Make sure the valkyrie is using the same workgroup name as the rest of your network (done through valkyrie net tool - access via web). I had some trouble getting raid 1 configured, I finally formatted both drives at the same time through the web utility and it all of a sudden worked, where as formatting them one at a time and it did not seem to work. Not sure if this was the fix but formatting both drives at the same time certainly is faster. Just start one drive formattting and then imediately start the 2nd drive formatting.

I was originally planning to buy an Airport station, but its additional features (such as a built-in modem) are really of no use to me. So I decided to save the $100+ and go with the Linksys. I also went for b over g since the speed of my connection is limited by my DSL line, and I'm not going to be doing a lot of filesharing among my computers, so there didn't seem to be much sense to spend the extra money.<br />I've had the router set up for a couple of weeks now and everything is working like a dream. I have an iMac and a PC connected to it with ethernet cables, and then I have my iBook with an Airport Extreme card. Setup was fairly easy -- it's done through your internet browser (I did not install any of the included software). My iBook immediately recognized the network when I fired it up, and reception appears to be fine throughout my 2-story house.<br />A word of caution: the router runs on a 2.4Ghz frequency, so there is interference with cordless phones that run on the same frequency. I've given the product four stars because a day or two ago none of the computers were recognizing the internet connection, but plugging and unplugging the ethernet cable out of the back of the router seemed to fix that problem, oddly enough. It's not a huge inconveniece, but I hope it doesn't happen often.<br />I'm also thinking about purchasing a wireless USB adapter (the Linksys WUSB12) for my TiVo to add to the fun -- no more slow phone downloading of program info!",

This is most visible in middle toned areas of my desktop, such as neutral grays. It's quite distracting. I sent an email to Panda City and they assured me that this is normal (though it could be because I JUST had them pay for shipping to clean my display for free, and they didn't want to offer another repair request). Regardless, I can't unsee it. (Note: I've asked several other people on Youtube who own this product, and they did not report this issue!)<br />...............<br />As of the time of writing, the Yiynova MVP22U v3 is hands-down the best 22-inch non-Wacom alternative.<br /><br />DESIGN<br />Other 22-inch HD non-Wacom alternatives have some perplexing design choices: the downward-facing cables in the back, the fact that the monitor rests on the power/menu buttons, etc. However, the Yiynova alternative doesn't have any of these: The cables come out of the side, and the monitor buttons are unobtrusively in the backside. I also enjoy the large bevel around the screen, which allows me to draw towards the bottom without the desk getting in the way of my hand. Compared to a Wacom 22HD, it has fewer buttons, and therefore less customizability. My only caveat is that Yiynova decided to place the buttons on the top of the screen--it's not unusable, but it's sort of an awkward spot. However, they work fine and are firm to press. I have never had driver issues with the buttons--I was able to program them with no issues.  Some may prefer Wacom's textured surface to Yiynova's glass, but it doesn't bother me. It's really a matter of preference--however, the reflectiveness of the screen does become a minor issue.<br /><br />SPECS<br />It's a full 1920x1080 screen--the colors are great, and it looks great. Plus, it's got an IPS screen with great viewing angles. The UC-Logic based digitizer provides lag-free tracking and VERY nice pressure sensitivity. I've used Wacom Graphire and Bamboo tablets for years, and the pressure sensitivity has never felt this great. I've also briefly used a Cintiq 21UX and the Yiynova feels just as great.<br /><br />DRIVERS<br />If you're doing research about Cintiq alternatives, you'll hear a lot of red flags about the software, no matter which non-Wacom alternative you're looking for. I can't speak for Huion or Monoprice, but as I understand it, most of those companies--Yiynova included--have made many improvements with software support. It works perfectly with all Adobe products and Mischief (by The Foundry), which is all I've been able to test so far. I've had a few hiccups at first--but I contacted The Panda City and they advised me to delete some lingering Wacom driver files that remained despite my reinstall. PROTIP: Uninstall all Wacom drivers BEFORE using UC-Logic based digitizer products, and install the proper drivers BEFORE you plug the device into your computer, especially if you're using Windows.<br /><br />ANY DEAD PIXELS?<br />No. No dead pixels in my unit. However I can't speak for other models. If you have 5 or more (or something like that) they will replace your unit, as far as I know. I can't confirm this because I haven't had this issue.<br /><br />A MINOR NOTE<br />The MVP22U has a glass panel in front that is held together by little plastic hooks around the edges (which come from the black plastic piece in the back). I received my unit with the glass panel a little bit raised above the plastic hooks on the top. I assumed this was normal, so I installed my unit and it worked flawlessly. However, after a while I noticed that dust started to settle underneath the glass, because it would fly in from the raised glass panel. I emailed the Panda City and they assured me that this was unlikely, because the inside is apparently sealed. They said that the issue is easily fixed by gently pushing in the glass so that it locks underneath the plastic hooks. Somebody on Youtube confirmed that their unit also arrived like this, but they did not report any dust issues. REGARDLESS, The Panda City offered to clean my unit for free, and they even paid for the shipping (which is offered to customers within 3 months of their order, at least for this model). So, it was a bummer to lose my MVP22U for about 1 week, but when I received it back (just today) it's like new! They guy handling emails at Panda City is a real good sport. He diligently answered my emails promptly and was very patient with my numerous inquiries. Despite this minor problem, I highly recommend this model.<br /><br />I'm VERY happy with it. The price isn't cheap (even though it's half of the Wacom offering) for a relatively little-known company, but I'd say the build is very solid, it works great, and if Panda City keeps up their level of customer service, it's DEFINITELY worth it.stic hooks.

No bloatware!  Usually commercial PCs are loaded with bloatware and you need to clean them before you can even use them.  The only thing I had to uninstall was Windows Media Player (slows down boot) and this is a Windows problem....not a bloatware or Dell/Alienware problem.<br /> 2.  Best bang for your buck on the market<br /> 3.  Packaged driver updates via AlphaUI<br /><br />The AlphaUI kinda sucks.  When you click it, it will log you out of Windows, then log you in as the AlphaUI user, then load the UI.  Not only is this a bad user experience, but the two accounts know nothing about each other!  So any data you save under your account (like saved Steam games), AlphaUI will know nothing about them.  My solution for this was to delete the AlphaUI  icon from my kid's user account's desktop.  He just always uses the desktop, not AlphaUI.  I am trying to raise an intelligent human, not a console junkie. :)  The only downside is updating the AlphaUI is how the box upgrades the drivers....so I sneak in his room once a month, load AlphaUI from the start menu, update AlphaUI, boot back to desktop.<br /><br />The CPU, RAM, and HD are all easily upgradeable.

The Internet stereo is on the other side of the breaker panel.<br /><br />Installation: one of the easiest yet. Truly plug-and-play, without any software installation or configuration needed. Each Zyxel unit is plugged directly into the wall socket. Each wall socket has two plugs, and the other plug is used by a power bar with lots of stuff hanging off it. I'm also not using the encryption feature.<br /><br />Performance: The server-to-HTPC leg (same side on breaker panel) moves 10MB/s via NFS protocol, or roughly 80Mbit/s, and the server-to-stereo leg (different side on breaker panel) moves roughly 2MB/s. For the stereo, the Zyxel shows an \\\\\"amber\\\\\" speed indicator colour, indicating a reduced 10-40Mbit/s rate, which is in line with my benchmark results.  Unlike wifi, these units provide reliable and steady bandwidth with very little deviation.<br /><br />Overall these units have met my goal, so 5-stars here!  Internet music and movie are now hickup free.<br /><br />Warning to those expecting 500Mbit/s (or even 200Mbit/s) --- the HomePlug governing body has drastically overstated the real-world speeds for all three of their HomePlug standards [HomePlug(85) HomePlugAV(200) HomePlugAV2(500)]. My best speed of 80Mbit/s using AV2 units now only matches that of the HomePlug's first 85Mbit/s standard.

Don't they have REAL people test these things? Third, blue tooth pairing is soooooooo unreliable. I have an iPad 4 and have tried it with Paper 53, Sketches, My Brushes Pro, Inkpad, iDraw, Inspire Pro and SketchbookX. Bluetooth works beautifully when you are in Pogo connect app but constantly disconnects as soon as you are in a drawing app. Also, there is absolutely NO pressure sensitivity once you are out of the Pogo connect app. I have a Sensu brush/stylus that, unfortunately has no pressure sensitivity, but is a great stylus. Don't waste your money on this thing.",

PITA if you ask me.  Furthermore using it with my wife's canon sd100 and my canon 1d it would \\\\\"band\\\\\" the pictures.  There would be chunks of the picture missing from it.  These cameras were supposed to be \\\\\"supported\\\\\" Some pictures would just show up black.  I tried several card recovery applications and one was able to recover some of the pics but I lost several from our honeymoon.  The videos were even worse, they were showing up as if the quality was 320x480 really bad and grainy.  There transfers were via USB because the wireless feature wouldn't even work.  Too bad i waited so long to use it because its out of warranty before i used it.  Crap product.  Stick with Lexar, Sandisk or Transcend.  I have been shooting digital since 1996 (Kodak DC25) and I have never had a problem with a SD or CF card, I have seen cards with issues but never any of the cards I owned and cared for except the EyeFail.",

I wanted something small and stylish with enough room for accessories, and this is just right. I also carry a Lacie external hard drive for classes that fit nicely in the front pocket and room beside it for the power adapter. Besides the pockets on the front for tablet there is also a large but narrow pouch on the back for a narrow legal sized binder. Nice lining for the laptop compartment that is wide enough for any laptop, with a firm rubberized padding around the edges of the entire case for shock proof. No real need for another sleeve as this is small enough and has good padding in the right places and looks like it could keep your laptop dry if you get caught in a downpour, although a sleeve would add even more protection, and there is room for it. Very impressed with STM. Some reviews complained about the velcro being too loud but I find it well designed  with the right amount for easy access but secure beneath two flaps for your laptop and zippered pocket on the front. There is also a lot of complaints about not being big enough for all the things in the picture plus their lunch and an umbrella. Well for that you need a backpack. This the perfect size for day use for laptop plus accessories and a few other devices.

Hmmm real head scratcher there and googling this board will not get you any results that will explaing this ...<br /><br />  WELL NOW your thinking Oh crap I just wasted my money ----  NO YOU DID NOT this board actually has many more configuration options than the other board listed by Sainsmart on amazon that actually costs more it simply has the connector that is 5v+ broke out into one for each signal and labled as cw+ clk+ and enable+ you simply tie all three together and hook them to the 5v+ from your parallel port breakout or microprocessor<br /><br />  I did blow mine up but that was entirely due to my lack of knowledge in electronics and hooking it up in various ways trying to get it to work The nice people at sainsmart have done everything they can to help resolve this and I have not asked for a free replacement because while this boards connectors are a bit confusing they are correctly marked for anyone familiar with electronics and I am the one who caused the issue here I actually like the layout of this board much better that the other two I had purchased if the other type and will be ordering several more just like it.Even after I told them I was at fault they still asked what they could do to help with resolving this and I told them I do not expect a free replacement but that a bit of a discount in the replacement would be nice when I order it I am very impressed with their commitment to customer satifaction and quick response to customer inquiries when contacted.<br /><br />  remember eneabl+ CW+ and CLK+ all connect to the 5v+ on your device suppling controll signals  the 5v+ on a arduino for example and you have no problem",

You download books onto the Kindle. Many books for the Kindle are free or very inexpensive. The font size can easily be magnified so that anyone can read from it. If you do not want to read, it will audio read to you. The size is perfect and so lightweight, you can take it anywhere. My husband's favorite part is the FREE 3G. When the DSL was down at his work, he was able to check his email and search the internet. The battery life is exceptionally long. We like the graphite color instead of the optional white. After doing research, we found that people who bought it in white, discovered that the plastic cracks much easier than the graphite ones. We put a skin on the front and back, a screen protector, and bought a carrying case, to protect it even further. You can read in all kinds of light without glare. You have all your books in one place. You can highlight a word and get the definition for that word. If you are reading a book and it references another book, it allows you to go to that other book. It even has 2 built-in games. The only downside is that it doesn't have color, but that is not a problem for us. The Problem is that my husband has turned into a Kindle junkie.",

So I was super excited to keep moving up the Kindle chain.  There were a few problems right from the get go but I have to say they were resolved.  I was able to hook it up to the WiFi.  After about an hour, my KFHD kept dropping the Wifi every minute, literally every minute.  It was so annoying.  I called Amazon, they were nice but were unable to fix the problem.  They thought I had too many connections to wifi which at the time there was only one.  Amazon wanted me to try connecting to another wifi, well not possible until I got to another place or something.  They would follow up with me the next day.  I went ahead and did a factory reset on the KFHD and reset the wifi.  It finally worked and no more dropped wifi.  The next problem I had was trying to have gmail and calendar synced.  It kept giving me an error that I didn't have permission.  After about 3 hours trying to work on it looking online, it looked like alot of people had problems syncing gmail and calendar.  I was tired and went to bed.  I was able to sync my yahoo and work email calendar.  The next morning I tried it one more time.  I don't know what I did differently but this time it worked.<br /><br />One more thing that is a little annoying but not a deal breaker is that I cant tell when it is charged.  My regular Kindle Fire had a light that was orange when it was charging and then would turn green when fully charged.  There is nothing like that on the KFHD.<br /><br />So let me say this, I love my Kindle Fire HD, there were just a few hiccups at the get go.",

The smaller type is readable so you can pack more per page, and it doesn't shut off if you take your time to read it.  It is not quite as bright as the pictures indicate and it does glare in direct sunlight.  You have to hold at an angle from external light.  It is readable in dark in case your power goes off, but a bit blurry in the background.  Despite these flaws, it is far more clear than what I've tried in the past.  Handhelds only give you a paragraph or two at a time, small letters are difficult to read.  I tried Ectacto Jetbook, which is similar but letters are a bit digital looking.  A laptop computer is good for getting a lot on the screen, but bulky.<br /><br />It is obvious Amazon Kindle is creating a momopoly in the world of ebooks and I resent that.  Downloading is mainly by WiFi and surfing on the Kindle only gives you best sellers at top, it's a pain to find more interesting independent writings.  It will download other formats, but not very well and not very easily; the file manager on this is lousy only pictures, and you can only see a few files at a time, and you have to enter page number to turn.<br /><br />I would had liked a page turn button, screen will get greasy after a while.  Pressing finger responds variously and pages tend to black out a second before turning.  I'd like to find some stick to press, as usual these small devices are poorly designed for men with big fingers.<br /><br />Anyway, it's better than what I've had to be, but it needs work and more flexibility on the software and downloading.

The highs are unbelievably crisp and the bass hits hard &amp; clear at all volumes. The mid-range sound is not muddy like your often time hear with computer or self-powered speakers. The key in all this is at very low volumes, while other people are working in the office, the sound is still beautiful and crisp through the entire dynamic range of the speakers.<br />If you have the money, go for a Klipsch product, but if you want a GREAT value with beautiful sound and style pick yourself up a pair of these.

The table is working out wonderfully for my child and you can expand the memory with a MicroSD card, a real bonus in the realm of budget tablets. I recommend it. Just check out the end of the stylus before you let your kid use it ;)",

The fan comes on when you startup windows...sounds like a little hair dryer tucked inside.  When I first started class, my classmates and I would make jokes about how it was \\\\\"blasting off\\\\\" every time the fan came on....which is every 5-7 minutes, and then the fan only runs loud for about 30 seconds.  So, with that being the only complaint, this thing rocks.  I imagine if the loud fan REALLY got to you, you could take it in to a shop and have a quieter fan put in....not sure how feasible that would be, but cant see why it wouldnt work.  UPDATE: Sept. 17, 2005  I figured out how to solve the loud fan issue.  You need to run the fan diagnostic in the BIOS at startup.  The computer will then calculate the proper speed of the fan based on what you're using it for at the time.  After that, the fan was MUCH more quiet.  DO IT QUICK!",

So it kind of defeats the nib being smaller as a benefit. When you hold it higher up, the pen cap wiggles from side to side throwing off your preciseness a bit.

So, it got a system installed on it twice with a zeroing erasure between. It seems to perform fine, and I'm glad to have the extra space. As a side note, I went to the local Mac store to see what they were selling, and they had the same drive for twice as much. It's a shame that they mark it up so much, I might have bought it there. This was a worthwhile experience for me, and for anyone who isn't afraid of taking apart a laptop. So long as your warrantee has lapsed and you don't carry some Mac Care like plan, this is a very economical way to get more memory.     As for comparing this brand to others, I can't say. I would have gone with WD, but I had an external drive by them that crapped out, but that's a very different product, and often you can get unlucky with these things.

After a few tweaks using the Samsung software, it did speed up but suddenly developed a BSOD problem.  I nearly gave up until I updated the drivers in my ASUS motherboard and activated AHCI in the registry. (google it) After i did that, no more BSOD's and my performance speed more than doubled. Windows now boots up and ready to use in less than 30 secs.  Photoshop is up in less than 5 seconds, and nearly everything, from my browser to my windows explorer feels snappy and fast!

I even tested the inexpensive hdmi to TV and my kids love seeing / playing those games on the TV.  Now, I can watch videos from youtube on the TV with total control.  The HD  quality promised for the Fire HD is nice even on the TV only if the video is an HD video.  No delays, but it does need a little bit of time to boot up before operating.

Inside the cover is a pencil holder and a flap for a few papers--I love this feature!  I'm always jotting down stuff I want in plain sight, not in the Notes & Marks file.  The cover is made in China, but it is well made--the fit is precise and the stitching tight.  In short, it looks fabulous and functions perfectly.

The sub is absolutely HUGE so buyer be ware of this if you don't have room for a large sub.

It also changes the input from computer, aux 1 and 2 for things like iPod or TV.  I have a 32 inch LED with only has an optical out for sound.  I want to listen to Blu-ray 5.1 surround on this 2.1 channel system.  So, I purchased a Gefen Digital Audio Decoder for $89 that can decode the 5.1 sound to a 2.1 by having both a coax and optical input.  I bought this and all the necessary cables in Amazon - the SP2500 only has a 3.5mm input (both Aux 1 and 2) and the Gefen has a dual RCA stereo output so you will need a 3.5mm male to RCA male cable.  It works GREAT and this sound system would get a 5 if the sub were a little tighter.

This thing will also max out Farcry 3, Minecraft, Bioshock Infinite, Batman: Arkham City.  These are the games I own and have tested on, but it's safe to say that pretty much any game you throw at it, it's gonna be able to max it out with little issue.<br /><br />I'm upgrading from an AMD/ATI Radeon HD4870 card, and the performance gains are incredible to say the least.  The old card has recently started to struggle keeping up adequate frame rates. I have to hand it to the HD4870 though, that thing can still run today's games reasonably well at some lower resolutions and slightly reduced quality settings and lower FPS.  But enthusiast gamers want to turn on ALL of the bells and whistles, and this card allows me to do that.<br /><br />As far as the software goes. I have to say, I do like the NVIDIA geforce experience software, although I do miss the AMD/ATI overdrive settings on the Catalyst software. This card does NOT support the geforce LED visualizer, as it appears to lack the reference design LED screen. That's fine, but a little extra eye-candy would definitely be welcome. Not gonna ding the card for this though, as the price/performance is excellent.<br /><br />- Physical aspects.<br /><br />It is a triple fan design, the first image on the card is definitely incorrect, although the second photo does show the correct product.<br /><br />The card is very large, the specs page says it is 10.5 inches long.  If you're not sure your case can fit it, then definitely do a little measuring first, from the back of the case where the DVI port will stick out down into the inside of your case, and see if you can accommodate a 10.5 inch card.<br /><br />The temps stay nice and cool from what I've noticed, though I do have a case with great airflow (Antec 1200).  The card is actually pretty quiet, and I have noticed no coil whine from mine (I did read about this card having a coil whine issue though, so take that for what it's worth).<br /><br />- Power demands.<br /><br />The design specs recommend a 600W minimum power supply.  Definitely make sure you meet this, as an underpowered card will run poorly or not at all.<br /><br />The card needs an 8-pin PCI-E power connector, AND a 6-pin PCI-E power connector.  I have a Thermaltake Toughpower 850W modular power supply.  I had plenty of 6 pin cables, but no 8 pins.  Luckily, the card is supplied with a &#34;two 6 pin to one 8 pin&#34; converter cable.

The card is actually pretty quiet, and I have noticed no coil whine from mine (I did read about this card having a coil whine issue though, so take that for what it's worth).<br /><br />- Power demands.<br /><br />The design specs recommend a 600W minimum power supply.  Definitely make sure you meet this, as an underpowered card will run poorly or not at all.<br /><br />The card needs an 8-pin PCI-E power connector, AND a 6-pin PCI-E power connector.

Setup was straightforward and my 802.11G and 802.11N devices came on line easily. Potential purchasers should be advised however that the unit's backward compatibility to 802.11B devices is questionable. I have two such devices that are indeed compatible with my prior router, the Belkin G FSB7234, yet neither one recognizes a wireless signal from the ESR9850 when it is in mixed mode. Engenius' tech support, for their part, had me try various alternate settings, but none solved the problem. Yet in the face of reasonable doubt as to its 802.11B compatibility, they refused to consider that my particular ESR9850 could be defective, asserting that \\\\\"if it were defective it would fail 100% of the time.\\\\\" In other words, since it worked for my G and N devices there could be nothing else wrong. And let's be clear - it's advertised to work with B devices, doesn't work with my B devices, but they are satisfied that nothing is wrong with it.  So regardless of whatever is really at the root of the problem, I'm stuck with an Engenius router that does not perform to its advertised promise.  What do they do about it? Referring to my problem, they've told me \\\\\"We consider this matter closed.\\\\\"  And here's something else potential buyers should beware of - Engenius' return/repair policy. Check out their RMA Request Form on their website. You'll discover that if for some reason your Engenius product malfunctions you will have to fill out the form, send it back to them with your proof of purchase, wait for them to grant authorization, wait for a carrier to deliver the product to them, wait for them to do what they have to do to fix it, pay them what they decide you owe them, then wait for the return shipment. Do you want to be without a router for that length of time? What kind of position would you be in if you felt the charge for repair wastoo high? Providing an alternate router for troubleshooting and/or for keeping your network up during the repair/replacement period is evidently not a popular Engenius policy option either. I know because I suggested it, and they deemed it \\\\\"not necessary.\\\\\"",

The drive did not power on until it was connected to both the electrical outlet and the computer and as long as the unit is connected to the power sources, the white power light remains lit.  The light is very small and to me it is not that bright.    My computer added the software that is located on the Hitachi drive first before it added the hardware, the drive.  The drive shows up as one letter and the software shows up as another letter.  The drive arrived as 32 bit so I copied the software to another drive, deleted the partition and created a new partition in which my drive was created prior to creating a new partition.  I did this several times because the software remained on the Hitachi drive even after I reformatted the drive.  Then I notice that the software is recognized as a CD-Rom and a UDF file system which may explain why I could not delete the software.  The software takes up 295 MB of space leaving the drive with 931.07 GB of space or 99 percent free space.    I am able to copy and paste files on the drive without using the software just as you would do with almost any drive.  You are able to click on the drive without the software popping up.  I did not use or add the software nor do I have intentions at the present to use it.  However, these things are listed on the software's menu, Get Ready to Relive, Automatic Organization, Stunning 3D Browsing, Local and Online Backup, Instant Sharing (Facebook, and two other icons as I cannot recognize the other two icons), Install Lifestudio, Learn More, and Formatting.  The software is powered by Cooliris.     I am running XP but I also have other OS' and I do plan to connect them to the other OS' as well.    The drive came with a power adapter as well as the USB cable in which the length of the cables are long enough for my use.    I did not take a star off for not being able to remove the software because they run independently of one another but I would love to use the 295 MB of space that I cannot recover.  Therefore, I decided to put it in my review so each reviewer to decide how important not being able to reclaim the 295 MB.

Great for downtempo high bass music such as chillout or hip hop.  sounds just like a mini shelf system.  Also has a nice aux input in the front.

I found that LCD widgets that were available for this game were not all that useful compared to the information that I could have displayed on-screen. And since I had a second (and third) monitor, the Ventrillo widget really was not for me either (in the sense that I could glance at the second monitor rather than look down to see who was speaking). Really, the widget that I did use most often was the CPU/Memory monitor. But even then, since I upgraded to a new gaming rig, there is no reason to monitor these statistics. After thinking that the LCD monitor would have been the best invention in the world, I have found that I do not need it at all.

That said, hopefully they can release these drivers and drivers for Yosemite coming out next month.

Package arrived in a bubble wrapped aluminum pouch,not the box as pictured. Also, the it was ship from 'Laptop Battery One'. So I'm confused since the Amazon website stated 'Sold by: LB1 High Performance' which I thought was direct from the LB1 company.<br /><br />First day of use, it lasted close to 2 hrs. I fully charged it and lasted about 1 hr only on 2nd day of use. My computer detects the battery while it is being charged. However, it does not seem to monitor the charging capacity correctly. Jumps from 87% charged to 73% charged to 50% charged to 71% charged and keeps dropping. Also states 2 hr 30min to 1 hr 40 min to 1 hr 30 min remaining, etc. Just jumping back and forth. While I'm writing this review, it states 61% charged with 1hr 17min remaining.<br /><br />I'll observe the battery for a few more days and will update my review. Will give it 2 stars for now.",

They seemed to have continued this tradition.<br /><br />I needed a larger SDHC card for my Panasonic LX3, which also shoots HD video and raw photos, demanding high transfer rate and large storage capacity. When I found this package for a bargain price I took the bite, as it is also a micro SDHC format for uses with smart phones and PDA devices, among an increasing list of other miniaturized electronics that are adopting to this now universal standard (olympus and sony just abandoned their xD and memory stick on their latest crop of products/cameras). There is no premium for this versatility as other standard sized SDHC cards sold for about the same price if not more at the time of my purchase.<br /><br />Frustration free package (see uploaded photos) is just a brown envelope with the manufacturer packaged hard case inside holding the adapter and the card itself. I believe the packaging is sufficiently protective. Amazon actually put this brown envelop into another small shipping box. It is probably not necessary, but I appreciate Amazon's taking extra precautions.<br /><br />The microSDHC card looks well made, fresh off the press with no scratch or smudges, and printed digits. It fits very snugly into the SD sized adapter, that you have to push a little harder to get it in. There's no wiggle or shakes after it sits into the slot. Nothing feels flimsy about this package, which probably should be the par but often isn't.<br /><br />Transfer rate also performed as expected. I have a sustained rate of over 6MB/sec during download transfers. There has been no problems using it with the LX3 by downloading straight from the camera's USB port, or using a SDHC card reader. I have experienced no problems (yet) and the card had been reliable, while providing the responsiveness (cycle time between RAW capture is negligent compared to a slower class 4 or even a class 2 card) and transfer speed (for large HD video files) that I seek.<br /><br />There's not much one needs to do for a flash ram other than its reliability, functionality, and durability/build quality.

I also bought the Amazon case at $45 and I will be returning it since it cost so much more than the MoKo case but doesn't deliver enough additional value.  If you've got an HP TouchPad and the HP case for it, this case feels exactly like that one.  It definitely doesn't feel as sturdy or as elegant as the Amazon case but at less than a quarter of the price and still of pretty good quality it's definitely a worthwhile purchase.  There's no magnetic closure so your device won't turn on and off when opening and closing the case.  If you're OK with that the only thing you need to be concerned with is that this case has no opening for the microphone!  I'm planning to drill a hole for it and hope it doesn't look too bad.  This is the biggest oversight with this case and would be an unforgiveable flaw were it not so cheap.  The other thing I don't like is the elastic strap that holds the lid closed feels like it will stretch out after a while and become useless, time will tell on that one.  On the positive side, it is a MUCH better stand than the Amazon case.  The Amazon case acts as a stand by opening it to a V shape and turning it upside down.  It feels very flimsy in this position and could very likely fall flat on a table surface.  The MoKo case, on the other hand, acts as a very sturdy stand which will definitely not fail to hold your device upright.  I took one star off for the missing microphone hole, otherwise this would get 5 stars, great price-performance ratio.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the same email as other purchasers got regarding the free replacement being offered when the new case is available.  They state that the new version of the case will have magnetic closure and a hole for the microphone.  If this is true I will be extremely happy to get the new version.  Those changes will make this case an unbeatable value even at twice the price.  I will update this review when/if the free replacement arrives.<br /><br />UPDATE #2: I received the new version of the case as promised. The KFHD turns on and off when the case is open and closed and there is a cutout for the microphone.  This is a great case for the money and I highly recommend both the case and the seller. It's a much better value than the Amazon case and the seller really stands behind their product. I am revising my review up to 5 stars from 4 stars.",

It also has an awkward metal bar on the bottom that makes it impossible to use the laptop anywhere but my desk (e.g. I can't comfortably sit it on my lap).  It also is hard to fit my laptop flat on the surface because I have an extended life battery that protrudes out from the bottom of my machine (when you sit the laptop on a flat table, it is on an incline solely due to the shape of the battery pack).

This may be a good thing in disguise (can't break it if you can't bend it too far) but because of the inhernt curl to it (from being packaged for a while) it tends to curl up (shorten) and drag the hub with it.<br /><br />3)  The power supply takes up to much space on a power strip...  it wouldn't take much for an engineer to have designed this very low-output power unit so that it fit into one plug space ... most of the other peripheral companies have already figured this out...<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with the unit for what it is.

            "input": "A very solid tablet. I'm going from a 2013 Nexus 7 to this. My tolerance for hitches in animation are a lot higher than what I've seen from tech review sites and places like the Android subreddit so if you're the kind of person that is driven insane by some jerkiness in screen animations, then my user interface experience won't be representative of how yours would be. I will say that the UI has more jerkiness to it compared to the 2013 Nexus 7. This may be fixed in an update but right now the Nexus 7 I have is a smoother experience yet to me the screen jerkiness is pretty much negligible. It isn't anywhere close to being in every animation. To me it's so rare and minor that it doesn't even make me flinch. Now for the real review of which I never use tablet cameras so don't expect any insight for that ever from me.  This tablet from comparison videos and pictures doesn't look that much bigger than the Nexus 7 but when handling it, it is definitely larger. The weight feels slightly heavier than it but both are very comfortable for me to hold in one hand. The size of the 9 makes moving your hand around more to navigate more prevalent but the added size in an absolute plus to me. The screen is gorgeous. It isn't as eye popping as the Samsung Galaxy Tab S tabs that I've handles but the screen is a marked improvement over the 7. Whites look a lot more whiter and blacks look deeper. My tablet doesn't have any issues with backlight bleed. Reading PDFs/books and comic books is a huge improvement. I don't need to zoom in anymore. Websites are more legible and using the tablet in horizontal posture is now usable. Watching videos, the black bars do not bother me. Videos look great on the screen and the viewing angles are great. At least watching older 4:3 shows now fills the whole screen. Using Word or Excel benefits greatly from the size of the screen and the lower PPI compared to the Nexus 7 hasn't bothered me at all. Pretty much everything about this display is an improvement to me.  It doesn't feel like the most premium tablet but I keep it in a case so it doesn't matter to me. The main annoyance are the buttons. When I find them, I can push them easy enough but they don't protrude as much as the Nexus 7 so they're harder to locate. Since they're smaller pushing them requires more effort as they're almost so slim and flush with the tablet, it's like they're not buttons at all. That is annoying but I can deal with it. The good thing is that the Nexus 9 has the double tap the screen to wake so at least I don't have to use the power button. At least it doesn't look as bad the older Nexus 9s. The tablet has those HTC Boomsound speakers. They're a definite improvement over what I usually hear from tablet and phone speakers but they're still tablet speakers. They're very clear and louder than the average but nothing to be incredibly impressed with. I always use headphones. Big negative though would be the lack of a microSD card slot. I've learned to live with USB OTG cables and PLEX since Android tablets have sparse options, but I would definitely prefer microSD slot. This will probably be a tank of a tablet so I won't be buying a new one for years but the next one I buy will definitely need a microSD slot. In particular since SOCs have now reached a speed that I won't care how powerful future tablets will be in a couple of years, they'll all be incredibly fast for a device with limited multitasking functionality.  The tablet uses a Tegra K1 with their 64bit Denver based cores. It rips through games that I play of which are pretty much just old PS1 JRPG games that have been released on Google Play so nothing too hardware intensive. It smashes word search and tetris as well. My main reason to upgrade was because the screen size and aspect ratio of the Nexus 7 made reading a chore, but the other reason was video playback of higher quality videos on it were choppy. The playback would be fine with my Snapdragon 801 equipped Sony Xperia Z2 but the Nexus 7 would play them choppy. I've tested with the Nexus 9 some really high quality h.264 videos on it. They're 4k 75,000 kbps bit-rate videos and the Nexus 9 has no problems playing them. The Snapdragon 801 plays them just as well but the Nexus 7 can't keep up. The strength of the tablet is pretty awesome to me. Even though there are small animation jitters here and there, the navigation experience to me is beyond satisfactory for me.  An overall solid tablet experience is what I'd say about this. It has a great screen with great size. The weight is light. It's great for reading and watching videos. To me the experience isn't any worse than an iPad or Samsung tablet. I wish the volume and power buttons were larger as well as the tablet having a microSD slot. Also getting rid of all jerky animations would be preferable. Those make this tablet imperfect but I can get over any of that. If not this tablet I would recommend the Galaxy Tab S8.4 since 7 inches is just too small for optimal reading and it's just barely a good enough size for videos. 10 inch tablets that are 16:9 are too long to be that comfortable to use. 4:3 and 3:2 tablets are more solid in its usability in both screen orientations. Even the full size iPad is too big for me yet the iPad mini is too small to me. 8.9&#34; tablet with a 4:3 screen ratio is good sweet spot to me. This tablet is awesome. It's a much better companion to a desktop than a laptop is to me now. I would recommend this tablet if people asked me.",

Followed video installation instructions and this time the screen was much smoother and clearer, but in the time I was spraying the solution, etc a few micro dust particles must have landed on the surface (from probably moving the air around as I positioned the screen protector).  The result now after drying overnight is a very nice product, with a few minor bumps and one \\\\\"smudge\\\\\" (can't really explain how or what it is - it doesn't affect viewing, but I can see it when reflecting light).    Pro's:  Lifetime replacement warranty  Very high level of transparancey  Feels and glides better than the Gorilla Glass  Cleans easier and smudges less than Gorilla Glass    Con's:  Exacting install required - follow directions closely  Some screen imperfections show up in light reflection, but haven't noticed in viewing movies or docs, etc.  Not being advised to use for 1hr after install and allowing 4+ hrs to dry is a long time (unless you do it at night and allow to dry overnight as I did).  I'm not big on fluid required installs, but the fluid does dry fairly quickly.    Overall - I would recommend this screen protector if you are looking to protect the screen of your Transformer (I'm not going to open a discussion on Gorilla Glass) to prevent damaging the glass.  The overall result is very good, but not as good as glass alone.  Whether this is the same with other protectors, I don't know, but will summize it is (especially for a screen this large).    I hope this helps much more than the original review.  When I do replace this again (which I probably will) I will be in a clean room in a suit (just kidding :) ) - but realistically, if you can make one final dust check before you apply you will probably get a great install.",

Upon receiving the item, I noticed that the tongue latch was a bit difficult to open and easy to lock into place.  It does not seem, to me, that it will withstand the daily use and will eventually come apart.  I have noticed that after using it for 1 day, a tear has appeared on the stitching that is holding the tongue latch.  I give it about a month before it completely tears off.  When holding the tablet open while browsing the internet or playing a game, whether it is in Portrait or Landscape, you will have difficulties holding it with one hand. The inside fabric is slippery.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Beautiful Craftsmanship.<br />Note 8 snap in holder is ideal when looking for a case/cover.<br />Outer Material used begs to be held.  It just feels really nice in your hands.<br />Tongue Latch works great to keep it closed.<br />Landscape stand.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not a good grip while reading or using the tablet in Portrait or Landscape mode, slippery and a challenge.<br />Nothing to help with holding it with one hand comfortably.<br />Latch is in the way.<br />No way to hide the latch when the book cover is open.<br />Already see a tear in the material where tongue latch is attached.<br /><br />Room for Improvement:<br /><br />Alternative 1: Tongue latch should have some extra ribbon on both sides that can be used to unlatch when closed, this would make it easier to open.  Then, if you would like to latch the cover when it is open, another ribbon or material that would allow you to unlatch so you could close it.  This can be a ribbon or same material as external and internal used to match and keep it looking sharp.<br /><br />Alternative 2: An elastic band that is on the back to lock the cover in place.<br /><br />To make it easier to hold with one hand, use a hand or two finger strap that is located on the inside of the top cover to make it comfortable to hold while the cover is open and latched, of course, this would only work with Alt 1 or 2.<br /><br />STM, if you are reading this, my suggestions would make this a 5 Star Book Cover.  You are on the right track, hopefully your R&D is testing the use of these covers.<br /><br />That is all I can say about this cover. If you don't mind the latch or the fact you will struggle to hold onto the case while using your GN8, then this is a nice find.

Wrote back & told them that it wasn't the plug and I had a 15\\\\\" PowerBook.<br /><br />Now, let's take a step back.  I am someone who takes my time choosing a product.  While shopping, I double checked the advertised specifications - the wattage was exactly what the Apple store employee told me to get (65W), as well as exactly the same as my previous power cord.  The voltage, part number, etc. - all of it were EXACTLY THE SAME.  And, nothing in the listing for this product said anything about it only working on a PowerBook of certain screen size.<br /><br />Forward to after I sent \\\\\"MAC HOME\\\\\" my second message, telling them I have a 15\\\\\" PowerBook.  They write back, \\\\\"Please be advised...\\\\\" (I'd like to interject that this is a strange way to start a letter to a customer addressing a product issue.  But I digress...).  Then they proceed to say that this model of power cord doesn't work with a 15\\\\\" PowerBook, and that I needed to order an 85 watt cord, which I was welcome to order from them (which of course costs more and would take more time to receive).  They said I was also welcome to return the cord I purchased through Amazon.<br /><br />Are you kidding?!  You falsely advertise your product and/or send me a faulty product and now youare telling me that to get what I paid for (ie a product that SHOULD work with my computer), I have to purchase something more expensive from you AND go through the return process?!<br /><br />I wrote back, explaining that I'd done my due diligence and that the product I was led to believe I ordered should work with my computer.  I also said that I expected them to send me a product that DID do what they said, without further cost to me. They wrote back and repeated what they had said before - that I was welcome to return the product through Amazon.<br /><br />So, in summary, FALSE INFORMATION IN LISTING, PRODUCT DIDN'T WORK, NO EFFORT TO REPLACE IT, and IMPERSONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE.  The only plus was the promptness with which everything happened, though what good is that when the product is crap?<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY.that I was welcome to return the product through Amazon.<br /><br />So, in summary, FALSE INFORMATION IN LISTING, PRODUCT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL, NO EFFORT TO RECTIFY THEIR MISTAKE, and FRUSTRATINGLY IMPERSONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE.

The laptop handled itself well with minimal slow down.<br /><br />I just have a few critiques.  The keys feel mushy. They don't have a crisp feedback. I think it's due to the fact that it's so low profile, the actual key travel is not very long. Secondly the screen is a nice matte surface but the viewing angle is very small.

But, then the screen just quit working on the bottom half. I was reading it on the plane, turned it off and put it in my briefcase, then sat down on my layover to start reading again and the screen was shot - nothing but lines on the bottom and some vertical lines running up through the left side of the screen to the top.  Nothing hit it, it wasn't dropped, wasn't near anything magnetic, just an outright failure. I'm sure they'll replace it, but after reading how often this seems to be happening to people I'm not sure I want another...seems like the lower cost of these new ones may be the result of poorer manufacturing quality.

No waiting.<br />-Unlike a paperback, the Kindle can be laid down on a flat surface without losing its page.<br />-If you like pulp-grade science fiction of the &#34;25 Story Anthology Collection&#34; variety, there is a huge amount available on the Kindle at extremely low prices.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-The Kindle lending library is difficult to browse, and can only be accessed on the Kindle itself-- not on a computer.  I suspect that Amazon intentionally crippled this functionality to encourage people to buy books rather than borrowing.<br />-Some books are not available in Kindle format.<br />-Magazines are very limited.

It also sits perfectly on the little stand I have (I use one of those free-standing frame/plate holders!

It's true that you can't really fit much else inside the case, but it'll hold your passport, tickets, receipts, etc, which is convenient for traveling. I keep the case on all the time.

I manage a big team of visual effects artists and constantly run around checking in on the status of their tasks etc. I have replaced my stone-age clipboard with my hot-pink-encased iPad and a few sheets of paper in the pockets.

If you have a skinny enclosure, make sure you can fit 9 1/2\\\\\" of width before purchasing.  Lots of holes to hide your cables behind and the extra width means you can get them all out of the way (full tuck) provided you have the right cable lengths.  Lots of air thanks to the 200mm fan in the front.  This also means it'll bring in a lot of dust.  What I do is purchase a good home air filter and cut it to size to place behind the front air intakes but in front of the fan.  Keeps the dust trapped and the components safe.  I suppose I could reduce temperatures with a high end CPU cooler but the case keeps everything cool enough for a stock CPU fan.  A LED on/off button at the top turns the red light off if you're not into that sort of thing.  You'll also need to purchase a power supply separately.<br /><br />My only gripes:<br />1) The money I saved will need to be spent on a [[ASIN:B002LE8BJA 200mm Case Fan]] because they didn't include one for the side panel.<br />2) The tool free 5.25\\\\\" device works good but the 3.5\\\\\" device doesn't work well.

I use a can of air on the insides at least once a month to keep the dust out so I'm disappointed I have to replace a $20 fan in just over a year.",

Second, the drive is partitioned. In actuality, I think it is two separate flash drives stored inside the device because there is no way to format and merge the separate 32 GB portions of the drive. Finally, the biggest problem is the slow data transfer rates. It makes transferring large files very painful. It's not necessary to purchase a really high end drive to get decent data transfer rates. I've used the Kingston Data Traveler, the SanDisk Cruiser, and the Corsair Flash Voyager with much better results.

This small and lightweight Chromebook is perfect for that.  Some people will say why bother with a Chromebook when they can do networking from their cell phone.  That is true, but some of us prefer a larger screen.  In addition to web browsing, the Chromebook works great for one person watching online programming (e.g. Netflix or Amazon).  In addition, it is good for listening to online music (e.g. Pandora or Amazon Prime).  Other plusses of the Chromebook are that it powers up quickly, has a good battery life (10 hours), auto-updates (including virus protection) are built-in, and probably most importantly, it is very reasonably priced.  In addition, it has two internal speakers, camera with microphone, HDMI port, 2 USB ports, micro SD card reader, audio jack (headphone-out and microphone-in), and a Kensington lock slot (should you wish to lock your computer).  While it has limited storage on the laptop itself (16 GB), additional storage is on Google Drive (cloud).<br /><br />A few negatives \u2026 The Haier Chromebook cannot run some of the programs we use, such as iTunes or software applications requiring a CD-rom.  While its small size is often a benefit, we prefer viewing some things (such as spreadsheets and certain videogames) on our larger desktop monitor.  The Chromebook keyboard has a different \u201cfeel\u201d to it and it doesn\u2019t have a mouse, so using the Chromebook takes some getting used to.  Also, because the description stated, \u201cMicrosoft Office is not compatible, but Microsoft Web Apps are compatible,\u201d I was concerned that certain email attachments may not be readable.  I experimented by emailing Word and Excel documents from my Microsoft Outlook email to my gmail.  Viewing (and editing) was NOT a problem; as it turns out, Chromebook automatically updates to allow viewing/editing of Office files.  However, it is a downside that Microsoft Office itself does not work, as it is so widely used.<br /><br />Despite its drawbacks, we are impressed with the Haier Chromebook as an additional laptop computer for the money.  In fact, we are considering getting another.  Would recommend, but be aware of its limitations.wever, it is a downside that Microsoft Office itself does not work, as it is so widely used.<br /><br />Despite its drawbacks, we are impressed with the Haier Chromebook as an additional laptop computer for the money.

Basically for under $450 now I have laptop with specs well over $650.    Then I went on Acer website, updated my BIOS to Version 2.00. And everything is as smooth as butter. One thing I noticed and was surprised with, is that my battery life actually improved by about 30-45min.

I often wait a few weeks to months before writing reviews of tech based products, especially cases, because it is important to see how they hold up in atleast the long term.<br /><br /> With that said, I am happy to announce that Kuzy has delivered on a wonderful product. For just 25 dollars, you are getting reliable protection, a sleek look, and very minimal weight.  I bought mine in black, and I would highly recommend this color as the illuminated Apple symbol shines through the black case, giving it an awesome, modern look. The case itself fits very well and has no wiggle room. The firm fit hugs the Mac very well, looking as organically as part of the device as possible, adding to the style of the case.<br /><br /> Make no mistake about it, this case is indeed plastic but don\u2019t let that turn you away from it. I was initially hesitant upon purchasing this case as plastic is known to have many problems including easy cracking, and a poor look but I have not encountered any problems with my case. This case has definitely protected my Mac because I can see visible scratches and marks on the case, where without the case itself, my Mac would have been damaged.<br /><br /> My only few gripes with this case deal with the installation and overall durability. When first putting on this case, it can be difficult because there are no instructions and you just kind of have to figure it out. You have to snap on this case, which comes in 2 separate pieces, one for the back of the screen and one for under the keyboard. Various times through the process, I was applying a lot of pressure and power and felt like I would either break the case or the case wasn\u2019t locking into my device properly. You also don\u2019t hear any snapping noises as pieces lock into the Mac, which only makes me wonder more of I installed it properly. But after a bit poking and prodding, it is easy to figure out thatthe case has been attached firmly.<br /><br /> Another large issue is that there are 4 rubbery pads at the bottom of the case, which help it remain stationary as you put your Mac on a table and type away. Unfortunately, my rubber pads fell off within weeks of getting my case! Because they are off, my Mac noticeably slides around easily with the case on. It\u2019s not a huge deal but it is upsetting as the occasional wiggling and furious typing can move around the Mac easily.<br /><br /> If you have 25 dollars and are looking to purchase a solid, and reliable Macbook Pro case, I would highly recommend this Kuzy Rubberized Hard Case. For 25 dollars, it is a very sleek, lightweight, protective, and snug-fitting case that will definitely last for years to come, I\u2019m sure.",

I consistently noted my Dell xps15 was a furnace but I mistakenly assumed the designers had accommodated for this concern. I was absolutely wrong.  Not only do I have an expensive paperweight,  when I contacted Dell xps customer service I learned my warranty barely had any time left though it's a brand new laptop. I wish I had known of these issues before plunking down 4 digits on a laptop with such serious issues.  Please learn from my costly mistake, ensure you have an automatic backup solution for your files,  buy a backup laptop to use when the Dell xps15 is in for repairs and only use with a very powerful laptop cooling system.  Or save yourself the hassle and buy a laptop from a different manufacturer.<br /><br />My Dell xps15 has been out of commission long enough at a critical time so I had to buy another laptop to use,  an Acer with an i5 processor.

Yes,  I was literally sweating and turning the ac colder when I used my Dell xps15 laptop.<br /><br />Meanwhile,  waiting for the empty shipping box from Dell ('overnighted' arrived 3 days later) I realized,  by the time Dell repairs my xps15 and returns it,  my laptop will essentially be out of warranty.  When this happens again,  which assuredly it will due to the unresolved heat issue, the repairs will be too costly to deal with,  particularly since this will be an ongoing problem.

Now with the smartphones and tablets out there...CD's and DVD's are fast becoming a thing of the past.  I can't even recall the last time I used a CD or DVD.  I have all my music and movies on my computer and simply need to hook my smartphone up to my computer to transfer what I want onto it.  I used to have a laptop but had to sell it a couple years ago.  I began thinking about getting another but...I had to look at how I use technology now.  I came to the conclution that I don't need a DVD drive which ended up nixing me needing a full on laptop.  That said...I still liked the idea of the laptop style (keyboard and mouse pad).  I didn't need anything super big...but having a tablet with perhaps a keyboard dock would fit my needs.<br /><br />After awhile o searching...I found the Lenovo IdeaPad S2110.  WIth it's keyboard dock it not only gave the tablet the look of a laptop...but it even went a step further and included a full SD Card reader and two standard USB ports in the keyboard.  I was floored.  I have an external USB drive hooked up to my computer which stores my movies.  A simple way to move them onto the tablet is to either plug my external harddrive into the tablet keyboard or via a thumbdrive.  Bingo...just like a laptop.  The keyboard also includes the mouse pad...which by the way I've had no issues with unlike some of the posts on here.  Some reviews I've read stated the mouse moves to fast.  My opion...it's BS.  As long as you don't race your finger across the pad the mouse moves across the screen just as any other mouse would on a regular laptop.  And...there is an option in Settings to adjust the speed of the mouse.  The keyboard is awesome and feels great to type on....not cheap.  The buttons have great feedback...and the best part about the keyboard is it's internal battery.  The fact that when fully charged...it deliverspower to the tablet is beyond awesome.  I can go an entire day plus (depending on how much I use it within a day) on a single charge thanks to the keyboard.  As the tablet's battery starts to deplete...the keyboard provides it with power thus...the keyboard's battery is the first to drain...then once it's depleted the tablet's battery kicks in and starts to drain.  Awesome feature.<br /><br />The tablet itself is two thumbs up.  Awesome screen with nearly any viewing angle.  Crystal clear.  The processor is fast and keeps up with most games...so far any game I've downloaded.  With it being Android of course...I've been able to set it up like a laptop.  The additional bluetooth keyboard and mouse I purchased work great with this devise and in fact I've typed this whole post using the bluetooth keyboard.  My only &#34;sigh&#34; was that the tablet itself doesn't have a micro-sd card slot.  Since I'm using this more or less like a laptop however and will hardly ever have it out of the keyboard dock...the fact that the keyboard has a full size SD card reader meant I was able to place my 32 gig card there which serves as a &#34;harddrive&#34; if you will.  An extra 32 gigs on top of the internal 16 gigs in the tablet.  It was an acceptable give and take for me seeing how I'm using this tablet...but it might not be so much for other users who'd prefer the tablet have the SD slot.<br /><br />Still over all...I would recomend this tablet/keyboard setup to anyone.  It's solid...has some weight to it...and is super clean.  I dare you to try it if you're looking for a tablet with a laptop feel.  It's about the same size as a netbook...but should you want to use it as a tablet you can...that's the whole point about these hybrids.  Once you get it...you wont want to return it...",

The one I had previously was very hard to set up and it took a lot of work just to put in a WPA2 security code. So of course, I was a little bit weary when getting this.<br /><br />Prior to the Belkin N150, I was using a Netgear router that would constantly interrupt my PS3 streaming capabilities. It was also slow and I was just ready to be done with that one.<br /><br />Now, for the setup of the N150, this is the first router I've remember owning that I had to install the Belkin software just for the router to work. Most routers just requires you to plug in the cables and it would start working. I found that a big no no as I want it to work right out of the box and not have to install anything extra on my computer. The configuration of the security was easy enough and I would suggest that once you install the software and the Belkin is working, you should uninstall it. The software itself is not really good and it cannot figure out that one of my desktops I connect directly to the internet via an ethernet cable and it keeps trying to turn the wireless card on my desktop on. You can still get to the page to configure the router's settings by going to 192.168.2.1.<br /><br />As for the connection of the router, I did find that it was a lot better than the Netgear in that when I am watching a moving on my PS3 that is streamed from my computer, it does not cut out as much as the Netgear. With the Netgear, I was usually guaranteed to have a hiccup with each movie/show that I watched.<br /><br />It was very easy for the router to be connected wirelessly and for the most part, it would keep the connection. Still, while it has been an improvement from an older Belkin I had, there are still some stability issues to be addressed and the set up was a bit tedious.<br /><br />Still, this is a decent start-up router. If you are someone who has a lot of experience with routers though, you may not be impressed.",

I don't mind the weight of it on my back on my bicycle on the way to the train.  It's more of a small laptop than a netbook.  I'm quite fine without a built in CD/DVD; I'd prefer not to have the extra weight and bulk, but I do have the Lite On Etau208 [...]<br /><br />Amazingly this inexpensive little computer has not just a dual core processor, but three USB ports, an HDMI, a VGA Port, a LAN port, built in wireless, and an SDHC reader.  It weight just two ounces more than my 9 inch netbook and is thinner.  It also has a keyboard with the keys in the \\\\\"right\\\\\" place; a full sized \\\\\"enter\\\\\" key and full sized right \\\\\"shift\\\\\" key.  The touch pad is multi touch, and even has two separate buttons for the left and right click instead of the cheap single rocker you find on many netbooks.  The speakers are loud enough to comfortable listen to the dialog from a movie or TV show.<br /><br />The snappy performance coupled with Windows 7 gives the whole experience of using this computer a very smooth feel that is very pleasant.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change is that I bought the 1810TZ model and the 1810T model is only $50 more for a larger hard drive and 1GBmore of RAM.  I thought this one came with 32 bit Windows 7 which I thought I needed to run a finicky program that I have.  Ironically this computer actually came with 64 bit windows 7 and my finicky program, which has never run right on 64 bit Vista, runs fine on this.

I was hoping for less problems with the actual headphone and mic jack because of the trouble with the usb connection with the Arena headset.",

My experience using it has also been disappointing.  The button clicks are very stiff.  I frequently find the mouse scooting away from the target while I'm trying to click.  The surface for performing the gestures isn't smooth enough and the mouse is arched so highly that your fingers quickly tire from having to lift them to perform the gestures.  Because of the perceived flimsiness, the mouse lacks a well-controlled, solid feel as it slides across a surface.  The combination of this poor control and the tendency to scoot when pushing buttons makes me use the arrow keys and keyboard shortcuts rather than the mouse when editing text.  Getting the cursor to the right spot or getting the right-click to occur in the right location can be just too stressful.    It performs poorly on non-standard surfaces where other mice still perform well enough.  The arm rest of my chair is far from an ideal surface, but where as cheap mice track well enough and allow for clicking, this mouse fails to track at all or tracks far too quickly as if it's unable to make up its mind.  The button clicks are so stiff that they are nearly impossible to perform on the soft surface of my arm rest.    While it has a wide array of available gestures, they aren't for any activities that I frequently perform.  In my week and a half of owning the mouse, I haven't used any of them for window management.    Considering the price and the hype, I find this mouse very disappointing.",

Recently, my TrackMan Marble gave out, and I replaced it with the TrackMan Marble Wheel. I found it to be a quality product as well.<br />Having used a TrackMan before, my thumb already was conditioned for use, but I still had to adjust the mouse settings in the Control Panel to make sure I could reach all parts of the screen. I have a little difficulty because I'm missing some muscles in my right hand, but I can still use the TrackMan well.  I also appreciated the customizable buttons - the wheel doubles as a third button, which I use as a double-click button. There are many other options available, including the ability to switch the click and right-click buttons if you wish. I was disappointed to see that Logitech didn't make this a four-button mouse; I would have liked to see the three original buttons (from the TrackMan Marble design) remain and have the wheel/button be a fourth button. Also, I found the wheel to be a bit more difficult to use as a button - I tend to scroll as I click from time to time, which causes me to open things I didn't want to open.<br />The wheel is very valuable - I found that I missed it immediately when I went to a computer without one. The wheel makes scrolling much easier in applications, and you can set the scroll amount from the Control Panel as well, although you may have to find a compromise because you can't set the amount separately for separate applications.<br />The quality is excellent. You certainly won't have to clean it as often as traditional mice, although it still needs to be cleaned periodically (or more often, if you're into Diablo-type games). Cleaning is easy - just insert the tip of a pen into the little dot on the mouse, and with a turn, the retaining ring pops out and the ball can be cleaned.<br />You can use this in a USB port or as a PS/2 mouse; however, if you plug it into a USB port, understand that you may have difficulties if you have several USB devices or if you have an intensive device like a Zip drive connected. I've rarely experienced problems, but on occasion, if my Zip drive struggles, it locks up the mouse as well. This is more of a USB issue than a Logitech issue, though, as you can tell from reading the Iomega Zip reviews! Just keep it in mind.<br />I've never felt bad after buying a Logitech mouse, and this was no exception. The only suggestion I'd make to Logitech is to design a left-handed TrackMan Marble. I like to divide my home and work usage equally, especially when a Diablo II or Icewind Dale is released, and you can't get one of these for a lefty. Other than that, I give it high marks and would definitely recommend it.e; however, if you plug it into a USB port, understand that you may have difficulties if you have several USB devices or if you have an intensive device like a Zip drive connected.

            "input": "First off, if you're considering just getting a pouch-like cover that doesn't open like a book, don't. The ability to hold the Kindle like a book is possibly the best reason for getting a cover. You really can't go wrong with the Amazon leather cover, and if you think it's expensive you should browse around a bit; most of the higher quality covers are in this price range, with some being even pricier. I don't believe this is a situation where an \\\\\"official\\\\\" branded accessory is being overpriced, as is often the case with such products.    Pros:   -Sturdy materials. The hard leather, stitching and lining appear to be solidly crafted. This case will long outlast the Kindle itself.  -Strap. So far as I can tell, the strap is unique to the Amazon case, and it's most excellent. Far better than button/belt style closing mechanisms I've seen in other covers.      Cons: The top hinge allows for some lateral play, meaning that the unit moves ever so slightly away from the hinge, whereas the bottom hinge is flush against the Kindle. This causes the kindle to be slightly crooked, with the top of the unit sliding away from the hinge a tad further away from the spine of the cover. It's a mild flaw that should have been taken care of while in the engineering stage, but it doesn't seem to affect the security of the connection. It also could be that this is an issue unique to my case, and if so, maybe someone could comment in that regard.     Possible improvements: I understand how the hard leather would be very durable and resist wear, but I think a slightly softer, cushier (even thinly padded) leather could have been utilized while maintaining durability. It would make the case a little more pleasant to hold, as the rigid leather can be a bit hard on the fingers, and a softer cover would provide a bit more impact resistance. And let's be honest: most people aren't going to keep their Kindle for nearly as long as even a soft leather case would last. We've had three Kindle models inas many years, with each requiring a new size cover. We don't need a cover that optimizes its materials to last a hundred years at the compromise of comfort.    Advantages of other cases: There is one aspect of some of the other cases that I liked-- some of them held the unit in place with sleeve-like attachment, formed with cutouts allowing access to keyboard and buttons. The reason I like this is because it does a bit to \\\\\"hide\\\\\" the device, other than the screen and buttons. This has an effect of making the Kindle a bit less obvious in its gadget-ness, covering the plastic (and the Amazon Kindle logo) with leather or what not.     Update, 12/12/2010:    I'm sad to say that I have become one of the unlucky bunch whose Kindle does not play nicely with the attachment hooks. The details of this issue can be read in a number of other reviews, so I won't go into details. I will say this: Many Kindles (maybe even most) work fine with this case. If you aren't one of the unlucky ones, you have an excellent cover. Most people would not suspect the case at the onset of problems, so I think the best advice here if you are really intent on purchasing this cover, or have recently done so, is to contact customer service at the first sign of freezing/rebooting.     Amazon Customer Service has been so exceptional throughout the ordeal that they still have my trust as a customer. Mistakes happen. Electronic devices are not impervious to unforeseen problems. How the company handles those problems is more important, and hopefully Amazon will make good on resolving the issue for those who experienced it.",

Here's the method I used in order to place flawlessly the protector, without a single (not even a microscopic one!) bubble -- but do not use if you don't feel confident with it, or else you might actually get many more than following the instructions:  - After perfectly cleaning your screen (and making sure any curious pet is nowhere near!), pull the red label to reveal a horizontal strip of the sticky protector (toward the button, where you have the big circle cut). Place very carefully over the iPad, aligning it neatly.   - Then, holding the rest of the protector in a kinda diagonal way, peel completely the mask and let fall gracefully over the iPad. It will stick to it just perfectly. Remove any bubbles with card.   - Then remove black label mask. (If it seems like there's a bubble, it will most probably be because of this one.)",

This took a little while to get used to as well, but once you do it's like nothing ever changed.

I haven't messed with the 3 side buttons much at this point, but they are well placed and easily clickable without fatfingering them all at the same time.  Ergonomically the g500 is good but takes a bit of getting used to, it slopes off severely which took my wrist a little while to get comfortable with.  The fact that this is a corded mouse had me a little apprehensive at first but I've actually come to appreciate it. The cord has never gotten in my way and its nice not to have to worry about batteries and mouse wake-up time.  The adjustable weight seems like a bit of a gimmick to me as I can't really observe a noticeable difference when playing between any given weight settings.

I've never used a &#34;mouse surface&#34; before, but I can tell you with all honesty that the transition from a standard mouse pad was seamless and indeed, a game changer. My mouse tracks effortlessly over the smooth, paper-thin surface. I have it affixed to my wooden desk and the grip is extremely strong- it hasn't moved one bit from the spot I placed it in. It seems durable and easy to clean, but I would still be careful not to spill anything on it or get to rough with it. To top it all off, it looks great in dark black with a couple Razer logos (and looks quite cool paired with my Razer Tarantula Keyboard).<br /><br />This is a solid buy for this price range. I anticipate getting many years of use out of the Sphex.<br /><br />One thing to note, I use a wireless G700s Logitech mouse laser mouse. Your mileage may vary with using an optical or trackball as the Razer Sphex was optimized for high DPI mice.",

There is no separation between automatic WAN settings with DHCP and full manual IP settings. You can't use DHCP and also use a custom DNS server. However contrary to some of the other reviews you can go full manual and use a custom DNS server.  The options are pretty vanilla, not much that's highly customization. You can run more than one wireless access point at the same time. Here the options are limited too. One regular network and a guest network. I haven't tried it though.  Work on Charter networks.  Update Edit............... 4/8/2016   The real reason that I wanted this was for a little more control than what I would get from Charter. Every time I want to do any moderately sophisticated setting like open a port up on the firewall I get no decent options. Or what is provided doesn't work. I'm talking about you port filtering.  Has changing your DNS settings while using DHCP and port management not been around since the beginning of home routers? My TiVo will not work with the firewall on. VPN also fails. And there is weak firewall options.  I'm going to have to run my own firewall on an extra device. The whole point of me getting this was to have less devices to avoid more fail points.  Attached is the only Firewall options you get. Miserable. Do not buy. Too much money for what you get.",

The keyboard is not as small as you would expect, when they say it is 92% of a normal keyboard, they mean it, it is only about 2 inches smaller than my desktop keyboard. The one drawback would be the right shift key, way too small and oddly spaced to be useful. Took a while to learn to use the left shift instead. Also, there is no keyboard flex as others have written, maybe they got older models.    The screen is nice and bright. Battery life is amazing, on power saving mode, with the screen just turned down slightly, wi-fi and bluetooth on, I get around 4, maybe 5 hours of battery life. 3.5 of constant use. The PC boots up in under a minute with what I have installed on it, and it has no problems since I've gotten it. It's also so quiet I can't even tell if there's a fan inside this. Doesn't get too hot either, very warm, but not lap-burning hot like many laptops do.    The speakers are what you would expect out of a laptop. The microphone and camera are good/above average quality and work well with skype.    Bluetooth connects well with no problems to my Moto Q phone, and my bluetooth headphone/headset.    Buttons on trackpad are a bit firm for my liking, trackpad is responsive, multitouch scrolling works well, but sometimes it hiccups and registers it as a \\\\\"click\\\\\". Also because of it's small size, it's easy to accidentally click on something when typing.    As for  the black finish, I like it, I don't get too many fingerprints on it, it does come with a cleaning cloth as well. A quick wipe every morning should solve anyone's problems. It also comes with a black carrying pouch/case.     I would also recommend getting the Logitech MX Revolution Nano. The small size of the mouse compliments the laptop nicely, and the nano reciever doesn't get in the way of using the  laptop pouch.    For most people, 1GB of memory(stock) should be plenty, programs load fast enough. But for users who open more than 3-4 programs at once, or even browse with more than 5 or so tabs open should consider upgrading to  2GB (DDR2-SDRAM 533/667, 200-pin). So far opening many tabs in Firefox and opening 3 programs at once cause the system to slow down for me.",

It is lightweight but I never felt the product would break in my hand. It is of unusual design though as one must move the contacts to fit the battery you are using and if you aren't gentle, you could break one of these off, however, I see this as a bonus of the design-- no extra parts needed to fit different batteries! The spring-loaded cover holds the battery tightly in place and there is a small LCD screen that shows whether the battery is charging, if it's fully charged, or if the battery isn't in touch with the contacts.

I was hoping to use it to mount my tablet on a gooseneck floor lamp that has a flat plastic light housing the same size and shape as that couch arm in their photo.  Well... it doesn't grip firmly.  On a couch as shown it is just sitting there with a bit of tension so it stays upright and in place... just don't bump it.  They also don't tell you about the rubber bands that go on the inside to keep tension. The tabs where the rubber bands attach bend inward and don't seem like they will hold up to the task of creating a firm tension around my lamp either.  The thing just wouldn't grip. I wish it was made of aluminum or something with rubber slots for the tablets.  That said... I LOVE THE LEG APPLICATION!  That alone is worth buying this mount for.  It works great. It also sits nicely on the counter.  I crochet so I was following my pattern & watching Netflix on my leg while sitting down but when I got up to do some things in the kitchen I just brought it with me & set it on the counter so I didn't miss a thing on my show. PERFECT!  Then I took it with me when I went to lie down in bed and put it on a pillow.  So for this reason I give it 5 stars with a possible 6 when they work the kinks out of the design.  I think thicker rubber bands, make it out of metal or plastic with more tension abilities, fix those tabs so they don't bend inward...  and this baby would be perfect. Another great thing about this product is its ability to have so many applications. I'm sure I'll find a lot of other uses for it as I go along. I'm about to go put a push pin on the inside of my kitchen cupboard to use this in the kitchen too. Happy with my purchase all in all.",

My friends and I would always joke around about Alienware and how expensive their computers were. We would go on to their website and try and come up with outrageous specifications in the customization menus back when single cores were big and dual cores were just coming out.<br /><br />I never thought I would one day finally purchase one for myself but it all started with one of the smaller units, the M11x R2 which I purchased from Ebay. I was so impressed by the versatility, reliability and performance of that model that my perspective of Alienware as a company was changed completely.<br /><br />I wasn't completely sold however and was not sure how far Alienware would go with having been purchased by Dell. I did a lot of research before ultimately settling on this model. I was looking for a laptop that I could use while I traveled overseas as part of my deployment in the military and was looking for something with a bigger hard drive, more power and a larger screen.<br /><br />There were quite a few brands to choose from, including models from MSI, Lenovo, and even Razers own &#34;Razer Blade&#34; Laptop. I wanted the best bang for the buck if I was purchasing a high end laptop and wanted the best specs with as much reliable performance it could give me. I did not plan to overclock or make any adjustments to timings or voltages and I still have not found the need to with this particular model.<br /><br />It really is an amazing machine, both in consideration with it's performance and the aesthetics. The laptop looks fantastic and is not overly flashy. There are a ton of options regarding customization for the desktop and the Alienware FX which controls the interchangeable lights on the keyboard, fascia and touch pad of the laptop.<br /><br />In addition to this it comes standard with multiple USB ports, one of which is consistently on so you can charge devices without keeping the laptop itself on. There is also a slot loading DVD-RW drive that gets rid of the worry of having the drive snap off or coming loose over time.<br /><br />A killer network card provides all of the speed I need on my current internet connection with extremely low latency in video chat, video gaming, and amazing speeds for downloads and uploads. I have never seen a laptop cap speeds before but this thing blazes through any application I throw at it in consideration with bandwidth and ping.<br /><br />Included with the model I purchased is a Quad Core-I7 4700MQ which has plenty of power and 8 threads for amazing multi tasking performance and keeps up with the most recent demanding games.<br /><br />This unit also has a single Nvidia GeForce 765M with 2GB of onboard memory with a native resolution of 1980x1080 or 1080p which is perfect for any current titles and the Nvidia Control Panel allows me to set specific settings such as forced Anti-Aliasing, Texture Filtering, Vertical Sync, you name it, this GPU has it.<br /><br />The hard drive has 1TB of space in total and includes a seperate 80GB SSD. The SSD acts as a sort of boost to the slower 5400rpm 1TB drive in that it caches frequently used data and applications so that you can access the information faster. I have not tinkered with settings regarding this and do not know if even doing so is possible but I have noticed significant improvements in load times after using the same programs multiple times over a few weeks span.<br /><br />The 16GB ram included with this machine is absolute overkill and I can't imagine anything out right now aside from heavy CAD software or photoshop uses anywhere near that amount, I did not necessarily need this much ram but it is future proof and saves me from having to upgrade in the future. In addition to this there was no way to select a smaller portion of ram so I just took it for what it was. Definitely not complaining about this feature but I can find no real world use for it.<br /><br />Another nice notable feature about this machine is the fact that the power supply plug is on the back right of the unit. I have seen some complaints about this but find that this is perfect for me. I do not have to worry about positioning the laptop a certain way when it is resting on my lap.<br /><br />All in all I am glad I purchased this machine. It was expensive and is definitely more of a luxury item than anything else but I am very satisfied. I would have loved to spend money to build a tower that has considerably more performance, perhaps even twice that of this current machine but as I am not sure where my life will take me in the next coming years I can't afford to cart a whole computer tower around and have to worry about not bringing it with me.<br /><br />In any case this is a fantastic machine, if you have the money to spend on it, read this review then make your decision. I hope what I wrote here helps reinforce the fact that Alienware is no longer a name, even having been purchased by Dell this is still a well known reputable company that provides a quality product especially if you are spending top dollar and know what you are getting.<br /><br />This is a great high end laptop. It will treat you well as long as you take very good care of it, just like anything else in life. Duty calls on my end over here so I will end this review with one final statement:<br /><br />I have owned many laptops for the short time I have been alive, I have built a few computers in my spare time since they were still using AGP cards and 256MB of ram and an 8GB Hard Drive was &#34;massive space&#34;. This is the best computer I have ever purchased.<br /><br />Thanks for readingt it was.

So i searched around and found the driver at the logitech site, after the installation, i was satisfied and happy, because i found out the the navigator can do much more than i expected, and can be configured to work with any program, because all the controls on it can be configured to trigger an action like a keyboard stroke or scroll the mouse wheel, for example in photoshop, i set the ring to zoom and pan the image, 2 buttons to go backward and forward through the history, one button for the brush, another for the eraser and touch tuner (the above layer on the controller reacts to by touch like the iPod) to increase or decrease the brush size. Its totally up to you to set it in any matter you need to any program, i even set up few configurations for several games! <br /> <br />I don't regret buying at all, however i think that the seller at amazon should declare more clearly that the tool dial is no longer available for windows, you can find more at logitech's site.",

I tried to follow Timothy Brown's instructions (see his Amazon customer review) which were very good but I think there are a few critical points that should be expanded on (like a more detailed description of the CFE page, the fact that the light on the router is off during CFE mode, and most importantly for me, unplugging the router from the modem when uploading the firmware to prevent an error about connection being reset/interrupted.).<br /><br />How to Upgrade this to Tomato USB in Windows (Warning this may violate your warranty and all disclaimers apply - proceed at your own risk):<br /><br />First download the correct files for this router - see Timothy Brown's instructions in his Amazon review of this product for the correct versions and download locations. But the ones I used were the following which were the latest as of the date of this review:<br /><br />tomato-F7D3302-1.28.7501.3MIPSR2Toastman-RT-Mini.bin<br />tomato-K26USB-1.28.7501.3MIPSR2Toastman-RT-Ext.trx<br /><br />Then:<br /><br />1) Connect the ethernet cable from your computer to the first \\\\\"Wired\\\\\" port (not the \\\\\"Modem\\\\\" port)<br /><br />2) Plug your ethernet cable from your modem to the \\\\\"Modem\\\\\" port<br /><br />3) Plug the AC adapter in to the wall and router<br /><br />4) Set the windows machine's static IP to 192.168.2.10, net mask 255.255.255.0, and default gateway and DNS to 192.168.2.1  If you don't know how to do this google it for your version of windows as it varies somewhat (in brief: network and sharing center->click on your network connection->properties->ip4 protocol->properties, fill out the screen).<br /><br />Here's a tutorial showing how to for Windows 7 (but DON'T use the numbers they show, use the ones above):<br />http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2009/11/26/windows-7-static-ip/<br /><br />5) Do the 30/30/30 reset:  Pick up the router and hold it front down resting against your desk, backside up, using a paperclip, hold down the \\\\\"Reset\\\\\" pinhole in the back of the router CONTINUOUSLY while doing the following: Wait 30 seconds, pull the ac plug out from the back while continuing to hold the paper clip in, wait 30 seconds, then plug the ac plug back in and wait another 30 seconds, all while continuing to hold the paper clip in.  Now you can let go of the paperclip. You're done with the reset. The router light WILL NOT be on but the router IS still functioning.<br /><br />6) Now UNPLUG your ethernet cable from the \\\\\"Modem\\\\\" port. I failed to do this and it cost me a couple of hours trying to figure out why I was getting almost immediate connection time outs in my browser when I uploaded the bin file (step 8 below).<br /><br />7) Type in your browser windows \\\\\"192.168.2.1\\\\\". You should get a totally different screen from the normal belkin firmware. It will be a very simple page saying something like \\\\\"CFE Mini-Web Server\\\\\" and will have a \\\\\"Browse\\\\\" button and and \\\\\"Upload\\\\\" button, a \\\\\"Reboot\\\\\" link and a link to reset NVRAM. If you don't see this and instead, the light comes back on and you get the Belkin configuration screen you did not do the 30/30/30 reset right so go back and do 5 again. If you see no light and get no internet connection make sure you set your static ip correctly (see step #4 above)<br /><br />8) Browse for and select the bin file you downloaded. Then click \\\\\"Upload\\\\\". On the bottom left of your browser it should show that it is being uploaded in increasing %. It will then give you a message to wait for a few minutes before you can reboot. Click continue when done. (If you don't get anything like this and it just times out and you get an error page see Step #6 above and take the modem cable out of your router! )<br /><br />9) After router reboots navigate to 192.168.2.1 in your browser. It will ask you for name/password, type in \\\\\"admin\\\\\" and \\\\\"admin\\\\\".  You should see the red tomato menu.<br /><br />10)Click on \\\\\"Administration\\\\\", then \\\\\"Upgrade\\\\\", Click Browser for file and click on the TRX file (one of the two files you downloaded).  Tick the checkbox to reset NVRAM settings.  Click on \\\\\"Upgrade\\\\\" button. Wait about five minutes and follow prompts to wait, and continue.<br /><br />11) When you're done you most likely will get a page failure error. Because the upgrade has caused the router's ip address (your default gateway) to be reset to 192.168.1.1. So you have to reset your static ip to 192.168.1.10, net mask 255.255.255.0, with gateway of 192.168.1.1 and DNS of 192.168.1.1. (similar to step 4 above but with the different numbers).<br /><br />12) Now go to 192.168.1.1 and you should be prompted for the same tomato login of admin/admin. Once you login you'll notice new features (usb,nas, etc.).<br /><br />13) Go to Administration page and change your password and login name to something secure.<br /><br />14) Plug back the cable from your modem to the \\\\\"Modem\\\\\" port or you won't have any internet access.<br /><br />15) You're done<br /><br />*****************<br />UPDATE 5/29/2013<br /><br />****************<br /><br />*******************************************<br />Install a printer:<br />**********************************************<br /><br />Follow this tutorial:<br /><br />http://tomatousb.org/tut:configure-printer-in-windows<br /><br />When done, test and make sure you can print from the computer<br /><br />*******************************************************************<br />Extend Your Wireless Network on a single SSID<br />*******************************************************************<br />I use the Belkin as a 2nd router extending the reach of my [[ASIN:B000BTL0OA Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router]], on which I also have Tomato installed, so that I now have near 100% signal in the far reaches of my house where the belkin is. I used the following tutorial to set it up:<br /><br />http://www.howtogeek.com/104007/how-to-extend-your-wireless-network-with-tomato-powered-routers/<br /><br />Both routers use the same Network SSID name so that laptops don't have to switch access points as they go from room to room.<br /><br />Although note that I ignored the advice in the tutorial to put the node on G for wireless network mode only and  set the wireless network mode on the belkin to auto. This allowed my newer laptops/ipad that have N devices to use the Belkin's N protocol and gets much better range.  I also ignored the advice on turning DHCP off on the belkin node and used DHCP on both routers.  But I set different ranges (the primary linksys router was set to range of 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.125, and the belkin node was set to 192.168.0.126 to 192.168.0.129.). That way there shouldn't be any issue with 2 different laptops being assigned the same ip by both routers. So far it has worked without a hitch. I also set the DNS on the Note to the ip address of the primary router.<br /><br />Note that if you have a wired connection between the two routers you can follows this (haven't tried this yet):<br /><br />http://www.howtogeek.com/104469/how-to-extend-your-wi-fi-network-with-simple-access-points/<br /><br />*********************************************************************************************<br />INSTALL AIRPRINT TO SHARE OUT YOUR USB PRINTER SO YOU CAN PRINT FROM IPAD AND IPHONE<br />*********************************************************************************************<br />I have an ipad but it couldn't print with that using my older USB only Samsung 4521f multifunction printer. Some newer networked/wireless printers have an \\\\\"Airprint\\\\\" driver installed which allows ipads and iphones with IOS 6 to print.<br /><br />I investigated and found that I had a few options:<br /><br />(1) I could try try installing Airprint to the router using Qui's excellent tutorial:<br /><br />http://blog.qnology.com/2013/03/tutorial-apple-airprint-on-tomatousb.html<br /><br />This allows you to print fromyour ipad without relying on any other computer being on all the time.<br /><br />I decided against this option. It's complicated, depends on linux CUPS driver support for your particular printer, may be unstable, and more importantly, note that at the very end of the tutorial the Qui recommends instead to get a POGO Plug and install the software on that.<br /><br />(2) After some more investigation, I chose a simpler option, which was to download and install an unofficial Windows Airprint driver on one of our Windows computers. This does require the computer to be on while you print from the IOS device but that usually is not an issue for me.<br /><br />Here are the steps:<br /><br />1) Follow the above steps to install tomato to the Belkin router<br /><br />2) Connect your USB printer to the router<br /><br />3) Log into tomato at 192.168.1.1 (unless you changed it to something else, like I have) and make sure the printer appears in tomato under USB and Nas ->USB Support (under Attached Devices) If it doesn't it may be a USB 1.1 device, so make sure USB 1.1 is checked and refresh the screen.<br /><br />4) Follow this to install the printer driver on your computer:<br /><br />http://tomatousb.org/tut:configure-printer-in-windows  When done, test and make sure you can print from the computer.<br /><br />5) Install Bonjour (if you have itunes installed on your Windows computer you shouldn't have to do this):<br /><br />http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999<br /><br />6) Download the unofficial windows Airprint driver onto the computer you want to use as your Airprint server (same as in #4 above) and install using the instructions here:<br /><br /> http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1293865<br /><br />7) Make sure the computer in #4 has selected the printer attached to the Belkin router and is sharing it out.<br /><br />8) Done - you should now be able to print from your IOS device as long as the computer in #4 is on and is sharing out the printer. If it doesn'twork make sure both the Airprint and Bonjour services are running, and/or reboot.<br /><br />This worked for me using IPAD 2 with IOS 6 and a Windows 7 64 bit machine sharing out a Samsung 4521f printer networked through the Belking router with tomato installed.",

Counting the zippered lower back pocket, there are five more on the exterior creating lots of space organizers. A person can literally carry an office worth, school worth, etc of materials in this roomy pack. I especially like the exterior, top zip area which is great for a wallet, passport, pens/pencils etc. Or, like my husband has used it, the pack is a great carry on for the plane carrying a week's work of clothes for a trip AND a small laptop computer.<br /><br />Speaking of computers, this pack is really excellent for carrying a laptop. The interior back panel has a padded sleeve that is up against the padded exterior back panels. This protects the computer AND your back and shoulders. There is another un-padded sleeve with a Velcro closing for papers. The interior is roomy enough to hold several books, or lots of clothes or camping gear. Also, the shoulder straps are adjustable, heavily padded AND have MORE storage area!

For VoIP and video conferencing, these are outstanding- the DECT wireless distance is just as good as my SNOM M3 handset and since you are hands free you can multitask and move around- great for IT professionals doing phone or remote support.  Audio output (ear pieces) is excellent for speech.  The audio input (microphone) is good but may sound a bit &#34;hollow&#34; to some- not quite as flat or &#34;dead&#34; as I would like it but still very clear which is important when doing podcast or screencast work.  The most critical I can be is when talking about the &#34;general purpose stereo headphones&#34; case.  There is no &#34;bottom&#34; to these ear pieces so you wouldn't be happy if want to use them for music streaming- that's not what they were designed for.  Listening to talk / news radio is a much better use case but occasional music or movie listening shouldn't offend your ears too much.<br /><br />I'm using these on a Linux system (Kubuntu 14.04 LTS) and its truly plug and play.  As is typical in Linux, there are no drivers to worry about.  You plug the base into a USB port, wait a couple of seconds for the system to detect the device and just select the mic or speaker devices as you would for anything else.  It probably should be mentioned that I use Zoiper as the VoIP soft client to my Asterisk PBX and that client does not allow you to answer of hang up calls from the button on the back of the mic boom.

The included User Manual was also fairly well done.  I was a little surprised that it took me awhile to understand the concept of the arm stand.  I assumed once the iPad was connected that it would prop up on it's own.  I didn't realize that I had to extend it away from the keyboard to actually use it.<br /><br />Once the iPad was in place, the functionality of the keyboard is really nice.  The extra features like the Home button and the Play/Pause buttons was a nice surprise.  I did notice that anytime I use the keyboard after not using it for awhile, it doesn't immediately recognize the first keystroke that I do, so I have to initially press the keystroke twice.  Also, I didn't realize that the iPad had to be placed with the Home button on the right to enable automatic Sleep mode when closing the cover.<br /><br />I do like the feature of removing the stand separately from the keyboard.  This case tends to be a very good complement to the iPad if used on a desk surface.  The angle of the stand is a little steep when using it on your lap.<br /><br />Also, when closing the case, it takes a little coordination to push the arm stand back in before shutting it.  When fully extended, it is a two hand process as you need to lift the iPad away from the resting groove with one hand while sliding the lock mechanism and pushing the arm stand in at the same time.<br /><br />I give it 4 of 5 stars due to the weight of the case, the fact you have to initially extend the arm stand to prop it into the resting groove, and the minimal difficulty in closing the case.<br /><br />Overall, very professional and well crafted keyboard case.

The differences are as follows By Ladan Khamsepoor // Sr. Product Marketing Manager, Video Business:<br /><br />There are a few subtle changes:<br />- While the QuickCam Pro 9000 offers VGA-quality video at 30 frames per second (high-quality video) on Skype, we made adjustments to ensure the updated Webcam Pro 9000 can perform up to VGA-quality video at 30 FPS on any video application, including Logitech Vid.<br />- The Webcam Pro 9000 was modified to be capable of adjusting to widescreen format and record 720 pixels (1280\u00d7720) at up to 30 FPS.<br />- Finally, software is no longer required for RightLight. Instead, we\\'ve built it into the device, so right out of the box, you\\'ll get the best image quality possible, regardless of harsh or dim lighting conditions. Perhaps too much information, but we also adjusted the firmware to make sure that RightLight engages only when necessary.<br /><br />[...]<br />---end excerpt<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I got a frustration free package and compared with a Quickcam version I got a little earlier.<br /><br />Yes the frustration free package one got recognized by windows 7 as \\\\\"Webcam Pro 9000\\\\\" while the earlier version is recognized as \\\\\"Quickcam Pro 9000\\\\\". The drivers and softwares specified by Logitech's website appears to be universal and Both cam had a \\\\\"driver information\\\\\" showing driver version of 12.10.1110.0. The firmware version reads 5.0.1161 on the Webcam 9000 and 2.96.6009 on the Quickcam, suggesting possible different firmware families than increments of the same firmware. It also may suggest that there are differences in hardware as well.<br /><br />Testing it in video mode--the quickcam version's flaw wasn't apparent at first, until one investigated closer. The HD video frame on the Webcam version is a little cropped, suggesting it used fewer pixels than the full frame sensor, or only 1280x720 out of the 1600x1200. You can see this when you switch to the 1600x1200 mode. That did not happen with the Quickcam pro 9000. At first I thought the Quickcam gave me a scaled down interpolation of the full resolution video, showing its full wide angle picture, which would have been advantageous over a cropped image on the Webcam version; but then I realized that it is really a scaled up interpolation from 800x450--in other words, full hardware HD video is simply not possible with Quickcam Pro 9000, while it is available on the newer Webcam version.<br /><br />Despite the less-than-ideal method of using reduced sensor area that produced a cropped image (thereby negating the wide angle lens advantage at full HD setting), I speculate that the Webcam version did this to reduce CPU load for interpolation. Still, I wish a full frame scaled down 720p HD mode is available as an option.<br /><br />What is more incredible is when I tried to record video. For some reason, the webcam version was able to record smooth HD video at full 1280x720, while the older quickcam version, despite the scale-up interpolation, had a lot of trouble with that resolution setting, or even at 800x450. I use a x61s thinkpad -- hardly speedy by today's standards. However, it goes to show something is done quite differently with the new webcam version, as the results are not even close -- I recorded non-HD videos that looked like still pictures jumping from frame to frame with in-tact audio using the Quickcam version, while the Webcam version was able to record fluid 720p HD videos without problems. Webcam version wins by an unbelievable margin here.<br /><br />Then the photo test: i imagined both camera will show full resolution in photo mode, or 1600x1200. NOT SO! At 1600x1200, which is supposed to be native resolution for both of these cams, the Quickcam version showed a blurry picture that clearly seems interpolated, or a scaled up version of 800x600. The details are just absent, and looked identical to a 800x600 image. The Webcam was evidently at 2MP with details that cannot be there with interpolation. Why can't the Quickcam version take photos at its native resolution is beyond me.<br /><br />The above tests made me wonder about these possibilities: 1. the newer driver simply doesn't support Quickcam pro 9000 version fully, and catered to Webcam version instead; 2.Quickcam Pro 9000 had always been a half baked product with these flaws, hence the upgrade; 3.something is wrong with the driver and/or the hardware as tested. If it's either #1 or #2, I find it incredible that Logitech was able to charge close to $100 for the Quickcam Pro 9000 version that doesn't deliver on its HD promises, and performed in reality only slightly better than my old Quickcam fusion.<br /><br />Testing the cams side by side in real use such as skype and msn, the image quality didn't look all that different -- a little soft than my liking especially for a cam of this price range. AF performance is also similar. There is very little difference that I can discern, other than the ones mentioned above, which is not subtle by any measure.<br /><br />For what it's worth: the webcam9000 that came in the frustration package is a little scuffed up compared to the Quickcam version I got in a retail package. The plastic on the camera is of a polished/mirror finish, so any hairline scratch/scuff/buffs show up instantly. There was none on the Quickcam Retail, but some on the Frustration Free Packed version wrapped in plastic bag. However I am not sure if it's really related to the packaging or production batches. I am anal retentive in that regard, but for most people it probably doesn't matter. The difference in the amount of plastic and packing material is mind boggling though. For the sake of the environment and savings, frustration free package is a real innovation.<br /><br />With regards to \\\\\"built in\\\\\" right light -- that sounds a bit odd (i.e. it scarcely makes sense), as right light is built into logitech's driver ANYWAY and is always software activated/controlled. On both cams I was offered the option of turning it on or leaving it on always. I believe from the inception, right light was hardware dependent (earlier Quickcams simply couldn't support it), suggesting there were hardware involvement in the cameras anyway. The fact that you don't need driver support to run it doesn't make much sense--the webcam doesn't run without its driver.<br /><br />Which is better? Webcam Pro 9000. The advantage over the older Quickcam version is significant--unless it's due to software/driver screw-up, which is a real possibility.<br /><br />I am open to corrections and would love to learn what others find.uickcam version showed a blurry picture that clearly seems interpolated, or a scaled up version of 800x600.

The adapter is a small rounded box about 1/5 the size of the brick-sized adapters that came with my notebooks.  This one, by contrast, is small enough to fit in a small pocket. It has two small prongs that flip 90 degrees out the side to make a plug that fits any standard US socket. Being only two prongs I guess there is no ground so it will fit any outlet, not just a three prong one. Having the plug basically flip out of the casing means you have a nice compact power supply with a fairly thin, roughly 10 gauge six-foot long cable that comes out of one end. The cable has a Velcro strap attached to it so you can wind it up into a coil for packing away tidily. There are nine choices of plug which are 90 degree plugs to fit your laptop. Eight of these fit on a plastic strip for easy storage while the ninth oblong non-90 degree one is separate and will not fit.<br /><br />Each of the plugs have a pair of pins. This is pretty standard really though each of these have a flat edge so that they only fit the cable the right way around. This ensures the right polarization of the cable.<br /><br />This adapter works well on our Acer notebook. It\u2019s tiny compared to the \u201cbrick\u201d and fat cables that came with it. However, it has less output than the factory supply: 65w instead of 90w and 3.25a instead of four.  It charges at about 2/3 of the speed which is fine for us. And works as well  when plugged in.<br /><br />Our other notebook is a low profile high-end Dell and none of the plugs fit. They have a smaller plug than any of the ones that came with this charger. I discovered that the oblong plug fits one of my external li-ion battery packs and lets me charge that about 50% faster than the charger that came with it.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the convenience of such a small power supply. For the Acer I have a nice form fitting neoprene case with a pocket. But the OEM charger does not fit and has to be carried separately. This adapter is smaller than our mini laptop mouse and both fit in the pocket together. Very convenient.<br /><br />It does get a little hot when plugged in. I guess the small enclosed size means there is not much space for it to vent heat from.<br /><br />It would be nice if a bag was supplied for the plugs to keep everything together. Since I only need it for the acer it\u2019s not a big deal.<br /><br />The only things I\u2019m not entirely happy about are that the six foot cable means you need to have an outlet close to where you are sitting. Three feet can easily be taken just by the desk height. The other thing is that even though the cable is polarized the prongs that pull out of the case are identical so you can plug the adapter in the wrong way. Normal, polarized plugs have one thicker stumpy one that fits a wider slot so you can only plug it in one way. When plugged in the wrong way the battery charging status icon does not show charging but doesn\u2019t seem to do any actual harm. Just doesn\u2019t charge the notebook battery. So you need to check that it is charging when plugged in.<br /><br />I recommend it.M charger does not fit and has to be carried separately.

But the real computing power lies in Windows-based tablets.<br /><br />While it\u2019s true that most any tablet will work just fine if all you need to do is visit a website or two, send emails, play a simple game or peruse Facebook, you really need the power and flexibility of a full-blown computer if you plan to do any real work.<br /><br />If you\u2019re looking for a true workhorse of a tablet at a great price, I believe you\u2019ll find that the Quantum View 10.1\u2033 Tablet and Keyboard with Windows 8.1 & Office 2013 is an outstanding option. This awesome device offers much of the power and functionality of Microsoft\u2019s Surface line of Windows tablets at less than half the cost.<br /><br />The folks at Quantum View managed to pack a lot of computing muscle into this tablet, allowing it to run Windows 8.1 and Office 2013 (both of which are included) much better than one would expect for a machine in its price range.<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed when I removed the Quantum View 10.1\u2033 Windows Tablet from the box was how sturdy and well-built it is.<br /><br />Unlike most cheap Android tablets, this one is made to stand up to heavy use. And thanks to the pre-installed Windows 8.1 operating system and Microsoft Office 2013 productivity suite, you can begin doing real work immediately after completing the short and painless setup process.<br /><br />Before doing anything else, I plugged the tablet into the wall charger and let the battery charge overnight. When I turned it on the next morning, Windows automatically launched the setup routine. After making a few quick selections, I found myself looking at a usable Windows 8.1 Start Screen. The entire process took all of about 5 minutes.<br /><br />After that initial startup/setup sequence, this tablet now fully boots to the Start Screen in about 10 seconds thanks to the super-fast internal flash storage. That\u2019s much faster than any of my Android tablets!<br /><br />When attached, the keyboard and trackpad make the Quantum View a true joy to use. They both respond quickly and smoothly to the touch, with no apparent delay whatsoever. And unlike Microsoft\u2019s much more expensive Surface, the keyboard and trackpad docking station is included at no extra cost.<br /><br />The only thing lacking in this tablet is an optical drive, but that\u2019s to be expected with any modern tablet PC. If you ever find yourself in need of one, you can always attach an inexpensive external USB optical drive to the tablet\u2019s USB port.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you\u2019re looking for a Windows tablet that offers plenty of bang for the buck, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be able to beat this excellent tablet from Quantum View. It\u2019s powerful, it includes everything you need to get down to business, and it\u2019s built to last.",

Finally, while it is nice to have the elastic handle, I had to add a strip of elastic band to wrap aroud the mini when I hold it in my hand like a book, otherwise the case will open and flop around a little.

Let's start with the design of the product.<br /><br />This is one of the best-looking NAS devices I've ever seen. It's not NASty looking like some of the others. And it sits on my printer shelf, with my handsome white printer plugged into it - so it fits right in. Really nice looking. Quick-access USB port on the front for my weekly external backups and a power button I don't think I've ever used beyond turning it on the first time.<br /><br />Reliability?  Yeah. It's reliable. The volume has crashed I think twice in the last year. But all that means is it needs to refresh. A power-cycle through the web interface takes care of this. My drives and data have been safe and unaffected both times. I don't remember what I was doing that caused the crash - I think several of us gamers were mounting ISOs from the same directory. Something atypical, for sure. It's hosted my music, documents and photos without issue for a year now. And it's pretty quick. But not like lightning.<br /><br />This was the main reason I bought the device. Because I read a ton of reviews and researched every NAS I could find for over a year before I made the jump. And I wish it was a little quicker. When I'm streaming music to another computer on the network, just using a mapped drive to the DS209 for the source, the music just cuts out for ten seconds at a time every ten minutes or so. Apparently none of these mp3 library apps cache the song they're playing. It does, however, work flawlessly when I use the built-in Audio Station interface. I just don't like it as much as Songbird or Banshee.<br /><br />I was going to buy another Synology to hold all my movies, and stream them to my multiple HTPCs, but after seeing how it streamed music, I've decided to go local on those.  Other than the speed though, I have had no problems with it. You can do just about anything you want with it. Add packages, run web servers, access it from the Internet... I've been absolutely and tremendously happy with this purchase. I just had to make a lifestyle change to get used to the music player. Not a big deal overall, and definitely not something that would keep me from recommending this product. Need a good NAS? Synology is your answer.ss it from the Internet...

This allows me to use it wirelessly as I want, and then plug it in when at the computer for extended use (sometimes 12 hours non-stop!).  It's comfortable, though a little heavy and large feeling at first until you adjust to it.  I do have two &#34;complaints&#34; but both really aren't faults.  The first is...the initial set up of this headset (for people who are picky about their sound quality) can be a touch time consuming as you set it for games, skype, movies, music etc getting it just right.<br /><br />The second concern however is a bit more of a nuisance.  I use a laptop and the dongle that connects to the USB for wireless use is not suited for laptops given it's length.  On a desktop CPU where you are not near your USB ports it would be fine...but on my laptop I have broken and had to replace the dongle twice from it catching on things during movement.

But those \\\\\"real\\\\\" books are just too difficult to manage while travelling. Using my laptop while in a cramped airline seat seemed to be just too much effort. So I pre-ordered the Kindle Fire after seeing the video on Amazon about it.<br /><br />My biggest dislike of any Kindle really has to do with Amazon. Amazon pulled some purchased content from owners in the past and that made me very WARY, so I have not been using my Kindle Fire to purchase books. Instead, I have used it to borrow books, play games, watch videos and read email.<br /><br />The day after my new Kindle Fire arrived, I was given an iPad *not an iPad 2* at work.<br /><br />Size - the Kindle Fire is smaller than the iPad and weighs much less. Most people won't notice the difference but if you have arthritis or other limiting issues, it might be a deciding factor.<br /><br />The thing I love the most about the Kindle is its size. I can toss it in to my purse. It is great for travel or sitting at the doctor's office.<br /><br />Screens - both the Kindle Fire and the iPad have beautiful color touch screens. The iPad has multi-touch functionality. Both touch screens are intuitive and have great pictures. Since the Kindle Fire is smaller, of course the view size is smaller.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire is really just an Amazon multimedia consumption device. If you are an Amazon Prime member, then you will love it. There is a lot of overlap between the two devices, but the iPad in the end has a lot more functionality.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire requires an active Wifi if you want to watch any video or access web content. But, there is the option to download some items on to the system so that you can use them while Wifi deficient.<br /><br />While the iPad has is no Flash capability, there really has only been one time that I encountered a problem with a website and flash.<br /><br />The iPad excels at many things: movie watching, game playing, book reading, checking in at work, editing documents, downloading apps, etc. If the current iPad 2 entry price is too high for you, go ahead and buy a second-hand original iPad for about the same cost as a Kindle Fire. The original iPad is actually quite awesome.<br /><br />Ease of use - my three year old has taken ownership of both the Kindle Fire and the iPad.

So, after a bit of searching I found a bolt of my own that fit and used that. After I got everything put together i also had to tighten a few bolts on the arms so that it wouldn't just point the screen down immediately.<br /><br />After it was put together and everything was tightened or replaced it's a very sturdy monitor stand and I am happy with it but could only bring myself to give it three stars since, it was after all missing the bolt.",

I use this device as the safe-source for all documents so I can access them from any home PC. I have never had problems connecting or accessing files, so it works great. I am even able to stream music video over the WLAN without problems.   2. Ample capacity - 2 TBs of storage is more than enough for the foreseeable future.  3. PS3 connectivity - I was pleasantly surprised when I purchased a PS3 that it automatically recognized this network hard drive as a media server. I can access all of our pictures, video, and MP3s from the PS3 in the living room, making it a nice home entertainment hub.

The front pocket where pens & other small elements are placed caused a bunch of scrapes on my hand when reaching down inside while the bag was full of my laptop, 2 textbooks, 1 or 2 notebooks, plus a folder or 2.  Additionally, I was very disappointed with the very small pockets which include a netting separator, which is completely USELESS! All it does is block the pocket from taking in all the items it could even possibly hold by half. If you put keys in there they get stuck, it was just a huge waste.  On top of that, the weight caused everything I placed in the bag to feel 2x heavier, which for someone who is disabled is a seriously negative quality.   The things I did like was the padding on the straps for the back pack was helpful, & there were some other good things, like the depths of the actual large compartments, allowing me to carry quite a bit of additional items, like extra water bottle & a container of fruit. But overall this bag, which starts out as a pretty impressively large pack that will hold a large 17\\\\\" screen -- but notice that the majority of reviews were written very early on by other owners of the bag.

I wish the case could of been much slimmer when it's closed it actually looks like you are carrying a light book around. But other then the snaggy look when carrying I think it's a great design and feels secured in your hand when you use the tablet.<br /><br />*******update******* after having this for about 4 months I got to the point where i just carry the skin around not the fold up part. It's just so clunky when comparing to other cases. It comes off looking like a small school text book.

Verizon told us they would charge an extra $6 a month to have the distinctive ring (which we would use for our home number) to go to a separate voicemail, then told us it wasn't available in our area at all!  So I was THRILLED that there was a machine out there that did this and I immediately purchased the 5500 after reading all the reviews. LOVE IT!  I didn't even read the manual - just plugged it in, called tech support, told them what I wanted to do, and within 5 minutes I was up and running - EASY!  What I did was have our distinctive ring go to the answering machine and the other ring (business line) go to voicemail.  What I like about it, too is that the first ring rings both phones, not just the one in my office.  So if I'm downstairs, I can hear it AND look on caller ID to see who is calling.  And what is also nice about it is that if it is a business call and I want it to go to voicemail, it will continue to ring in my office without my having to hear it throughout the house.  BUT, if I am downstairs and DO want to pick up, I don't have to run up to my office - I can do it because it's the same phone line!  And I love that the caller ID works on all the phones, whether it's plugged into the Comswitch or not.  I figured I paid one time to purchase this unit what it would cost MONTHLY to pay Verizon for an extra line.  Love it, love it, love it!!

With some more research, turns out that dual graphics don't enhance PS performance at all. And, the switchable graphics are buggy at best.

But that's consistent across recent MS design.<br />Other little things. The keyboard is not quite sensitive enough, but that takes some getting used to.

I don't expect much from laptop speakers, but if Dolby is going to tout their performance, then I'd expect more than the buzzfest that I got.<br />Soooooo, since this computer is practically unusable for my purposes, I'm returning it.",

At first, I thought the product didn't work, but after deciding to do a clean install on the new drive, I found that it worked with the old stock drive. When moving my user data to the new drive, I noticed the data rates were not very consistent. It was topping out at 30 MB/s but was spiking up and down while doing it. Either way, it worked relatively well.<br /><br />Honestly, even though I thought the product didn't work at first, I wasn't too heartbroken. It was $7 and it came with a nice plastic 2.5&#34; HDD case. There's lights on the SATA end that let you know if it has power and if it has access to the HDD, this ended up being very helpful for me. It is a USB 2.0, so it was a little slower like I mentioned earlier, but at a $7 price point it is hard to beat.<br /><br />All in all, it ended up working and being useful, just not in the way I originally planned for it. Price point is great too, even if it is USB 2.0. I can't justify 5 stars since it didn't work for my hybrid drive. I suspect this won't work for an SSD either.

They are, however, small and slightly unnatural for daily 8-hour shifts. The \\\\\"live long and prosper\\\\\" hand-hold you are forced to adopt to hold most mice (you know, thumb on the left, pointer and middle finger on the buttons, and the ring and little finger on the right side) produces strain on the ring and little fingers.<br /><br />What the mouse gets right is the angle and grip. Unfortunately, my hand was more than a knuckle-length off the edge of the mouse, making using the buttons even more unnatural to me than using a \\\\\"regular\\\\\" mouse. Speaking of buttons, the mouse I received had some sort of problem where the buttons weren't snapped in properly (or the design is just flawed in this way) causing the right mouse button's leading, pointed edge to dig into the underside of my fingers. To further the problem, each of the buttons had a plastic click before the actual micro-switch click. I kept thinking I had clicked the buttons, but it was just something inside causing a click, and I hadn't fully depressed the button at all!<br /><br />If you are trying to relieve some tension in your mousing hand, keep looking.

            "input": "I have had this laptop for 6 months since I had it. I got this refurbished because Dell was running a special on their refurbished business class laptops, and I needed a new laptop after 6 years with my old one. Due to this being refurbished, I am not mentioning the price. If you buy this, get it through Dell directly in some way. The Amazon sellers selling this are shady or they don't know what they're talking about with this particular laptop. You can probably consider this a buyers guide, too.<br /><br />After 6 months of owning this laptop, what are my thoughts on it? I think very favorably of the laptop, but there are some things you really need to know and the upgrades I consider essential. Like my SX150 review, I will handle this in sections.<br /><br />Processor:<br />With this laptop, you can get multiple processor choices. These are:<br />* Core i5<br />* Core i7 4600M<br />* Core i7 4610M<br />* Core i7 4800MQ<br />* Core i7 4810MQ<br /><br />My particular model has a 4800MQ processor. Dell has also switched processors in these very frequently so there are a lot of these out there with varying processors. If you want one of these, it's important to verify the installed processor before buying.<br />Also, a word of warning: Core i5 models generally lack dedicated video, as these use Intel graphics in most cases. Unless you have a Dell premier account, you need one of the i7 models for dedicated video. This isn't a deal breaker, but more or less something to be aware of.<br /><br />Personally, I have had both a 4600M and 4800MQ model of this laptop. Personally, if you're spending this kind of money on a laptop I would go ahead and get a i7 model instead. An i5 in a laptop this nice makes no sense, especially since Haswell runs cool in laptops now, unlike the days of the past with Intel i7 laptops.<br /><br />Personally, I think both the 4600M and 4800MQ are great processors for premium laptops. Unless you need a quad core processor for whatever reason, I would get it with a 4600M or 4610M. Quad cores in laptops only really make sense if you can justify having one.<br /><br />Battery<br />For this particular laptop, you can get 4 kinds of battery for it<br />* 60WHr 6 cell<br />* 65WHr 6 cell<br />* 97WHr 9 cell<br />* 87WHr 9 cell<br /><br />Now, let me tell you now that the 60WHr will not work well in this laptop. You're going to be plugging it in every 1-2 hours. If you have this battery, get rid of it as soon as you can. If you have the 65WHr(which I have), it's a little better. You'll get 4 hours at first, but once the battery starts to wear expect 2-3 hours out of this computer in most configurations. This started to happen when this battery jumped from 10 to 11% wear, and can't make it's mind up. Either way, this one will work decently but expecting it to last in this is a stretch. Keep multiple chargers if possible.<br /><br />Once we get to the 9 cell batteries you're in really good shape with this computer. My first one of these had a 97WHr battery. I got 5 hours or more out of this computer, and for a machine of this class that's impressive. You can also get a 87WHr 9 cell for it. With this you lose 10-15% of the capacity, but instead you get better quality cells and a 3 year warranty. This battery is optional equipment, though. Dell does not include this as a standard battery with any E6540. You can buy it as part of the laptop from Dell, or on it's own later on. The choice is yours. Due to this battery being optional equipment, I really can't say how long it will last. I don't think it diverts from 5 hours too much, though. Personally, I'd buy it separate from the laptop, but do it at the time of purchase if you get it refurbished. New ones come with the 97WHr battery. Before doing this, verify the battery in the listing. If it says 6 cell, buy the 9 cell.<br /><br />In short with the batteries you need to buy the right one for this laptop. The 6 cell 60WHr won't last, the 65WHr might last but it will dropin short order and you can get good runtimes out of the 9 cell variants. You really should buy it with a 9 cell battery for the best mobile experience. Dell's basic batteries have historically been garbage. This is no exception for the business laptops.<br /><br />Storage:<br />Dell has also changed this a lot with time. Older variants will probably come with a hard drive. You will know these by them being 2013 or Early 2014 models with some form of a platter drive. However, these can appear from Dell Premier purchases too. Late 2014 models come with a 256GB SSD standard now unless you change it with a Dell Premier account.<br />What does all of this mean? Well, it means you have a range of drive types you can run into. Personally, you want an SSD, otherwise you may want to add this later on. A SSD will really show in this laptop.<br />I have seen multiple variants for drives. You can see what I have seen with this laptop over time below.<br />* 320GB HDD<br />* 500GB HDD<br />* 500GB SSHD<br />* 1TB SSHD/HDD<br />* 128GB Mobility SSD<br />* 256GB Mobility SSD<br />Due to all these changes in drives, I am not listing what machines to expect these in. Verify the installed drive from the service tag on the laptop. Trust the seller, but scrutinize them at the same time. Like the Amazon sellers, they screw the hard drives up too. If you have a hard drive, this machine is going to run very slowly. You want a SSD in this laptop if possible.<br /><br />Memory:<br />These machines can have anywhere from 4 to 16GB of memory. If you buy one of the 4GB models, it's okay since you can upgrade the RAM. Don't stress too much, but get a good amount of RAM at the same time. I would suggest at least 8GB minimum.<br />Now that that's out of the way, a word of warning: THESE MACHINES NEED 1.3V DDR3 RAM! You can't use 1.5V RAM. The RAM you use in these is called DDR3L/LPDDR3. These names tend to be interchanged, so if you see either it's the same thing. But you need to check the operating voltage of the RAM before buying any for this laptop.<br />I don't know how true this is, but the i7 models MIGHT accept 32GB. Try it if you want, but Dell says 16GB. I have linked some compatible memory below.<br />[[ASIN:B00CQ35HBQ Kingston Technology 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L (PC3-12800) 1.35V Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM Intel Laptop Memory KVR16LS11/8]]<br /><br />In short: You can get these with anywhere from 4-16GB of RAM. You also don't need to stress about it, since the RAM isn't soldered. But bear in mind standard DDR3 running at 1.5V will not work and you need DDR3L. For this reason I would strongly advise buying the RAM yourself, or asking someone who knows what to get on what RAM is compatible and runs at 1.3V.<br /><br />Display:<br />You have 2 choices for a display. 1366x768 or 1920x1080. The choice is yours here, but 1080p is the way to go in my opinion. The reason being is practicality. Low res displays tend to not work so well with multiple windows, go getting the 1080p version is advisable. Both panels are matte.<br /><br />Trackpad:<br />I can't say I'm thoroughly impressed with the trackpad on this laptop. Part of the reason for this is I think Dell could have made it larger, but still kept it practical. You also can't invert the scrolling in the driver, so you have to adjust to smartphone like scrolling. Once you get used to it, it's fine. If the size of the trackpad bothers you, nothing a mouse doesn't fix at least. But it is usable, albeit a little tiny for the size of the laptop. At the same time it isn't a clickpad, though. Yes, I'm talking to you Lenovo.<br />In the newest driver revision you should have traditional scrolling back. Well, at least in my case. You will have to remove the driver, clean the registry with a registry cleaner and then install it as a fresh driver to have similar luck.<br /><br />Keyboard:<br />These have solid keyboards, and they make all these consumer grade ones I used feel as bad as they are. It's also harder to make a mistake on it, because of how the keys aren't flat like consumer grade laptops. And yes, it really does make a difference. You will find backlit and non backlit models. Get it with the backlit keyboard.<br /><br />Webcam:<br />In laptops webcams are often a afterthought. This is kind of the case in this one, but it's not as bad as others out there. The mics do sound good, and quite frankly the mic is more important in a laptop. You can also buy it without the webcam if you wish.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I have really come to like this laptop, despite it's shortcomings with the trackpad and the fact this one came with a hard drive and not a SSD.<br />The reason I gave this a four star review is how Dell has these set up for private buyers. Dell has one model that is undesirable and I would not touch. This model is the version with Intel graphics, a Core i5, 4GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive. It also has the 1366x768 screen. This model is not worth it and you're better off spending the extra money on a better model.<br />Currently Dell has two to choose from. These are:<br />Core i5 4310M<br />Win7 Pro<br />15.6\\\\\" 1366x768<br />4GB DDR3L<br />320GB HDD<br />HD Graphics 4600<br />This model is 1049.00. This is the model I would avoid.<br /><br />Core i7 4610M<br />15.6\\\\\" 1920x1080<br />8GB DDR3L<br />256GB Mobility SSD<br />AMD 8790M/Intel HD Graphics<br />This model is 1718.00<br /><br />If you can get the i7 model, get that version instead. You'll be much happier with it.<br /><br />Well, I hope you found this review useful. If you get a good one and not a lower end model, this is a very nice laptop and is well worth the money.ting voltage of the RAM before buying any for this laptop.<br />I don't know how true this is, but the i7 models MIGHT accept 32GB.

Dell has one model that is undesirable and I would not touch. This model is the version with Intel graphics, a Core i5, 4GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive. It also has the 1366x768 screen. This model is not worth it and you're better off spending the extra money on a better model.<br />Currently Dell has two to choose from. These are:<br />Core i5 4310M<br />Win7 Pro<br />15.6\\\\\" 1366x768<br />4GB DDR3L<br />320GB HDD<br />HD Graphics 4600<br />This model is 1049.00. This is the model I would avoid.<br /><br />Core i7 4610M<br />15.6\\\\\" 1920x1080<br />8GB DDR3L<br />256GB Mobility SSD<br />AMD 8790M/Intel HD Graphics<br />This model is 1718.00<br /><br />If you can get the i7 model, get that version instead. You'll be much happier with it.<br /><br />Well, I hope you found this review useful. If you get a good one and not a lower end model, this is a very nice laptop and is well worth the money.",

I was sick of turning the a/c down to the point where I was freezing (which takes a lot...I tend to keep my house pretty cold...my dogs hate it), so I was trying to find a lapdesk he would actually use.  So far he's hated the three I've tried, probably since he tends to hate lapdesks in general.  I saw this one -and it was going to be the last one I tried, and I'm so glad I did!!  He has used it ever since - despite the 'you wasted money' look on his face when I showed it to him.<br /><br />He forgot it home this past weekend when he was traveling, and after he got home earlier today I realized I need to buy myself one since I really didn't want to give it back to him.  It's super comfortable to use - no bulkiness that you usually experience with these - and while neither of use a mouse, the slide out was still really useful for me since I could rest my notepad there while working & use it to jot down quick notes.<br /><br />It fits his 15\\\\\" macbook pro (ancient...but I think it's still pretty close to the same sizes as the current macbook pro's) and of course it easily fits my 13\\\\\" macbook pro.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to do much for the heat - but I wasn't expecting it to since none of the lapdesks I've ever used with a solid plastic surface ever do.

Because of this it appears to have a few minor flaws that may have been fixed by the GT701R. Nonetheless, there may be workarounds for these.<br /><br />The second thing about this modem is that it's a Qwest-branded modem, with Qwest firmware. Qwest was acquired by CenturyLink several years ago, so I hope this does not cause a problem. However, the Qwest firmware does provide a QoS feature that may be useful for certain traffic management scenarios.<br /><br />The one thing I required from this modem is a USB interface for the way I network my two computers - saves having to purchase an external router.

Even without the fans it will give your laptop that breathing room needed, just be sure to remove the fans to allow for more airflow.<br /><br />Edit 12-6-2012: Ok, it's been about 3 months and it was still bugging me that the fan was rattling, thus not letting me use the fans to cool the laptop. So I read around on ways to solve this problem and I found a solution that suggested using [[ASIN:B0083V8H0I WD-40 110054 Multi-Use Product Spray with Smart Straw, 8 oz.]] while this isn't the same model I used it's still the same product. So, I pulled back the affected fan a little bit to be able to spray into the bearings with the nozzle. I cleaned it up, plugged it in and now it works like before no rattling, YESS!<br /><br />This might be only a temporary fix to my problem but for now I can actually use the fans again so I'm satisfied.

I haven't called Toshiba tech support yet and I'm sure it's covered by a warranty, but it's still unacceptable for such a product as an external hard drive to be of such a poor quality.

Last time though I left it plugged in and put my computer into the sleep mode. Right away I heard a clicking noise coming from the enclosure. Not thinking about it much, I simply pulled the USB cable out. 2 weeks later I was about to do another backup. I plugged the drive in and, as you might've already read this in other reviews, my computer refused to recognize it as a drive. I tried plugging it into 2 other laptops with same results.    P.S. Toshiba replaced the failed drive. No charge, I had to pay for shipping though. Thus I've upped the score from 1 to 2 stars just to be fair.   After the initial experience, I now make sure I disconnect the drive before shutting down my computer. And I don't think I'll be carrying this thing around with me just in case, so portability is out of question.",

I figured it was just a random error so I unplugged and plugged it again and it got back to working.<br />But then it stopped again. I tried inserting different drives (I have 3 different hard drives from different manufacturers) - with all of them the same thing happened: I got anotification of a usb malfunction and I had to either unplug or even worse - restart the pc, in order to get the drives identified again.<br />I even went as far as to format the hard drives, thinking naively that maybe the issue was with the hard drives and not the docking station.

I just stumbled upon it and thought it might help some folks who have had difficulty getting good signal strength and speed from this router (while others have had great success).    I installed this router the other day in my home. I have an older iMac, older MacBook, new iPhone 3Gs, and a new iPod Touch on the new network. The signal strength and speed was very good (obviously much better than before with a 54 Mbps Netgear router). So I was happy with that.    But I also have a new Dell laptop with Windows XP Professional for my full-time home office up in the attic (three floors from the router). The signal strength up there was now not very good, and the speed, which previously was 54 Mbps, or very close, actually fell below 20 Mbps at times. I called D-Link support, which was fast and professional (and free). They had me make some simple changes to values in two fields within the Advanced Wireless tab of the router setup screen (using router IP address and a web browser on the network). This helped, but much less than I had hoped. They did tell me not to update the firmware, BTW, from what my router shipped with.    After the call ended, I was looking through the tabs in the router setup from my web browser and decided to turn On the Guest Network, which by default is Off. I did so using the same SSID as my main network, but added a number at the end. It also has WPA Security, and is on 24 hours a day, and I did not check the box enabling access with the other network. When I closed out of the router set up screen (and the router reboots by itself) the signal strength shot up dramatically and the speed was now at 130 Mbps in the attic. The speed fluctuates between 78 and 130 daily, which is fine by me. This second network is 2.4 Ghz (not sure what the main network is).    Now I use the Mac hardware on the main network, and my Dell laptop for work on thesecond network. This fix worked out great for me, hopefully it helps someone else!",

I plugged it in charged it back up to 100% and it happened again at 60%! I contacted bestdigitalbuy and said my product seemed to be defective. They replied back quickly and with a solution! The BIOS settings for the battery needed to be updated. I followed the steps that they gave me and BAM! Just like that my tablet was functioning properly and running down to 0% like it should.    BIOS BATTERY SOLUTION (THANKS TO BESTDIGITALBUY)  [...]    FINAL THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS  I love this tablet and it is the perfect alternative for a new windows 8 tablet. Though it does not come with windows 8 installed you can install it yourself and it runs smooth and great. Not to mention it is 400-600 dollars cheaper than the new ones. It also comes with the keyboard dock for fast typing and easier use of microsoft office programs. In the end you get an amazing full windows tablet for the price of a low end 16gb iPad.

I close the top window of several stacked full screen windows, the mouse or trackball decides to close 3 (the close buttons being one under the other).  I position the cursor in a text (1 click), the trackball selects a word (double click).  I am a software tester, during manual (not automated) testing this hardware problem often causes unwanted effects.<br /><br />When new the trackball was very light to move.  I could &#34;throw&#34; the cursor from one side to the other with a quick thumb movement.  With time the ball moves more difficult, I cannot throw it anymore.  It requires several movements of my thumb to get the cursor over the screen.  I have to take out the ball, wrap it with a soft cloth and carefully clean the contact points (support points) inside the housing, and it will be better again, but never like new, and more frequent cleaning is required every time to keep the ball rolling.<br /><br />It's also more difficult to do precision work with the trackball (selecting text with very small font, working in Photoshop).  A mouse is better there.<br /><br />The only advantage of the trackball is that it puts less strain on my wrist.  Until now I don't have thumb problem.

So she takes it to school twice a week and it spends some time in the outside pocket of her backpack. There are no books sitting on it or anything which would cause it harm. She reads from it one day and sets it on shelf then picks it up and the screen is cracked. It will not unlock and is totally worthless. We have no children and have had no guests over to blame. So I call amazon thinking they could do something. So after talking to 3 different reps and being told they can\u2019t do anything (after it broke from 1 months use), I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told the supervisors were busy and would call me back. That didn\u2019t happen. My wife got a hold of a supervisor online and was told the same thing. \u201cSorry we can\u2019t help you on that devise, but you can buy another one for a little less\u201d.

This is a HUGE flaw and I almost considered returning it after this finding.    - The key layout is not acceptable to me. The function key is where control should be, making the commonly used control +tab, w, and t awkward. Shift, tab, and control should all go along the left side so your fingers can easily find them. How often do I need to engage the (sad excuse for a) number pad? One more thing. The function key ONLY enables the number pad. There are no other functions. Why not get rid of the function key and replace it with a number lock key?    - The touchpad is very dumb. I assumed that the scroll feature would work as it does on laptops, where if you move up and down on the rightmost side it would automagically know that you want to scroll. Not so, instead the right side of the touchpad is a permanent scroll bar. Go anywhere near it during normal operation, and it likes to scroll. You learn to use only the left side of the touchpad, but still very lame.    - I think it shipped with nearly dead batteries. The first set only lasted a few days.

I have a lot to say about this device and it is all good. My friends and I are in a Xbox clan and we like to make montages of our gameplay, and I love to commentate. To do this we have to record gameplay onto our computer and edit the footage or make a voice-over(for commentaries). We usually have to use 2-3 programs. One to record, and sometimes only iMovie but sometimes Final Cut Pro and Adobe After Effects. In our clan, 3 of us have a Happauge and one has an EyeTV. We have come to find that the EyeTV hardware sucks for this process because you have to buy about 10 different splitters which can create a lag between what your Xbox is doing, and what your TV is showing. We also found that despite the terrible hardware, the software was outstanding. If you have that program up, and you just forgot to record your gameplay, you can go back through  what you just played and record it. Does that make sense? I'm not sure you can check out the EyeTV software on your free time. ANYWAY. We also realized Happauge's software is for PC. We all have macs. EyeTV software is for macs so we downloaded that legally (although we thought about the torrent) and it even has a hardware list to choose your device on and Happauge is on it! To conclude, buy the Happauge, and get the EyeTV software.",

The one this replaced was about 4 years old and I had lost the drivers for it, but was still able to use it with the M$ BT stack.  This one beats it in every way other than it's class 2 vs class 1.  This was no big deal for me since my priority was throughput over range.  I mainly use it to tether my phone to my laptop for EVDO service.  My old adapter would only connect at 1.0 Mbps.  Not bad, but it was bottlenecking my speed.  This adapter connects at 2.1 Mbps, so the actual connection is faster and I'm sure the EDR helps with the throughput.  The adapter says it will connect up 3.0 Mbps, so I guess my phone tops out at 2.1.  It says it also supports Sactternet and connections with up to 7 other active slave devices.  I haven't had a chance to test this feature yet, but would come in handy if I were to also use a headset, A2DP, mouse, and keyboard at the same time.      Range seems about right.  I got about 30ft (and that's with 2 walls and a washer/dryer in between) before the connection became intermittent.  For those wondering why this is not a class 1 it's probably because there is trade-off when it comes to range.  You can ether have more range or more throughput at the expense of the other.  I don't think there are any class 1 adapters that are also v2 + EDR.    I noticed someone else say that it did not just work out of the box.  For it to just work, it would have to be compatible with M$'s BT stack (I don't know if this one is, I didn't even try it).  Even if it worked, I've always found M$'s BT stack to be a little lacking in features and settings.  If you get this, do yourself a favor and use it with the included drivers (which are Widcomm 5.1, btw).  Important thing with BT drivers is to run the install shell before connecting the adapter.  Just follow the instructions, they are refreshingly very clear.      Supported Profiles:  DUN, FAX, BPP, LAP, SPP, GAP, HID, HCRP, FTP, OPP, A2DP, GAVDP, HSP, PAN,BIP, SYNC, AV, GOEP    Pros:  - Price  - BT v2.0 + EDR  - Supports Scatternet and up to 7 ACTIVE slave devices  - Uses Widcomm 5.1 drivers (versus Blue Sol that usually comes with cheaper adapters)    Cons:  - Class 2  - Does not come with a cap (IMO, just another thing to lose, and mine stays plugged in anyway)    I'm ordering 2 more to replace my other adapters :)",

What I can tell you though is that this board is sturdy, well made the joints on it work perfectly, no loose parts, heavy with everything well placed and secured. If you do everything right the first time there shouldn't be any problems at post. Drivers available at the website are current and ready for Windows 7 and this is one stable board by all means, system temperature never goes past the 40 C even though room temperature is usually around 26 to 28 C.  Paired it with an [[ASIN:B003FVNC0Q AMD Phenom II X6 1055T Thuban 2.8 GHz 6x512 KB L2 Cache Socket AM3 125W Six-Core Processor - Retail HDT55TFBGRBOX]] and would probably get the [[ASIN:B002QG2H7K Corsair Cooling Hydro Series H50 All in One High-performance CPU Cooler CWCH50-1]] to do some very mild overclocking, also 2 kits of [[ASIN:B002N19KAK Kingston HyperX 4 GB Kit (2x2 GB Modules) 1600 MHz DDR3 Desktop Memory KHX1600C8D3K2/4GX]] and there was no problem at all with the BIOS reading everything correctly. I suggest you get a SATA 3 hard drive to take advantage of the onboard SATA3. If you are a gamer such as myself you already know that you need a separate video card, if you're not then the onboard video should be enough for even some 720p videos but I haven't tested it yet  The only con I can think of is the lack of USB ports at the back, I've used all the ports including the USB 3.0 ports for my devices (yes the USB 3.0 can work with USB 2.0 devices but you get 2.0 speeds) and even then I still need about 3 more ports at the back.

At first, honestly, want that amped about the Navy cover color, and why I had paid extra (in all reality, about the cost of a cup of Starbucks coffee) for it, over the standard, cheaper, black version. But, now that I've have had it a bit, the color has really grown on me, therefore I'm glad I spent the extra few dollars. I can spot my tablet with ease (not that it's day-glow colored) amongst a veritable sea of black cased electronics.<br /> The only knock I have on it, which isn't hive to me, but might be very important to some, is that it's not the most stable with the cover as a stand. This is due to the fact (which I like and use mine 90% of the time flat on its back), is the cover is very supple. I like this as it sits right on the screen, and I wouldn't want any hard material knocking against the glass.<br />The fit is absolutely perfect. It was made for this tablet. I wish all of my covers, albeit my iPad Retina Lifeproof N\u00fc\u00fcd fits impeccably, fit this good, and at this price point.<br />So, bottom line.....if you're looking for a great fit, protective case, at a great price.....look no further. Buy this case. If you're looking for more of a &#34;kickstand&#34;, all plastic case, still look at this, but the case is a whole lot better than just a plastic, fairly good fitting &#34;kickstand&#34;.

Not as good as a headset like the Turtle Beach X12, but good enough for gaming.<br /><br />MICROPHONE: The microphone on this headset seems to be good quality, my friends tell me they can hear me clearly. I also like how it's short and folds back in the headset.<br /><br />COMFORT: I'm guessing these are supposed to be over-ear headphones (meaning the earcups cover over your ears, not press against them), but the size of the earcups are so small that people with bigger ears like me might find them uncomfortable. The main reason for this is because the padding is thin and not very cushion-y. After just 30-40 mins of gaming, I started feeling slight pain on my ears. If comfort is your #1 priority, these might not be the best choice for you.<br /><br />QUALITY: From what I feel, this headset is fairly sturdy, and shouldn't break easy if you treat them with care (meaning don't throw them at your wall or step on them.). The cables seem to be of decent quality, and the volume control on the cord works well.<br /><br />TL;DR<br /><br />For the low price, this headset sounds good and the mic is good, but it's not the most comfortable if you have big ears or if comfort is your #1 priority when it comes to buying headsets. Should mainly be bought as a temporary headset until you can afford a nicer headset.",

Also, one of the reasons I purchased this laptop was because I thought the touchpad was going to be like a mac - click with one finger or click with two fingers for right click, spread fingers to zoom, multiple fingers to scroll - but it doesn't. The spread fingers to zoom does work, but there is a small area at the bottom to right click and small area to left click. However, with no raised button, it's difficult to tell where this area is unless you're looking at it instead of the screen. I also can't get scroll to work for me. AND, the pad is so extremely sensitive that the slightest brush of your palm/wrist while typing will end up accidentally cutting/pasting or moving the cursor. Also very frustrating.

I admit I was skeptical about the 100% bubble free guarantee, but it delivers.  The rigid shape of the protector is the key I believe.  It applied perfectly on the first try, and I just let my 3 year old have at it.  I expected to see the normal fingerprints (and I was planning on just washing the screen and re-applying) but they aren't there.  I took it off and washed it anyway, just to test that out, and it reapplied just as well (I let it dry for about 20 minutes before re-applying).  Same result as before! No bubbles, and it stuck on great! And it looks great.  I have a black Ipad, and the black outline matches perfectly.    This is a great product at a great price! I highly recommend it! The only thing I don't like about this product is the instructions.  It is simply 3 pictures with little text.  (Very similar to IKEA furniture instructions).  It's very self explanatory, but it would be nice to know a little more , (ie how many washes it can handle and still stick, what to do if it doesn't adhere correctly, etc.).

After a week though, the speed would drop to less than 2 mbps. I would have to reset the modem and the speed returned to 130 's again.  This went on for a couple weeks.  At first, it was daily, eventually every 2 -3 hours.  I contacted ARRIS customer support.  They ran some tests on the modem and assured me my modem was fine and passed the blame onto the cable provider.  I had several technicians from cable company come out to trouble shoot.  They ended up replacing my line from the main box in the street to my box on my lawn.  Then, the line from the box on my lawn to the  box on my house.  Eventually replacing the line in my house upto the modem.  They also replaced the components in these  boxes.  After about the 15 visits and 2 months later, with the cable company insisting that it was a problem with my modem and ARRIS insisting that it was the cable company, I listened to my wife's advice.  I hooked up my old sb141 modem.  Now I am getting 140 mbps downloads consitently.  ARRIS has managed to drag this along for over 30 days so I can't return the modem.<br /><br />On a brighter note I have brand new cable lines run from the main box in road into my house.<br /><br />I have been a strong supporter of the SURFboard modems for 4-5 years, starting with the  sb121, then the sb141 and then sb 161.  I have never had a problem with them until the sb183.  The sb141 was probably the best modem they made.  Product quality have suffered since they were taken over by ARRIS.  Customer support is disappointing.  If you own the sb141 keep it and don't waste your money upgrading to sb183.  If you are looking to buy a modem, get the sb141 and hope that is does not break, because ARRIS does not stand behind their product..

I would also suggest buying a little padded case with a shoulder strap for your iPad2, cords and accessories, that provides a little more protection and you can place this separate case in your backpack and/or just pull it out when you run to the coffee shop or out for errands and you don't want to lug around a huge backpack.

Myself and several friends used to play tag at the local roller rink, however this was becoming a bit pricey to do regularly. This was one of the first sets of guns that we located online, and decided to give them a shot because of the high reviews. We have not been disappointed. We typically play at the local park, so we've really stress tested these guns. I would highly recommend if you can get a group of people interested (at least 4 is ideal).    Range:  Guns allow for team or solo play. Range is surprisingly good. We are able to consistently get hundreds of feet (easily 300+) of precision and accuracy even in bright daylight. We can basically target each other from opposite ends of the clearing at the center of our park.    Feel/durability:  Guns have a good, solid feel and weight is good. You don't feel like you are going to break them during normal use. We play with 3-5 sets of guns, and no one has had any serious malfunction over the course of the first year. Battery life is also surprisingly good. I would have expected to eat batteries, but even with cheap batteries you will get (at least) weeks of life.    Gameplay:  Solo or team battle (2 selectable teams). Guns are loud and bright which ads to the experience. Reloading adds a degree of realism: you have to eject the cartridge from the handle and then push it back into the gun. Guns rumble when you are hit, and have a slight recoil when you shoot. Gun holds six shots at a time and life can be set at 10 or 25 hits. LED meters on both sides of the gun show you how much ammo you currently have loaded, and how much life you have left. Guns announce your elimination when you run out of life.    Extras:  We have the scope and shotgun attachments as well. Scope is OK (it's a matter of personal preference). It has a cross-hair and a laser that lines up to show you where you are shooting. Shotgun attachment is a great addition. You can shoot normally through the shotgun, or you can pump the attachment for a shot blast. Shot blast gives you a much wider angle of dispersal, and if you are accurate one shot blast can register both on multiple enemies and on individuals more than once (up to three hits per shot, I believe). Shotgun is also hot-swappable in game.    I'm not sure if this line has been discontinued. It's getting harder to find new (at the time of writing amazon has none in stock). I hope that we can start seeing guns/attachments on store shelves again sometime! New attachment choices would also be nice.",

The Classic Pen is smaller, lighter and more comfortable to hold and draw with than the bulky stylus that comes with the Intuos 4 and Cintiq 12WX. The rounded shape of the switch makes it more comfortable to use when compared with the squared edges of the original, as well.<br /><br />Two minor things kept me from giving this 5 stars. First, and this is the same with the original stylus, the nib seats far too deeply into the stylus. I think another millimeter or two of protrusion would make it perfect. Nibs would last a little bit longer and it would feel more natural to draw with.<br /><br />The second is that my Wacom drivers know the difference between this stylus and the original, which may be fine, but I had to re-map my preferences, shortcuts, radial menus and all for use with this stylus. And, thanks to Wacom's track record with drivers, this meant I had to uninstall and reinstall the drivers (version 6.3.6-3, the newest drivers available at the time). That probably shouldn't factor in to the rating of this stylus and is more an issue with Wacom drivers generally. Just be prepared to reconfigure all of this stuff if you buy the stylus.<br /><br />In all, everything works and I'm happy and more comfortable digitally painting and sculpting with the Classic Pen. I understand that people's preferences may differ, but if you find the original stylus clunky to use and somewhat uncomfortable, this is the answer.",

You don't have to use the RFID tag, you can just set up a password, but the RFID is easy to use and only adds a second or so to the connect process. Just make sure you have made a note of the RFID key, should you lose the tag. The drive has a built in virtual CD drive feature. This allows you to boot into a windows image or run diagnostic tools if needed. I like the data destroy feature as well. As a test, I created a windows backup using separate software, Acronis, and used the drive to perform a restore. I then used the self-destruct feature to wipe the drive securely. I tried a lot of different data recovery tools with no success. So if I ever really need to do a secure wipe, I know it will work. The only real con I have and it's just a minor nitpick, is the touchscreen interface. When not using a stylus, I feel like I kind of need to tap harder than I should. Other than that it always seems to get what I selected right. The price may seem a bit high, but if your job involves you needing to take work data back and forth, then this drive is just right.

I paid over $600.00 for a quality piece of electronics that, by the way, I use constantly and thankfully, IT works as advertised.  At least you could have provided a clear plastic insert for the goofy \\\\\"Hole\\\\\" In back.

However, because my most important factor is maximum battery life, I ended up returning this battery and purchased a much more expensive Duracell brand replacement battery instead.<br />After following their instructions for initially calibrating the battery, and after 3 full discharge/charge cycles, the maximum time I could get out of this battery was 2 hours 29 minutes. Not bad for less than $40 (including shipping), but I wanted better than that. Before returning this battery, I purchased a Duracell battery (just over $100) to do a comparison. After the same calibration method, I'm getting 3 hours and 20 minutes from the Duracell.<br />So, more than twice the price for not quite an extra hour of battery life? For me, yes, it's definitely worth it. For you, maybe not. If you don't care about maximum battery life, then I would say this is a good battery at an affordable price. And the company (BTExpert) is very easy to work with. They got back to me right away, and gave me no problems about the return.<br />A Note About 12 Cell Batteries \u2014 If you are unfamiliar with these, the standard battery with most laptops is a 6 cell battery, and fits flush with the bottom of the laptop. the 12 cell in theory doubles your battery capacity (I've unfortunately never found this to be the case), and it also raises the back of the laptop off the table about a half inch. It might look a little funny, but I actually really like this &#34;feature&#34;. The cant makes it easier to type, and the extra airspace helps keep the laptop cool.",

The end result looks very good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Comes with lint removal cloth<br />-Easy to use, rigid squeegee to push out bubbles<br />-Several pieces of tape to remove lint and dust particles from the underside of film while applying THIS IS A BIG DEAL and it's the first I've seen with this addition...<br /><br />Cons:<br />NO INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED so if you haven't applied one of these before you'll be lost and need to search on-line for how-to<br />Protective film only on ONE side. This is an issue because the squeegee applies pressure to the upper surface of the protector and can, if pressed with enough pressure mar the finish of the protector's surface.<br /><br />QUICK HOW TO APPLY INSTRUCTIONS:<br /><br />WHAT YOU'LL NEED:<br />a) One wide piece of baking parchment paper (18 inches) cut to a length of about 24 inches OR two pieces of standard width waxed paper cut to 24 inches long.<br />b) Some spray cleaner for eye glasses is nice but you can window cleaner IF  you don't use too much (really just a spritz on a paper towel will do.<br />c) All the pieces from this kit laid out on the work surface (see step 1, below)<br /><br />APPLYING THE SCREEN PROTECTOR (DON'T TOUCH THE STICKY SURFACE WITH YOUR FINGERS)<br />1) Do this on a dust free (or relatively so) surface. That means don't do it on top of your table cloth. Do it on a table top or counter top.<br />2) Wipe the table or counter top with a slightly damp cloth to remove dust particles then dry it with a piece of heavy paper towel.<br />3) Spread out a piece of wide baking parchment paper or two overlapping pieces of waxed paper (this is your work surface)<br />4) Take another paper towel and spritz it VERY LIGHTLY (half a spray or less) and wipe the iPad's screen and case. Get rid of all the smudges, dust and finger prints and be sure the screen is as dry as possible--completely dry is best.<br />5) Using the same paper towel, wipe the top of the screen protector sheet lightly and make sure it's dry. Do the same to the side that you will peel back before adhering the protector to the iPad's screen. This gets rid of stray dust particles and a bit of the static that builds up on the screen protector sheet.<br />6) Lay the iPad screen facing up onto the parchment or waxed paper surface and wipe the screen gently and completely with the dust removal cloth from the package. Be sure to get rid of any dust you can see (there's some you cannot see--more on that later)<br />7) Pick up the protector sheet and grab the tab with the number 1 printed on it.<br />8) Gently pull back about half an inch to one inch of this protective covering to reveal the adhesive side that will be placed against the iPad's screen.<br />9) Place this uncovered section on the iPad's screen at the correct end (remember--the camera hole and home button hole do go an specific ends so do this correctly.<br />10) At this time there may be some bubbles between the sheet and iPad screen. Gently push them out with the squeegee. It's easier to do this when you catch them near the edge that is just beginning to adhere. You can always pull the protector up a bit to get rid of bubbles.<br />11) PATIENTLY AND SLOWLY keep pulling the protective sheet back and off of the stick side of the protector sheet, laying the protector down a little at a time and using the squeegee to push out bubbles as you go.<br /><br />THE TOUGH PART---<br />THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME MICROSCOPIC DUST PARTICLES THAT FIND THEIR WAY BETWEEN THE SCREEN AND THE PROTECTOR SHEET. THIS IS WHEN YOU USE THE DUST REMOVAL TAPE STRIPS.<br /><br />A DUST PARTICLE CAN LOOK LIKE A BUBBLE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE PARTICLE IS 3 DIMENSIONAL AND AIR DOES SURROUND IT. YOU CANNOT SQUEEGEE THEM OUT.<br /><br />THESE PARTICLES STICK TO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PROTECTOR SHEET NOT TO THE iPad SCREEN.<br /><br />DO STEP 12 BELOW IF YOU HAVE DUST PARTICLES.<br /><br />12) Get a piece of the dust removal tape-pull it off the sheet it ships on. Hold it with the stick side up. LIFT the screen protector sheet just high enough to get the piece of tape under the protector sheet until you think you're in the correct spot. Stick the end of the tape strip to the underside of the protector and then pull it away. This should remove the dust particle IF you carefully noted the location of the dust particle. This part takes a while and can be frustrating. I learned to live with two or three because some just won't go away. IF A DUST PARTICLE will not come off with the supplied tape, try some scotch tape or a short piece of clear packaging tape-the adhesive is a bit stronger and can pull particles off that the tape strip included in the package will not. Fold over one end so you don't stick it completely onto the sheet as doing so will force you to use another protector.<br /><br />13) Keep removing the protective sheet, laying the sticky side down onto the iPad's screen, using the squeegee to push out bubbles and the tape to remove microscopic (almost dust particles).<br />14) Finally the entire protective sheet will lay flat on the iPad's screen. Use the squeegee to push out any remaining bubbles.<br />15) Use the dust removal cloth from the kit to buff out any smudging caused by over zealous use of the squeegee.<br /><br />Final note: The whole process takes at least 30 minutes and can take up to 45 to do carefully and properly to produce a result that is bubble free and has as few dust particles between the protector and screen. Take your time, be patient. Have a stiff drink AFTER your done.br /><br />12) Get a piece of the dust removal tape-pull it off the sheet it ships on. Hold it with the stick side up.

I gave up and put all the pieces back in place before completely breaking the thing (BTW, it does have a small/quiet CPU fan with heat pipes connected to the GPU I think -- it's still virtually silent from a foot or so away).  After all, a 750GB 5400RPM drive is not too shabby for a system with such a sluggish CPU.<br /><br />After giving up on the SSD option, I installed Ubuntu Server 11.10 64-bit on it (a Linux distribution).  The ethernet and wireless drivers were recognized automatically.  I've only used the ethernet drivers but have no reason to believe that the wireless wouldn't work.  I haven't tried the audio drivers either... that might be more tricky, but I didn't need audio for this purpose.  Audio did work fine over HDMI when using it as a HTPC.  So far everything that I need works great as a low-power home server.  It seems to do a good job of switching from 800MHz to 1.3GHz when extra CPU power is needed.  Don't get me wrong -- it's still slow.  But at least I've found it a purpose, and it has pretty nice industrial design.  eSATA would be a nice addition though.  I don't like the crazy keyboard/mouse pad thing that it came with though... to each their own, but it's alien to those of us who type on regular keyboards on a daily basis.  It also had range of less than 15ft, although there is a lot of interference at 2.4GHz here.<br /><br />TL;DR It's too slow for most HTPC usage.  It uses very little power but it comes at a cost.  Don't try replacing the HD.  It's not silent, but it's very close.  Included keyboard/mouse combo is weird.  It's pretty good as a slow-ish home server, but that wasn't its intended purpose.",

I've used desktops, laptops, tablets, etc. but this is the first time I've used this type of computer and I absolutely love it.  The touchscreen is awesome and it is large, vibrant and bright.  I would compare the quality to my retina iPad, it really is that nice.  The response of the touchscreen is good and it also has a wireless mouse and keyboard which I am trying to leave off to the side to get a better for feel the All-in-One Touchscreen's original purpose.  This is also my second Computer with Windows 8.1 and I must say it is so much easier with the touchscreen.  I have been frustrated with my desktop that runs Windows 8.1 using a keyboard and mouse, the swipes and hidden things are annoying.  There are versions of this AiO without the touchscreen and I really recommend spending the extra $50 or so on the touchscreen version.  It really is what sets this apart from an average computer.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is equipped with the Celeron processor so it is not lightning fast but it has performed flawlessly.  I've really been impressed with this machine.  No internet lag, we've watched videos, full length movies and even our cable TV through an app with no intermediate buffering or freezing.  We've loaded apps and games for the kids and they enjoy it as well.  For a entry level computer, Dell has really nailed it here.  We got this on a lightning deal so the price was rediculously cheap.<br /><br />As far as setup goes, it was up and running in about 3 minutes.  One cord plugged into the wall for power and pop in the tiny USB for the wireless mouse and keyboard.  It connected to WiFi instantly and then it was time to start loading my e-mail, calendars, favorite apps, Internet favorites, etc.  Once you get everything going, give yourself a few hours for Windows Updates to do its thing.  The initial updates can be slow and its likely a combinationof the slower Celeron processor and Windows 8.1 quirks.  It will take some time and you'll likely have some download errors.  Be patient and after couple of restarts and forcing the search for updates you will get through the tedious process.  It's a minor annoyance that doesn't warrant a star deduct in my opinion because after the updates it's been perfect.<br /><br />This 5-star rating takes into account the value, speed and experience with a basic computer in a home environment.  If you are looking for a high-speed gaming computer, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a great value on a computer for regular computer activities, this is the one.",

I have had the new blade for close to a month now replacing my old laptop... The old blade. I can tell you with experience as a laptop gamer (alienware m15x, Asus g52 and asus g73 prior to the original blade) this laptop is awesome, it gives you everything you want/expect from a gaming laptop, the biggest downside still being as with the old blade, the price. however at $300 less than the debut price of the original blade it is a step in the right direction for razer to give the customers more bang for you buck. For those of you laptop gamers like myself 17 inch display is the only way to go and the blades display is amazing, very bright, very colorful matte finish with no glare. I really like that razer truly listened to its customers and its critics about the old blade, everything people said was wrong with it or bad about it, razer addressed one way or another, even if not exactly the best way (or the way I hoped for), but they still addressed it for example, storage space (old blade 256g SSD) they doubled the storage space on the new one (500g HDD 64g SSD). I would have really preferred a 512 SSD. However they did address the issue of storage while doing the best to maintain performance with their caching software to the SSD for frequently accessed files. Performance is still impressive with program load times and boot time, however i think the old blade still held a slight edge with its ssd. More examples of issues addressed and fixed with the new blade; lid mechanism much improved, built in speakers clearly better, the secondary functions on the f keys are now backlit, fans are much quieter, all USB ports are now 3.0 up from just one. Last but not least to mention is the increase performance with the quad core i7 and gtx graphics with the 660m, most games (all of the ones Iplay) can now be played on high or even ultra settings at 1920x1080 while pulling descent frame rates. Anyone expecting performance beyond what this machine can do should not be gaming on any laptop. If you are thinking about getting a laptop and this is in your price range do it, you will not be disappointed, the only other laptop in the same class/price range as this is the MacBook Pro 17 inch and its really no contest if your a true gamer.",

Although my NAS software recognized this hard drive and its 4TB capacity, it would not format and install this drive.  That was, of course, not the fault of this drive.  D-Link's manual clearly states that 2TB is the largest drive supported by either of the two bays, but I still gave it a try.<br /><br />Next, I ordered a Mediasonic ProBox K32-SU3 3.5&#34; SATA Hard Drive Enclosure from Amazon and installed this drive in it.  Using Windows 7.0 Drive Management software, I allocated a single partition for the entire capacity of this drive, did a quick NTFS format and assigned a drive letter.  Once I did that and confirmed that the hard drive was working properly, I used my Acronis backup software to mirror copy the 358GB of data and operating system from my Dell Inspiron notebook computer through a USB 3.0 connection to this drive.<br /><br />When I do a similar backup onto a 1TB 2.5 inch USB 3.0 hard drive from my laptop computer, it usually takes about 3.5 hours.  My backup to this hard drive took only 2.5 hours to complete; the obvious limitation being the speed of my laptop computer's hard drive.  There is enough solid-state memory on this hard drive, so that when the drive motor has powered down, I can still look at what files and folders are on the hard without restarting the drive.  That 8GB of flash memory cache also gives me really fast access to the files.<br /><br />Computer users should be diligent, if not obsessive, about backing up important business and personal files.  Using an external, high-capacity hard drive is one of the fastest and safest ways of doing that.  The 4TB capacity of this drive is big enough for me to do eleven full mirror backups of everything on my laptop computer before I need to begin erasing old files.  This drive is also fast enough to not make the back-up process a chore.  Keeping this drive disconnected from my computer when I'm not backing up files will help prevent it from becoming infected if my computer gets a virus.  Based upon my first-hand experience, I believe that this drive would give very good performance in almost any application.ld files.

I use this with the Smart Cover without any problems.  The screen protector went on tougher than the back, but the small bubbles that were inevitable to show up disappeared after a few days.  The back went on perfectly and gives it a nice glossy look.  Please, watch the video on how to install it and, please, don't get frustrated doing it.  With the installation fluid, it makes it pretty harmless to remove and re-place the film.  So, please, take your time (those of you who watched the video will know what I'm getting at).  Plus, if you just lay the screen protector loosely on top of the screen, you'll see the camera hole doesn't line up quite right.  But, once you actually start putting it on with the squeegee, it stretches a little and it lines up perfectly.  I was also a bit skeptical about the back film covering the rounded corners.  It didn't seem to sit flat right after I put it on, but after it dried over night, it laid down more and I was able to smooth the corners down flat.  I've used it for a couple weeks now and everything is still looking good.  The corners and edges haven't peeled at all.  I also wondered why the hell I'd use a fluid to install this on something electronic, but I was just careful not to get the fluid in any of the holes and had a clothe handy to wipe off excess.  If you're nervous about dropping it, this won't protect against shock.  If you forked out this much money for the iPad mini, you're probably holding it like a newborn baby and won't let anything come near it.  I won't say anything else on that matter so I don't jinx myself.",

Being an ultrabook, it was difficult to disassemble for the upgrades that I made, but it was ultimately worth it. I replaced the 32GB mSata SSD with a 240GB mSata SSD & I made it the boot drive. I replaced the 500GB Sata drive with a 512GB SSD. I replaced the 4 & 6GB RAM sticks with two 8GB sticks. I replaced the CD/DVD burner with a CD/DVD/BR Burner (9.5mm ultra slim series). With all the upgrades, i still spent less than I would have on a Mac Book Pro, and I have all the features I wanted. The touchscreen monitor, Skullcandy speakers, USB 3.0 and SD/Multi card reader are added perks.

From day one I had problems with the hub seemingly going dead - the key board or mouse would just quit in mid-click. We had 6 of these Lenovos at work, and our, since we build USB devices we quickly discovered the Lenovos were slightly off the USB spec in several ways. This made me cut the hub some slack, even though my USB devices did work better when attached directly to the Lenovo.   A few weeks ago the Lenovo died and I replaced it with an Asus. To my annoyance, both my hubs still go dead. I'm off to the store now to try some other brand.  Except for the dying thing these hubs are not bad. The purple light is pretty with the silver finish, and the price was OK. The Power brick is quite weak - trying to charge my phone takes 3x longer on the hub than with the phone's charger. I would not try to run a USB hard drive through this hub.   I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because both hubs are still (almost) working after 2 years.

The padding in this case is not over-the-top, but it seems adequate for an everyday laptop bag. (A little more would've been nice, though.) The front zippered pocket fits the AC charger nicely. There's a phone pocket in there, too, but I'm not sure if my wife will ever use it. Nice to have the option, though. As far as appearance goes, this case is not going to win any fashion awards. But the black nylon material and the overall design falls pretty much in line with other Case Logic products we've purchased over the years.

Main reason I got this over the slim was where the stylus holder is positioned, where the slim version seems obtrusive to me on the bottom of the case.<br /><br />Main issues...<br />The Ipad3 is held in by three clipping points on the top and three on the bottom.  The Ipad can be angled in a horizontal position.  The issue I have is you need to unclip the Ipad on two corner clips closest to the hinge fold of the case.  These edge clips are on way too tight and rub hard when unlatching or latching.  This could mean the clips starting to wear on two corners of the ipad due to clipping unclipping those two corners if you often use the angle option.  The good part to this though is the clips are covered in leather so the Ipad won't be rubbing on plastic or something hard, but still something to be careful with as the when unclipping the case can snap back against the ipad if not being extra careful.<br /><br />The clip that locks the case closed will rub the side as well.<br /><br />Also, the stitching has some points that aren't straight or have some thread coming out.  Very slight, but noticable if you look for that.<br /><br />The clips may wear in better later after being mounted for a while.

A Solid State Hybrid is essentially a hard drive which has a certain amount of NAND Flash memory as the cachet, in this case 8GB of NAND Flash, a SATA 6.0Gb/s interface and the big a capacity of mechanical magnetic disk. It stores the most often used tasks and accessed data in the NAND cache for faster access. (Imagine the NAND Flash cachet as if it were a mini SSD within the SSH).<br /><br />Besides price, the advantage of a SSH over a SSD, is that the SSHD doesn't have a limited lifespan like all SSD drives do. This SSHD might be still running in another decade, even if by then we will be using much bigger files and I would be needing a bigger drive too. But for now, this 1TB is simply perfect for my needs. I used my Toshiba Hybrid to replace the HDD in my laptop and it gave it new stamina. It reminds me of when I installed a SSD in my netbook and it acted as if I had added RAM and a newer CPU. This time, I noticed the expected increase in booting time, and a significant performance in general.<br /><br />One thing worth commenting, it's that this Toshiba Hybrid is a 1TB 5400 RPM drive and I just use it to replace a 500GB 7200 RPM drive, besides the significant performance in booting speed, a 5400 RPM HDD uses less energy and gets less hot, so in an enclose case, like a laptop or All-In-One, the 5400 RPM drive is a better choice. Now, remember, we're talking about a Hybrid which delivers a SSD-like performance. This drive is great, I highly recommended it.",

It's rated as one of the best air coolers. I knew the difference would be noticeable, but I was expecting about 10c difference, not 20c!<br /><br />It also comes with this great program that let's you choose between, silent, balanced, or performance profiles. I love this program, as you can control how loud or quiet your system is. And when it's on quiet, it's VERY quiet, close to silent. And that's where I leave it for normal everyday use. When you get it to high performance, yeah, it's kind of loud, but it's also very cool. And balanced mode, is closer to quiet mode than performance mode. And this is where I put it if I'm doing stress testing.<br /><br />The H100i from Corsair is well worth the 110.00$ they charge for it, because it'll keep you system cooler than any air cooler ever could.

The packaging was more than adequate and the controller arrived without a scratch on it.  I've now had an entire weekend to play with it so these are my thoughts.    I run Windows XP and, like other reviewers, I ignored the CD and downloaded the latest drivers from the Logitech website.  The programming software works ok, but is nothing special.  My previous stick was the Thrustmaster Cougar and the flexibility of the Foxy software is in a different world to the Logitech one.  That being said, however, I didn't personally use the vast majority of those features and instead downloaded other peoples' profiles from the web.  Hopefully, the community will also supply a large number of profiles for the G940.    There is a minor nuisance with the software in that you can't assign stick functions, program a profile or, in fact, start the software at all without the controller plugged in.  This is inconvenient,  but not a showstopper.    The stick itself feels good in the hand and has a slightly rubbery feel to it.  It has a larger footprint on the desk than any other stick I've owned which, presumably, is to accommodate the force feedback motors.  The micro-stick on the joystick that looks like a POV-hat isn't, and the castle switch is instead used as the POV.  Not sure that I particularly like that choice but the micro-stick can be programmed to act as a normal hat if needed.  I've found I need to keep the dead-zone on the microstick axes relatively high to prevent unwanted inputs in flight as the calibration seems to drift slightly.     The throttle unit also feels decent in the hand but isn't exactly going to win any beauty contests.  The twin throttles separate easily and also recombine easily.  The action is smooth and the friction adjustable.  The lit buttons on the throttle base also function nicely as buttons and, I'm told, will function as working LED indicators in the future.  One of my gripes with the throttle is about the R1 and R2 rotaries.  It would have been nice to have had either a detent or at least some physical means of telling when they were centered without having to look at the painted line on them.  But if you're picky about that you can always file a small groove into the center-point yourself.    The pedals are lovely.  Nice and solid, and wide enough for me.  I'm 6\\\\\"3 and find them pretty comfortable.  I've never actually used any other sim-pedals before but I fly little single engine planes in real life so have a pretty good idea how rudder pedals should feel.    I've been playing IL2 and DCS Black Shark and have been loving the force feedback.  At the default settings the feedback is nice and strong, and the force can be ramped up or down in the Logitech software to suit your tastes.  Using the trim function in Black Shark and having the stick actually stay in the trim position is fantastic and actually 'feeling' your warbird about to enter a stall in IL2 really helps with both my flying and my sense of immersion in the sim.    The 3-axis trims on the stick are great in IL2 and incredibly useful.  Once again, no 'feelable' center position but you can't have everything.    One thing I did after a few minutes of using the stick was to put a little piece of tape over the \\\\\"dead man's switch\\\\\".  This is a little sensor that detects whether the user's hands are on the stick or not and turns down the force feedback if necessary.  It's a nice feature in theory but, especially in black shark with the stick in a trimmed position, I find the stick will jump around if I loosen my grip on the stick and no longer cover the sensor, so I took the decision to cover it up permanently.  I just make sure to unplug the DC power to the stick if I leave it unattended.    Overall, very happy with the product with just a small wish-list for extra software functionality.",

My kiddo doesn't have an email address--I didn't want to even mess with having to monitor that--so the FreeTime app let me register the Kindle in my name and add content she could utilize from my Kindle. That way my adult books and magazines weren't clogging up her kindle storage.    The Meyday feature was interesting. On Christmas Day I was surprised it was up and running. However, the customer service rep was new--she offered this up front--and obviously has never used a Kindle before. She helped me but had to put me on hold for minutes at a time while she learned herself. It still wasn't the outcome I was hoping for but it works for now.

Also, the Anroid Market is not available on the Fire, but thankfully you can side1oad standard adroid apps.  The battery life is a little less than an iPad.  But Kindles have always been known for their long lasting battery. Even though this is a tablet, but I feel Amazon should have focused on battery life a little bit more.  The response can be sluggish at times, which I presume is because it only has 512MB RAM. This is a media device. At no time should it have any trouble playing a video. I would have paid more to get at least the 1GB RAM.  Overall:  I have an original iPad, and so far I prefer the Kindle Fire. Sure, the iPad is shinier and snappier, but it was always too large and heavy. The Kindle Fire fits easily in my pocket and fits my needs.

Like I said, it was already snug so it isn't moving anywhere.<br /><br />The cut outs for all the buttons, cameras and speakers are precise and have ample room for their functions. The back piece that holds the tablet upright and at angle is large and firm, however - the little flap that holds the stand open, seems a tad bit small, perhaps even flimsy, but so far, has been able to do its job just fine.<br /><br />The keyboard is much thinner that what the photos show. The buttons felt good to type with and the magnets that hold the keyboard in place on the cover, is strong enough that moderate shaking holds it in place.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the locking flap that holds the case shuts, is left rather awkwardly in the way when you have the case open like a laptop. One other thing, though not certain if it's the case or the kindle itself or the application - but I have found that in certain situations, when closing the case, the kindle will go into sleep mode, other times it does not and the screen stays on until you remember to push the on/off button to turn it off (or it times out).",

It's a budget PC that has a lot to offer to a busy household looking for a computer that will allow users to surf the internet, email, complete homework, pay bills, listen to streaming music and watch Amazon Prime programming if desired.<br /><br />If you're feeling adventurous, this PC could even be connected to a HDTV and used as a Home Theater PC to show Netflix content or similar if desired. (I like to get a [[ASIN:B005DKZTMG Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad, Black]] and hook up PCs via a HDMI cable to my HDTV to enjoy PC on TV!) I would suggest upgrading the memory to at least 8GB before doing this however.<br /><br />With a Windows 7 Home Premium operating system this Dell is compatible with most all software available for PCs, although it doesn't come loaded with a lot of it which allows you to fill up the huge 1TB (1000 GB) hard drive yourself!<br /><br />The installed hard drive is a speedy 7200 RPM drive which can be upgraded to an even speedier SSD drive should you desire. (I did it with my Dell XPS running the same operating system and it made an incredible difference in speed and performance when using multiple applications.)<br /><br />While no speed demon this PC is no slouch either. It's hampered a bit by only 4GB of installed memory (using 1 of 2 memory slots).  The good news is that can be upgraded too! You can have up to 16GB of memory installed and that makes a profound difference in the performance of virtually any PC. The motherboard has 3MB of cache which is good - not great, and the processor is good.<br /><br />Overall, this PC has a lot that someone looking to replace an older desktop would like, at a fair price.  It wouldn't satisfy those who need enhanced graphics and sound, but for the price, it's a good deal.<br /><br />NOTE: I do not own this desktop, but took the opportunity to review it after checking it out at a friend's house, thus there is no 'verified' purchase notation on this review.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+ Inexpensive with solid specs<br />+ HDMI port<br />+ VGA (monitor) port<br />+ Bluetooth connectivity<br />+ Both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0<br />+ HUGE 1TB 7200 RPM hard drive.<br />+ Memory expandable to 16GB with (2) memory slots<br />+ Windows 7 - still my favorite!<br />+ 8 in 1 Media Card Reader<br />+ USB Mouse & Keyboard included.<br />+ Build quality is good, even at low price point.<br />+ 1 Year Warranty through Dell<br />+ Gigabit Ethernet card<br />+ Not tons of bloatware (unnecessary software) added to this one.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Integrated 5.1 supported sound; no separate sound card.<br />- Integrated video graphics; no separate video card.<br />- Only 4GB of memory installed, which is minimal and should be upgraded to at least 8GB for good performance.<br /><br />SUGGESTED ADD ONS:<br /><br />No monitor comes with this desktop, but I've had great luck with Dell branded monitors, Planar (3 year warranties on their stuff...) and most recently ViewSonic.<br /><br />Some you may want to consider include [[ASIN:B00EZSUVHK ViewSonic VX2452MH 24-Inch LED-Lit LCD Monitor, Full HD 1080p, 2ms, 50M:1 DCR, Game Mode, HDMI/DVI/VGA, VESA]], [[ASIN:B009O847CQ Planar PLL2210W 22\\\\\" Widescreen LED Monitor]], and the [[ASIN:B009H0XQRI Dell S2440L 24-Inch Screen LED-lit Monitor]].<br /><br />Alternatively you can also add this PC to your HDTV via HDMI.  Big or small, HDTVs with HDMI ports can work as monitors too!<br /><br />If you want some speakers to add to your PC, I can recommend this Bluetooth one: [[ASIN:B00MQDBRMO Polaris V8 Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker with FM-Radio, NFC, AUX Jack, TF Card Slot, Voice Prompts, LED Display, Build-in HQ MIC for Hands Free Calls, Up to 10 Hours Play Time, 2000mAh Removable Rechargeable 18650 Li-ion Battery.

After several months of use with occasional crashing the ram issues got worse till eventually the PC would crash several times a day. At this point I decided to call customer support. After being told to replace EVERYTHING, from the ram, the hard drive, the power supply, and even the processor, tech support finally decided to replace the motherboard. Apparently ASUS has an absurdly long RMA process that takes several days to ship out, despite my urgent request that I needed a functioning PC for work.<br /><br />I have been brand loyal to ASUS for over a decade, telling all of my family and friends to purchase their products when upgrading a PC or buying a tablet. But their unusually difficult technical support is really making me reconsider my opinions of this company. I have wasted dozens of hours with them, as well as money not getting work done because of their strangely rigid and inflexible RMA process.<br /><br />I will update this post when I get a clear answer on my RMA status and can verify that the new board is working correctly, but right now I'm not holding my breath.

This case not only feels great but functions as well as a case can be designed. Together, this makes for just a wonderful case.  But beware, I did some some reviews that stated that this case was not for the iPad Mini with Retina Display.  I tested it with my original iPad Mini and it worked great.<br /><br />PROS<br />*Synthetic leather is buttery soft to the touch, water resistant and presents a tremendous value.  This case feels like a $50 - $75 dollar case but costs only a fraction of that.<br />*Rubberized plastic iPad holder clip does a great job of holding the iPad in place and also makes it easy to pop the iPad in and out.  All ports on the iPad are easily accessed and the holder doesn't wrap around the screen, it takes advantage of the rim on the iPad to snap in and out<br />*Microfiber inside has a really cool looking deign- protects screen and is soft to the touch<br />*Magnets in the cover protect the screen and also work nicely with sleeping and waking the iPad  Cover holds nicely in place when turned upside down.<br />*Variable pitch allows you to get just the right viewing angle.  If you pull the iPad all the way out it makes for a nice angle for typing.  Once positioned properly, screen doesn't slip and you can easily tap on the iPad and the case won't tip over.<br />*Super slim, adds a minimal amount to the iPad's size.<br /><br />CONS<br />*None - I can't think of one thing Anker could do to improve this case, everything works perfectly and for this price this case is a steal!<br /><br />I have seen and come across a lot of cases in my day and this is one of the best I have ever seen.  The synthetic leather feels incredibly soft and will fool most people, it is that good.  The case functions beautifully in holding the iPad, sleeping/waking the iPad, positioning the iPad and protecting the iPad.  I really look hard for things I like and don't link and ways to improve the product and am just stumped.  Hands down one of the best cases out there!<br /><br />I was provided a sample by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review.for things I like and don't link and ways to improve the product and am just stumped.

The Razor utility that comes along with it that allows you to program the different keys.  It worked great for a couple weeks for me, then I started having problems.  Seems like something is always pushing the right direction arrow key.  Or pushing left then right over and over again.  It isn't right away, I can get about 4-5 minutes of good use out of it before this happens.  If the utility loads you can not stop this problem, even if you terminate the process.  If you pull the USB and re attach, sometimes you can get another good 5 mins out of it.  I had to uninstall the Razor software to correct the problem.  Rendering the extra keys useless.      Still, I'd rather lose those keys than the functionality of the entire keyboard.  I'm sure they will release a revision at some point to correct it.  Its still only v 1.0",

Upload speed is the same ~730Kbs.  Also, some folks are tempted to verify Gbs speed with casual file copying from one PC to another. Not so easy: with modern hard drive you can only scratch Gbs bandwidth (~25% utilization max) simply because HD could only deliver about 30-35 MB/s  sustained read/write rate (~300Mbs). Gbs LAN could push 125MB/s on both send and receive channels (full duplex). In order to saturate the link you will need to spend a big chunk of green for raid 0, or 10 array with 4+ disks on both PCs. Took some time to set time restriction policy for kids PCs. As usual, it takes two blocking policies: one for early morning and one for late evening hours.

I then bought this same memory card for my daughter's Garmin Nuvi 650, which was a different story. Not the fault of the memory card, but Garmin makes you go through some extra steps on some of their older models, including the 650, because they do not automatically save excess storage to the new inserted memory card. It is all explained on the Garmin site, but I ended up calling the Garmin help desk to make sure I had it right. They were very cooperative & helpful, but that's another story. Either way, this SanDisk memory card performed as well as can be expected, and I have nothing negative to say about it. Several months have gone by and both GPSs are working fine, even after a new map update. I would recommend this card for Garmin Nuvi GPSs.",

I am reading a lot of comments for the low ratings on here and have a couple of things to add:<br /><br />1) This is not a &#34;powered&#34; hub beyond the little bit of power provided by the &#34;bus power&#34;, so if your device relies on the USB 3.0 slot for power you can't use this for more than one device.  For example, small 2.5&#34; external hard drives with no other power source.  You may be able to use two, but it's a gamble.  If you want to connect such devices, buy a USB 3.0 hub with an external power cable to provide the additional power needed.  If your external USB 3.0 device (hard drive, DVD, etc.) has its own power supply, this will work brilliantly!<br /><br />2) Your motherboard must have driver support to additional USB 3.0 ports.  Most newer ones do, but if you have an early 3.0 board you will have some trouble if you try to connect too many devices.  This is a factor of the chipset used by the motherboard, not the manufacturer of this hub.  If you have a 4th or 5th generation Intel i3, i5 or i7 processor, you will be fine.  Some motherboards which support 3rd generation i processors will also be OK, depending on the chipset.",

I bought this one because it indicated that it was USB. I found out after receiving it, that it is the same keyboard I had with a PS2 to USB converter. This PS2 to USB converter does not work well at all with KVM switches. A well documented problem on the web forums. I tried it and confirmed it has problems using it with the converter. I gave it away and bought the Microsoft 4000 wire keyboard. It is \\\\\"real\\\\\" USB and works fantastic with the USB KVM switch. So I would recommend spending the extra few bucks and getting the MS 4000 Ergo Keyboard. Plus it has lots of new features the old one lacks.",

No manuals, and does not bode well for any hope of support.    After 5 minutes of Google searches I hit on Mediagate, with a variation of the model number, and got a hit (one of only 3) to a what seems to be the same product at a company called \\\\\"MediaGateUSA\\\\\".  The model number is slightly different but the product looks the same. A link is below if Amazon allows it:    [...]    This site promises planned support downloads for the product category, but the last release on their PR page was 2009.  Again, not much hope for real support.    I will likely buy this from Amazon, since the price is reasonable enough to write it off to experience if it fails in a year or so.  In addition, there seems to be very little else available.    Might lead one to think that Microsoft have pretty much written off MediaCenter. Pity - I was just getting to like it in Win7.

It fits my hand quite nicely with a palm grip, and has a nice &#34;sand paper&#34;-esque finish where you thumb rests and also where your pinky and ring finger lay. However it also feels like there is a nice &#34;clear coat&#34; type of material to smooth out the finish. I quite like this texture as it provides some grip to your hand without being too rough that it hurts after a long period of usage. This mouse holds AMAZINGLY in the hand, for a guy like me with larger than average hands, finding a mice that fits my hands is a rather difficult task, but with the G 602, Logitech has found the perfect grip on a mouse, at least for me.<br /><br />---------------------<br />Buttons<br />---------------------<br />All of the buttons on this mouse are customizable and can even change the DPI of the mouse if selected. The left and right main buttons have a nice click, and if you notice, the middle finger right button goes out a little bit farther than the left and adds to the futuristic aesthetic. The two buttons on the left side of the left mouse click are set to be DPI change by default, but I changed them to my liking (specifically being Middle Click / and Enter) The rest of the buttons on the side of the mouse are also very nice, and easy to distinguish between each one after using the mouse for a couple of days. Finally there is a power switch on the bottom which is pretty standard and does what it needs to, and a switch at the top to switch between Endurance Mode and Performance Mode. This mouse was clocked in at 250 hrs in Performance mode, which increases the polling rate of the mouse, up to 500. Endurance mode keeps the mouse locked at 125, which is perfectly fine for me, but Your Millage May Vary. I have personally kept it in Endurance mode the entire time as I don't find the faster polling rate to be that noticeable in games and other desktop activities. But it isn't re-programmable.<br /><br />---------------------<br />Misc.<br />---------------------<br />The scroll wheel on this mouse is nice and has small intervals on advancing to the next few lines on the screen. I wish it did have the free scrolling wheel like on the Performance MX which I had before this bad boy.<br /><br />It does however have a nice little slot to store the receiver, but the receiver is unfortunately not one of their Unifying Receiver, which I have quite a few of around my house.<br /><br />It can run on just one battery, if the mouse feels too heavy for you.<br /><br />The software is extremely easy to use and has some nice features, such as being able to set different profiles for specific applications and games.<br />---------------------<br />Conclusion<br />---------------------<br />This mouse is a game changer for me. Never again will I use another mouse without plenty of buttons on it, coming from a Performance MX this mouse has completely blown me away. This is the best wireless mouse for the money almost hands down, and I would recommend it to anyone. Even more, with it on sale ( I got mine for $40)",

I still use the thunderbolt drive regularly. The case is scratched because I leave it in my daily carry bag to the office and back. I'm pretty sure the case is plastic because of how it's worn through. Aside from vanity- cable and drive still works flawlessly!   Recently I've recently upgraded the 5400rpm drive in my 2011 Macbook Pro to a 500gb SSD. And my work 2013 macbook has a stock 500gb SSD. I simply don't have room for my Lightroom photo library so I keep it all on this TB G-Drive (backed up regularly of course). When working through 12-20mp files in lightroom I experience no delays. If I import a very large batch of files from SD card --&#62; Lightroom --&#62; this drive it takes longer to write than it does to the internal SSD but that's expected.  ---------  Pros: + Thunderbolt! + 7200rpm HD + Comes with thunderbolt and usb 3.0 cable + Doesn't run hot + No bulky annoying power supply (hey it's been a really long time since I bought an external HD)  Cons: - Cost - Would be more cost effective to go with a USB 3.0 drive  The long version:  Out of the box I was impressed with the look and feel. Amazon is stating that the enclosure is stainless steel but I could've sworn it was just a really nice plastic, especially in comparison to my Macbook. It's still nice and looks a million times better than that orange lacie bumper drive thing. It mimics the older non retina MacBook pros in thickness and the LED light takes cues from the macbook as well. It comes with the thunderbolt cable which I learned afterwards is really expensive when bought alone.  The first thing I did was format the drive and moved a 114 GB folder over to free up some space. OSX doesn't tell you the exact rate of transfer in mb/s and I was surprised to see that this folder was going to take more than an hour to copy over. Thunderbolt is advertised at 10gb/s transfer rate! Well I completely oversaw the fact that with a spinning hard drive you are limited to the disk read/write speed. In the real world thunderbolt has an advantage over USB 3.0 when it comes to Raid or SSD setups. With 5400/7200 rpm drives you are much better off saving some money and going with a USB 3.0 drive- granted you have USB 3.0 on your computer. I have the earliest Macbook pro with thunderbolt and only USB 2.0 so this drive is a good choice for me.  For the money this is currently the best 1 TB thunderbolt/USB 3.0 drive for the money because of the 7200 rpm drive. Right now all of the competition is using a much slower 5400 rpm drive at this price point. While transferring a lot of files back and forth and testing it, it did get warm to the touch but nothing out of the ordinary and certainly not burning hot like some are reporting for other thunderbolt external drives.  So how fast is it? It took a little more than an hour to transfer that 114 GB folder. It's late, I don't feel like crunching numbers so I did a quick test to get a better grasp on how fast that is. I put about a bunch of large photoshop, illustrator and jpegs into a folder (totaling 3.5 GB) and transferring that from one partition to another on the stock 5400 rpm drive in my macbook took about 3 min 49 seconds. Transferring that same folder to the G-Drive took 1 min 27 seconds! Definitely breathes some life into my machine and I can't wait to move all of my adobe files and pictures over and work directly off of the G-Drive.  This is still an initial review and I'll update as I work more with it.  EDIT: Ok to quickly clarify and add some things I missed last night. It's a pretty quiet drive, there is no fan but you can still here the disk spinning like any other platter drive. Also, I picked up the box and noticed that G Technology clearly states on the box, in orange, &#34;transfer speeds up to 136mb/s&#34; which is about as fast as a 7200 rpm drive will go. Quickand rough calculation in my head and I seem to get just below that. Compared to other 5400 based thunderbolt drives that have transfer speeds of around ~70-80 mb/s. Kudos to G for not trying to milk the regular &#34;10gb/s transfer rate!&#34; thunderbolt marketing claims that some other manufacturers are abusing.",

The box it came in is the same as the product I got last time, but the tablet inside was 7\\\\\" diagonal, and had a 5\\\\\" screen and one home button. The back was silver, instead of white, and the inside of the box was dirty and oily. How that happens I'm not sure. Also the tablet looked like it was flipped face down and dragged across concrete or sanded or something. The entire face was scratched and scuffed.The back had huge cracks and chunks taken out of it. This does not seem shipping related. It seems they shipped me used garbage. TO TOP IT OFF! There is a quality control sticker on the side, it says QC17. Did the quality control check to see the item had mass or something? AND ON TOP OF THAT! It didn't charge, and it didn't even turn on. I can't say anything else about it other than what I got TWICE was garbage. Thanks for Amazon return policy.<br /><br />JUlY 10,2012<br />Opened the box:<br />  The back of the tablet was opened, like it wasn't closed all the way during assembly. I pushed it back together and went on to enjoy my new tablet. It booted up, had 4.0 installed and a koi fish background. It was very impressive and responsive off the bat. I installed a lot of apps that I have on my phone, and played some games. After a while I tried to watch a movie and the sound stopped working. The volume was all the way up, but nothing came out through headphones or the speaker. I decided I'd play with it later in frustration and hoped I had just messed with a setting to do that or something. I plug it into the wall, and then it shuts off. Not the normal way, but just goes black. Now it won't turn on at all, and to top it off the back popped off again like it's the wrong size or something. It just won't close in one spot. This one is obviously defective and I contacted the shipper for a new one as a replacement. Now I see that the tablet is being sold by someone else so we'll see how this works out...",

It's a replacement for my MacBook Pro's dead Superdrive.<br /><br />First of all, I read in these reviews that a lot of people's Superdrives have died. Minus 10 points to Apple.<br /><br />Secondly, I read a lot of things in these reviews that made me worry, so here's my experience:<br /><br />I paid $35 which was awesome. I loved the high star rating of this device on Amazon, but I was wary that some or a lot of the reviews might be fake. The negative reviews were VERY negative (one star). I took a chance and so far it looks great.<br /><br />I am running Mac OS 10.6.8. I plugged the drive in and my computer instantly recognized it and loaded a DVD I put in it, then when I asked it to burn a DVD from the Disk Utility, I thought I would have a problem, but no. It instantly ejected the drive door and asked me if I wanted to burn in that drive, without me even telling it anything.<br /><br />I had heard a lot about the Nero software and how it was only a short free trial, but I didn't open the Nero software. I didn't need to. So all of that has me very happy.<br /><br />Also, it does not have a power cable, which I like.<br /><br />It DOES take up 2 USB ports, which is a little annoying, but I don't really care. I have hard drives that do the same thing, so I'm used to it.<br /><br />Someone on here complained that it's light and it moves around the desktop but so far its weight does not surprise me. It's no lighter than I would have expected.<br /><br />I can't speak to its reliability yet because I've only had it for about 20 minutes.

This is a known problem with USB 3.0 and wifi and bluetooth.

Do not place hard drives or other USB devices behind the rear of your Mac near at the hinge of your screen.

Look at product description carefully and never buy from a re seller.

Had to reset to factory default each time and re-configure.  It takes several re configuring attempts before it will receive internet. Workes great when working.  Quit again this week.  Tired of messing with this thing, did not want to contact Hawking's useless support and tried to return it.  Found out that I had inadvertently purchased it from an Amazon reseller - antoline.  I had clicked the product description on my \\\\\"Your Order\\\\\" page from the previous two repeater purchase/returns and was directed to a page from where I ordered this third Hawking repeater.  It was not from Amazon and antoline would not take it back, responding that I had exceeded the 30 day return window.  Contacted Amazon and they are trying to remedy with their A to Z guarantee.  I'm pretty confident that Amazon will take care of this.  Stay tuned.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:  Before returning to Amazon, I rebooted repeater went through setup and it worked!  Worked for about 3 weeks then lost internet again.  Rebooted/setup several times without success.  Waited 5 days and rebooted/setup - it received internet!  I'm thinking that something changes in the repeater or WiFi hot spot after several weeks and the repeater needs a reboot and setup.  Still a hassle.  The Hawking USB HAWNU1 adapter never needs this kind of attention.  But I need this repeater in order to receive wifi on several computers.  No other manufacturer offers a similar device (that accepts an external receiving antenna) so I am stuck with rebooting/setup every couple weeks.  If someone knows of a similar product, I sure would like to hear about it<br /><br />UPDATE:  The adapter I had working quit after about 3 weeks.  Powers on, but no internet. Rebooted several times no success.  Sent that back and ordered another one which worked great after setup.  Worked great for about three weeks and it quit receiving internet too.  Reset/rebooted it a couple times but would not receive internet.  I foolishly called Hawking tech support and they had me go through the reboot without success.  I will not order another one.  I'll stick to the Hawking USB adapter, which has been working well.<br /><br />AMAZON HAS BEEN GREAT with my return & refund of theses devices.  They probably should stop selling these repeaters - it's got to be costing them money on the shipping back and forth.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Repeater would not connect after setup.  Spent over two hours on two separate calls with Hawking Tech Support.  Both support people kept having me repeat the reboot process without success.  Probably rebooted over 20 times!  Tech people only knew how to reboot - no other solution.  The first one hung up on me and the second one told me to return it and order another one.  Amazon sent me another one and the second one was DOA.  Would not even turn on.  While looking at reviews about this repeater, came across one from Dragos Toader who had a fix for the connection problem.  I followed his advice and the repeater now works great.  Good repeater but poor Hawking Tech Support and documentation was the reason for the low rating. I own several other Hawking Wireless products which works great and have not had any issues with their products until this repeater.<br /><br />I recommend reading Dragos Toader's review/comments before attempting to make this unit operate properly.

So the smaller issue I've found is that you can't read on a metal surface. Rather, you can, but folding the cover across the back and setting it down causes the Kindle to go back into the sleep screen and you have to manually wake it. Not a big deal, but a little annoying if you pick it up and put it down a lot.<br /><br />The bigger problem I found was that this protective case actually damages my kindle!! The little silver magnetic clasp clamps onto the leather front, but they never bothered filing the edges of the closure. This has begun creating little scratches on the right side of my kindle. It is only on the black frame surrounding the screen, but it really bothers me that the device meant to protect my Kindle is slowly damaging it! For now I've gone ahead and covered my Kindle with a piece of tape so that takes the scratches instead, but I'm going to take a metal file to it and hope that does the trick.<br /><br />With all of that said, I love the rest of it! It's a sturdy case and the texture provides a great grip for holding it. Overall, a great design minus the scuffing :)",

I also wanted 1066MHz for better performance, which was a bit difficult to find, but having purchased memory on Amazon.com in the past (mostly Crucial or Kensington), I searched and found this kit by Komputerbay.  I had never heard of the company, but the price was great, and this kit was exactly what I was looking for.  The Heatspreaders are another excellent feature that give me peace of mind as well because they help increase the longevity of the memory by more efficiently dissipating the heat.  I work in IT so I have installed a lot of RAM in my day, and I put a lot of demands on my computer.  I also work on our website constantly which requires graphic design and web design software (mostly Adobe CS4).  I installed the new memory as soon as it arrived (shipping was very fast too), and my computer performance has been excellent ever since!  :-)  I will definitely purchase more memory from Komputerbay in the future, and I would highly recommend Komputerbay to anyone looking for an affordable way to upgrade their RAM.

Since it wouldn't have served my purpose to leave the cabinet door open, I resorted to modifying it to provide adequate ventilation so as to avoid overheating of my sensitive electronic equipment, which throws off a good deal of heat.  The cabinet has an elevated \\\\\"floor\\\\\" about 4 inches off the carpet, so I cut oval holes large enough to accommodate grommets that I also purchased from Amazon, through which I ran the cabling from behind the cabinet and into the interior from below.  That solved two issues; how to get the cabling inside and, importantly, how to provide a source of cool air as the cabinet was exhausted.  The cabinet top has both a finished \\\\\"ceiling,\\\\\" with a small \\\\\"attic\\\\\" or air space above, and then is covered with a \\\\\"roof\\\\\" - that's 2 separate layers.  I took the roof off and cut two rectangular holes in the ceiling to accommodate 2 oak louvers that I stained to match the finish of the cabinet interior, so the interior looks very professional.  Some people have remarked that it looks like it was factory made that way.  Now to the installation of the case fans; I fabricated a new roof out of 3/16-inch mahogany veneer in which I cut two (2) holes to accommodate the 2 Antec Big Boy case fans, positioning them so they exhaust upward into the room, running the wiring up to the top side.  I sealed the edges of the case fans to the roof and the roof to the top of the cabinet by applying some caulking to ensure that air would be pulled from below, rather than leaking into the attic and then immediately exhausted.  I had a variable voltage transformer with a in-line controller that I Used as a power supply, directly wiring in the fans on the 12v side and added a 120v AC cord to the other.  That completed the installation.  I can vary the speed of the fans and, unless I turn them up to maximum rpms, it's very difficult to hear them running.  They do a great job of creating a negative pressure inside the cabinet that effectively draws cool air from below to keep my electronic equipment cool.  I'm very pleased with how well the project worked out and extremely happy with the amount of cooling it provides.  I'd recommend this fan to anyone who wants a high flow at minimal noise levels.ult to hear them running.

I carry it on my key chain so the only annoying thing is when I need my keys but also need the Cruzer in the computer.  Thus you have to remover the Cruzer via Windows which takes about 5-10 seconds after a few clicks of the mouse--very simple but slightly bothersome because of my needs.

This review is based on that time frame.  It seems promising anyhow.  Over all, I used to use a Wacom (no screen) tablet, and it was a great product.  The problem was that I never got over the awkwardness of not actually drawing directly on the surface.  As you can see, the market price of screened tablet is quite expensive so to begin with, so I was about to give up on screened tablet till I came across this product.  After using this for hours I only found some minor flaws, but over all it is an excellent pentablet!  Let me get across the flaws first.    First of all, there are no grips on the pen.  This could noticeably hurt your fingers within few hours. Not a tough problem to solve however.  Secondly, there seems to be a slight lag between the movement of the pen and the response of the screen.  When you're rapidly moving your pen to cover a broad area with a paint tool, you might notice how the lag causes less surface area to be covered.  Third and finally, for lefties, you may accidentally press the button when you're drawing causing the screen to zoom in or out, due to its layout.  I tried vertically inverting the image through settings, but due to the lighting placement of the tablet, it completely whites out the screen.  Not a big problem though, just need to learn to not rest your hand on the buttons.  Now the good stuff.  The pressure sensitivity might take time to get used to, but once you do so, it responds with quality.  Also, the fact that it functions as an extended desktop works well when you're dealing with a long-term drawing.  You get to play some distraction in the main monitor...  The color is quite true to what shows up on the computer's main monitor.  May be a little darker? Not to a level that shows issue to me.  The complete portability of this product helps too.  It's very light, compact enough, and does not require an AC adaptor... BIG plus to the last part.    And of course, the obvious.  THE PRICE.  The price is amazing for what you get.  I don't think I would be overstating if I said this product offers you high quality digitizer tablet while maintaining 1/3 (or less) of the price to its competitor.  Now this, should be the new standard for this market.  Honestly.  Finally, just for those who have been using other tablets before hand and is thinking about purchasing this.    The installation might get slightly confusing.  It took me awhile to realize how my pre-existing tablet driver was prohibiting the installation of this new tablet driver...I couldn't set up many minor details of this hardware till I noticed that.  Over all, the value beats its flaws by miles.  Five stars.    Just for your information, I used this tablet on a 2011 MBP 13\\\\\", boot camp.

I used the supplied micro USB to my Laptop, which was plugged in and charging. There is no wall charger - just USB.<br /><br />Cover:<br />I wish it had a little more tactile grip feel, or slightly more texture to it. The cover fit perfect on my iPad 3. All ports and areas accessible, and iPad Apple logo was visible when removed from stand. The iPad 3 charged with no blocking or issues. Removing it from the iPad was easy and the directions were very clear. Press and hold two spots, and it snaps back off.<br /><br />Sliding Bracket:<br />The cover attachment took some practice to attach, but it was secure and had 360 degrees of motion. The slide of the bracket allowed for many adjustable potions both vertical and horizontal. You need to note that the iPad needs to rest on the keyboard at different angles. It just can't tilt and hold its position off the keyboard, as it will not balance correctly. If you do open all the way - it needs to be supported which I was able to do when commuting across my lap. Not perfect, but other cases I have tried can't do this. The release switch slides the bracket out, and it can simply be pushed back in without using the release switch. This is both good and bad depending on how you use the case. For some, they might not want the slide to push back in if holding in a lap.<br /><br />Keyboard:<br />The Bluetooth key board connected as my other devices with no issues. Battery life presented no concerns as compare with my other devices. The hot keys at top, responded with iPad 3 settings. Typing was as expected on a smaller key board, and one would expect to not type full time on this. It will never replace the comfort a full size key board. The spacebar cut-out opening for the thumb could be a little larger for me. 8 rubber bumpers around the outside of the keyboard protect the iPad when closed. It does need some forceto open, as it tends to feel very stiff. I like the fact that I know it will stay closed and protected in my bag. 4 rubber feet prevent from sliding on smooth surfaces. They worked well on my desk. There are bright colored LED's display Charge, Cap, and Bluetooth Status in the center front of the keyboard. I found them very easy to see and monitor. The charging micro USB port is located on the right side, near the center -so it felt like it did not interfere even when charging while typing.<br /><br />Summary: No small compact keyboard case is perfect. For me, this had some product options and operation that out weighed the ones it did not have.<br /><br />Pro's - Very flexible positioning - 360 degrees (horizontal and vertical)<br /> Light weight and very small<br /> Clam detaches for iPad free use - along with still being very slim when detached.<br /> Compatible with multiple iPad generations<br /><br />Con's - Slippery plastic inexpensive feel/touch - (this was the biggest for me........)<br /> Key board spacebar needs more thumb area cut-out in channel.<br /> Lock key directly over delete key",

The unit was not exactly as pictured above. It is actually a TEAC, or at least the one I received was. The mini runs XP, and the unit was recognized and installed immediately. I needed to install printer software, and the unit worked perfectly well for this. Just for grins I tried to burn a music CD, and that worked fine too, though it was slow, about 15 minutes for an Ipod playlist burn. Burning doc files was reasonably fast.    If you are looking for an external drive/burner to use as a primary piece of equipment, or to replace a broken one in a current machine that you intend to keep a while, you might want to spend a bit more money and get some more bells and whistles. I doubt this unit is going to take a lot of heavy use for a long time. But if your need is simply to have a little back up, or as was the case with me, something to use to just load some data into a machine with no drive, this should be just the ticket.

I then moved them to my emachines PC and they froze my computer up and the drives became corrupted.  I could reformat (yay, hours of work gone), and get it to work again with my Sony laptop.  I tried it on a Toshiba laptop...same problem with the emachines PC....froze up, drive became corrupted, had to be reformatted.  This all take place with repeated returns to Seagate and hours on the phone with their tech support as well before i finally realized it was a compatability issue with 2 of my 4 computers.  I am now using these as backup storage/archiving only with my Dell PC, on which I have had no problems like with the Sony Vaio.  So it appears to be a 50% success/failure rate for me.  The Dell has Vista and the other three had Windows XP, so the OS doesn't seem to be the culprit.  Have had other seagates up to 500 Gb capacity previously purchased that are working to this day, but I have switched over to Western Digital after this mess.  Seagate techs were very helpful, but ultimately a LOT of my time was wasted on the phone, and sending HDs back and forth to Seagate for repairs that apparently didn't work.  The one fix I haven't tried yet is to disable the orange pulsing access light--supposedly this fixes the problem in some cases, but I have given up at this point and will just use it with the Dell...it may be that the size of the drive is too much for the two computers to handle...and I also did try partitioning them to see if that would help, but it did not.  Talking with people at an electronics store, I was told that they got a lot of complaints about the Seagates...as others have said, when they work, the work great.  And I must say I am impressed with the 5-year warranty these things have, but I am thinking that may put Seagate out of business!",

I watched the video put up by the distributor and it made it simple. I now use the Kindle to not only read email, but to answer it, which I didn't do before very much. This keyboard is not a full sized keyboard, but is more than adequate for typing emails and documents. I love using it for URLs, searches and filling out web forms. It is just so much quicker than the touch screen.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with the quality of workmanship. The product does not feel light and cheap and it looks good.

These head phones are perfect for anyone whether you are just looking for great sound quality or you are a passionate gamer.<br /><br />What makes these headphones so great for gaming is the way the mic is positioned.  With its rotating attachment and flexible neck it is easy to maneuver into whatever position is best for you and it is stiff enough that it will stay where you have adjusted it to as well.  The mic quality is also crystal clear and my friends even commented on how much clearer I sounded than with my previous set.  Also most important for any gaming is sound quality.  These headphones clearly pick up even the smallest of sounds and you can clearly hear the direction and intensity of an approaching player in a game such as a First Person Shooter.<br /><br />If I did have one negative thing to say about them it is that, although they are a comfortable soft design, they are moderately heavy and might take a bit of time to get used to for extended gaming or listening.<br /><br />I think one of the best attributes of these headphones is the convenient sound control capabilities on the cord that makes life much easier and no longer do I have to reach up to adjust my speakers or exit out of the game.  The added bonus of the mute switch for the mic is nice as well and I like that I can clip this to my shirt or belt for easy access.<br /><br />Honestly I would compare these favorably to my Bose speakers in terms of sound quality.

This might be more nuts-and-bolts than many users would be comfortable with.<br /><br />The resulting drive does not appear however to be a true clone.

There have been other small indications--when I opened the Amazon web page, it no longer recognized and logged me in.  I immediately checked Lightroom, as the loss of the catalog file would be a real problem, but that was fine.  I assume that the software makes some selections of what it moves to speed up the process, or the problem may lie elsewhere, but be aware that cloning in my case did not result in a completely continuous experience.

It's very light. For you travelers thats great, but if you are leaving it on your desk it could stand to be a little more hefty.

My only gripe is that it's sooooo slow, my old laptop is easily 3 times as fast at pulling up web pages or opening files. I have nothing on the hard drive, the only program installed is itunes and i have a good 20Mbps internet connection. Download speed is not a problem as such; it's the long pause before it tries to open a webpage or the 10-15 seconds of egg timer while waiting for relativley small files to open. I'm not sure if it's because it only has 1GB ram or Windows 7 is such a resource hog (even the starter version). I'm going to try 2GB of ram to see if cures the problem because its extremely frustrating. I suspect that all netbooks might have the same problem and maybe my expectations were too high but I would suggest you try one first; just open some web pages or browse some files and see if you can live with it before you buy.<br />Also the scroll bar is extremely annoying but most of them are. There are some other good features though, the battery life is awesome and it doesn't get too hot unlike my old laptop.",

When I was done, I thought my applying job was okay, but I was disappointed in myself as there were a couple of bubbles here and there. But lo and behold, they started to fade as time passed!

In my haste, I purchased this not realizing it is essentially a cheap knock-off of the one I own.  Beware.    I have had no problems transferring data using this enclosure with an SATA hard disk.  However, I will refrain from buying another one of these enclosures due to the poor construction of the case and poor design of the power cable.  The enclosure is equipped to connect to both IDE and SATA disks, but there is barely enough room inside the enclosure for the SATA power cable.  I had to literally crumple the cord into the case to get the top closed.  Normally this would not bother me, except the SATA cord is very thick and acts like a spring when it's curled up inside that tiny space in the shape of an 'S'.  The SATA cord offers so much resistance that I had to force the top of the enclosure shut and hold it down tightly to fit the screws.    Also, the power cable runs an irritatingly short distance from the transformer to the plug for the enclosure.  The large block of a transformer is much closer to the enclosure side of the cable than the outlet plug side of the cable, which forces me to rest the transformer on my desktop next to the enclosure.  I see this as not only an eyesore, but also a safety issue for the enclosure, and perhaps the enclosed hard disk as well.  If the heavy transformer were pushed off the edge of the desk, it could take the enclosure with it, introducing a risk of shock damage to the hard disk.    On the positive side, this enclosure does securely support the hard disk with four small screws.  Not all enclosures have that feature.    I'd like to test the IDE interface, but I'm afraid of putting unnecessary strain on the enclosure.",

They could sell me anything if it was a pretty color.Haha.<br />But seriously,this is a firm well made cover.<br /><br />PART 2 same day,just more comments.<br /><br />It is extremely comfortable holding it to read. It folds back perfectly. One comment was it doesn't stay.<br />That comment can not be on this product. It can't be ! I tried it in every position of the complaints.<br />Another comment was it wasn't comfortable to hold while reading.That is just impossible to describe that as uncomfortable.<br />It feels great,largely to the fact it's so flat. That is a very high point on this. It folds flat.<br /><br />Another complaint was it is cheaply made. That is just not fair to say. This product could be owned by Apple and sell for double<br />price,I would pay it !  My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has the original cover from when I bought it. Feel that on your Smart phone.<br />It feels the same and actually looks the same. And there is no cheapness on that !! Now listen again. It is the same in every way<br />of quality as my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 cover(NOT THE KNOCK OFFS). It feels,it folds,it looks exactly like that case.<br />So if you know somebody with that phone,check the cover.<br /><br />Other comments were it looks almost dark blue. What ?????? This is a beautiful black. Black !!!<br />Another comment was the shut down didn't work when cover down. I say this works better than my mega expensive Big IPAD cover shutting down.<br />it is very,very responsive.<br /><br />Look carefully on the front,the left hand corner. Does it say Poetic? And sort of a cross look to the logo before word Poetic.<br />I am saying,I have bought 2 kindles,big,little,I have 3 IPADS plus a mini.<br />And a box full of equipment. And one thing still holds true. You get what you pay for.<br />This purchase is an exception. It's better than the original.<br /><br />Here is what i think is happening.<br />Amazon deserves an F for keeping things accurate on description of products. They have 10 year old comments<br />about products that have improved and have nothing to do with the comments.<br />I was furious with them recently for not being accurate on The Sopranos box set. They didn't give a damn<br />that one set had 33 discs,soundtracks etc from series before 2009,ands the other boxed different,cheaper,smaller,no soundtracks,etc.<br />That's a pretty big issue I think. Amazon has done zero to fix that. My point is this.<br />I think that all of us are talking about different products,some made here,some made there,quality went to hell when<br />made in China,whatever. But I am telling you flat out. The comments that are negative about this product are simply not true.<br />A lot of the negative comments I even tried to put my mini and case thru some positions to see if I could find a negative statement.<br />I couldn't. This is probably the best buy money wise,but more important quality wise than 95 % of the cases sitting in a box.<br /><br />I took my expensive case off,and put this on and that is where it will stay.<br /><br />I can give you a recommendation for your mini on another product that's soft that's cute,many different angle folds,<br />feels good in your hands,bla bla bla. BUT is is not a protection case,only a cover that shuts it down.<br />It's called iHOME. It has firm back soft front and this thing folds galore. The only negative thing there is you need to remove power cord and shut case then put cord back. Duh..like that's hard. But i want to be accurate.<br />Again it's called iHOME. They sell the little round black globe mono sound system.<br /><br />But if you think it's on par with the Poetic,it's not. I paid double for that i might add. Poetic half the priceand twice<br />the quality. So read it all,it took me quite a while. But it became clear almost right along that a seller or multiple sellers are<br />selling a cheap knock off and using the orginal favorable ad on Amazon. That is common,did you know that ? Particularly with<br />everything electronic. China is taking all our money,don't you think they could at least give you your money's worth ?<br /><br />This has thousands of reviews..it would be very easy to slip in some junk on unsuspecting customer. But when I opened the heavy plastic box<br />this was in,I knew it was a winner immediately,it just looked good ! Thank you for reading,sorry if i bored you. But I would never mislead<br />you.",

The 17\\\\\" screen is stunning, even keeping in mind that other makers have copied the idea (Apple's overall presentation simply outclasses the copycats' efforts), and the design and construction are first class. <br />I purchased the new 17\\\\\" PowerBook to replace the previous 15\\\\\" model. The increase in processor speed is noticeable, and I love the new trackpad which incorporates vertical and horizontal scrolling simply by touching the pad with two fingers instead of one. It is immediately easy to use--no extra buttons to manipulate or odd procedures to learn. The screen seems brighter than the previous one, and the new keyboard backlighting is beautiful. <br />I also like the fact that, besides increasing the base amount of memory, Apple now ships the machines with one memory slot open. That is, a standard 512MB machine has one 512MB strip on board, with one slot open. I simply took the \\\\\"extra\\\\\" 512MB strip out of my previous machine and put it in the new one, giving me a full 1GB of memory (upgradable to 2GB for those planning missions beyond the galaxy or whatever). <br />Buyers of the new 17\\\\\" PowerBook should also check out the Apple/Brenthaven shoulder bag and backpack. I opted for the backpack this time. It is beautifully crafted; easily worth the slight additional cost over the standard fare, especially since the computer sleeve is made specifically for this computer. <br />In sum, this is not an \\\\\"intermediate\\\\\" tweak; it is a serious upgrade of an already-great product.",

While I think it is hard for a long-time iOS user to switch to Android, the Samsung Galxy Tab S could be the one to switch or additional tablet device you want to get.<br /><br />I will not attempt to evaluate Android 4.4 here, as there are more qualified people who can do that. If you are used to iOS operating system it is unlikely that you will switch platform because of the latest Android.  If you are used to Android in your phones or other Android tablets, congratulation! You now have a tablet device choice that is far superior in term of physical features and technology than any currently in the market.  The iPad Mini Retina (which I own) is in the same price range but doesn't even come close.<br /><br />This tablet is a joy to use.  Watching a high definition video on this tablet is a whole new amazing experience. Colors are richer and pictures are so sharp you could not believe it can get to that level. Playing the same video side by side with the iPad Mini retina or iPad 3 and you could tell the differences. The iPad 3 used to have the best screen in all tablets, but no longer. Next to Galaxy S, you would think it is almost dull and boring.  I have heard of AMOLED , now I am totally convinced this is the new standard for tablet devices. Playing a video is as easy as clicking on the video file to play it after setting the default player the first time.<br /><br />The Galaxy Tab S comes with only 16GB or 32 GB, but you can add an additional of 128GB of storage via a microSD slot on the side. There is not many 128GB microSD card available and still expensive, but with 64GB card, you could get to 80GB of total storage. Total cost: $440 versus $600 for a 64GB iPad mini retina and $699 for iPad Air. Adding a 128GB microSD card (around $120) is still cheaper than a 64GB version of either above iPads.<br /><br />My Nexus 7 is only $220 but hardly belong in the same league. Nexus 7 has no rear camera, no storage expansion option and drained the battery so fast I have to charge it twice a day! A Nexus on full charge, leave in idle, would be dead in about 2 days. So on battery consumption, the Galaxy Tab S has about the same performance as the iPad's .<br /><br />The camera app in the Galaxy Tab S is far superior to one on the iPad. There are several modes to chose from, most interesting is Dual Camera. You could imprint the image of the front camera to one taken by rear camera! How cool is that?? Image quality is about the same, but of course they look gorgeous on another level when viewing on the Galaxy Tab S.<br /><br />The Galaxy Tab S is thin and light. So thin that I constantly worry that I would drop it.  There is no cover/case for it yet and I hope the future cases have cut-outs for the tablet's stereo speakers. They are located on the side of the tablet, I constantly cover them with my fingers!<br /><br />I am sure Apple will come up with something clever, hopefully in the same price range to stay competitive. Right now, this table is the reigning king of all tablets due to it price range, features and  most importantly, it gorgeous screen.<br /><br />7/1/14 update: WiFi performance on the Galaxy Tab S is superb; I streamed the same Nextflix movie to the Galaxy and iPad's side by side and the Galaxy really shined. While the iPads continued to buffer and finally gave up and displayed the movie in standard resolution, the Galaxy played the movie in HD with no hick-ups.

This is my first personal APU build and I was fairly impressed with this little guy, it did better then most cheap (&#60;100$) video cards would've done. When it came to compiling (I use Gentoo) it kept up pretty well as well. In single threaded compiling against against a 4.7ghz 1100t it was about 10% slower. Of course you throw 4 parallel jobs at it and you're looking at least 25% slower. This card DOES get hot though. And by hot - I don't know why they included that crappy - not even piped heatsink with it. I threw on the heatsink with the heat pipes that came with my 1100t and it dropped the temps a good 10\u00b0c (to about 40\u00b0c) at idle, 15-20\u00b0 at load (about 70\u00b0c). It overclocks okay, I played around with it on my Asus motherboard and was able to squeeze about 200mhz more out of it without bumping up the cpuv or temps that much. Unfortunately since I have a really small console case in an entertainment center heat is a concern. Perhaps if I work out a small corsair water cooling system in there I could squeeze some more speed out of it.

After the update, the sound prefane doesn't maintain settings to combine with 'Display Audio' and comes across muddled, as I would imagine the audio source is stuck between 'Built-In Audio' and 'Display Audio'. I would have rated the product a 4 or 5 prior to my experience with Mountain Lion (10.8), as it was low profile and delivered what was expected.<br /><br />I have spoken with Twelve South customer service and received beta drivers and a few generic troubleshooting tips (e.g. using the uninstallation program and reinstalling the package fresh, connecting/reconnecting the audio source, booting with [[ASIN:B005G2R0AU Twelve South (12-1109) BassJump 2]] connected or connecting after OS has loaded) over the course of several months, but to no avail. After months of it not working, it's back in the original box, presumably waiting to be given to a friend or family member who is uninterested or incapable of updating to 10.8.

The cases are sturdy and appear well-made. They have two rubber decorative strips that prevent slippage on your desk. And MacAlly generously provides 3 cables - SATA, USB2, and FireWire. They also include a little plastic stand that lets you position the case vertically. Very nice.    Here are some other details about this drive, the good and not so good:    1) You have to unscrew the case to open it and insert your drive (of course). Unfortunately whoever screwed the case together fastened the screws really really tight. I have had to return more than one MacAlly enclosure because I couldn't get the screws off!      2) Once the enclosure is open, you attach 4 cushioned screws to the side of your drive. These fit neatly into a metal rim in the case and provide some shock absorption for your drive - a very nice touch.     3) There are two cables you attach to connectors on your SATA drive. The connectors themselves slide easily into their sockets on the drive. However they are on cables attached to the innards of the enclosure and IMHO very poorly placed. To attach each cable, you need to twist it upside down. One of the cables is very stiff. It makes it tricky to place into the sockets. It also stresses the cable and makes it rise up rigidly. Then to close the case, you have to press really hard to squish the cable down, all the while wondering if you are damaging the cable or other components. Most enclosures, MacAlly or not, have a small space to work in. This one puts a lot of cable in a small small space.",

The only problem I have with this screen protector is that it's a little too thick to allow for easy docking of the tablet with the keyboard, it tends to scrunch up a bit and you can't really smooth it back out. I would suggest to the manufacturer that consideration be given in future to possibly having cut outs where the docking tabs align, similar to what is done for the front facing camera lens.",

If you don't know it yet, many popular PC games are going to a live-on demand process, which means that the game engine is stored on your HD but content that you encounter in the game world is requested from your hard drive as a result of communications with online servers.  What this means is that the server is constantly requesting information from your hard drive to be displayed in the game world.  In real time, this creates micro stutters and noticeable jumps and freezes as a traditional HDD spools up to read the platters.  A SDD does not have this spool up issue and therefore many of the games that you are used to seeing micro stutters and jumpy graphics instead play smooth as butter.  I learned this fact by careful research and then it was proven to me when I purchased and implemented this SSD. Specifically I play World of Tanks and Diablo 3, both of which are improved quite a lot with this SSD.<br /><br />It comes with access to software that makes it easy to clone your existing HD.  You can even migrate your entire OS to this HD and then make your computer boot from this new drive, which will allow you to turn your old HDD into a storage device!  This is what I did and I'm never buying a traditional platter HDD for my OS/gaming ever again.",

After receiving the case, I went to stores in my area that carried the Kindle and compared this case to Amazon's case and the M-Edge - which were my other leading 2 choices.  This one was by far, thinner, lighter and slicker than the other two.  the cover is thin and molds extremely well to my Kindle.  The holders keep it in place and makes the buttons easy to reach.  I also love the look and feel of the leather, which I believe is better than Amazon's version.  I am happy I went with the better case for $10 less!

This lack of noise combined with exceptional gaming performance is why I love this graphics card. Sure, I can still hear the fans working when I'm pushing a game at 1080p resolution with all the detail settings maxed out, but the fans aren't so loud that i can't hear my wife or kids calling my name from outside my office (that was a problem with my old Radeon card).<br /><br />Add to this the fact that the GTX 660 supports my 3D monitor (for the handful of games I might want to play in 3D) and the GTX 660 supports streaming games to the Nvidia Shield and this is simply a fantastic card.<br /><br />Keep in mind this is a dual-slot card because of the large cooling block so make sure you have two open slots on your motherboard/case.

My plan for the DX was that it would be both a convenient reading tool and file for the papers that pile up over years. It succeeds at both these tasks superbly. I initially tried to make do with a standard sized reading device, a Sony E-Reader, because I thought touch highlighting capabilities would be very important. For me though, the small screen meant I typically had to manually remove the margins from articles and read them in landscape mode, cutting the article into 2 or 3 sections. It doesn't seem like such a big deal, but I found I ended up printing the articles and reading them that way and the device went unused.<br /><br />The DX is useless for annotating or highlighting PDFs.  However, I found this wasn't as big a problem as I initially suspected. When I need to make notes now, I do it on a separate pad of paper. It turns out this doesn't really impact the experience for me.<br /><br />What has surprised me, is how much I enjoy other aspects of the device. I find I read more articles on the spur of the moment, since I can usually dump them onto the kindle easily. I didn't anticipate how convenient it would be to only have to worry about making sure you have one thing with you, since it carries every article you've ever read with it. I didn't realize how convenient it would be for reading fiction, since before this I always just bought paper books. I like that I no longer think about the fact that a big hardcover fiction book is heavy, when I'm deciding whether or not to throw it in my bag, on the off-chance I have some downtime to read.<br /><br />Now I'm just worried it will break one day and Amazon will have discontinued the line...",

            "input": "Kindle Touch 3G.    What to say about the Kindle Touch 3G?  Well it was everything I hoped for, and more.  I love it!  Most of the things I here people complain about are things that can be fixed simply by getting used to using a touch screen.  The Kindle itself and the touch screen simply take some time to learn how to use it.    Is the Kindle Touch slow and sluggish, is the screen dull and gray?  No!  Only if you make them that way.    Brightness  Major Tip!  A lot of people have debated the screen brightness, background brightness and the color of the background.  The answer lies not in each Kindle being a little different but in the lighting.  Simply put the brighter the lighting the better your Kindle will look.  If your one of those people who puts 40 Watt bulbs in every light socket, draws the curtains closed, snaps the blinds closed and likes it dark(you know who you are out there) then needless to say, your going to be one of those people complaining about the screen not being bright and the background not being white.    I was very worried about the screen brightness before I bought it.  But I am very very happy with it.  If you use Daylight CFL light bulbs(The white lighted ones) the Kindle looks so much better.  Put the Kindle under almost any white florescent light and the Kindle looks great.  The bright white of the florescent bulbs makes the Kindle look like the bright Kindle you see in the Amazon photos.  So the better the lighting the better the Kindle looks.  If your Kindle looks grayish or yellowish its your lack of lighting.  The Kindle looks sharp under a bright incandescent  bulb, but I will concede that the Kindle doesn't look good under the yellowish CFL lights.  Like I said, try looking at your Kindle under all different types of light and you'll see I'm right, those people who complain about the Kindle being murky are probably not using bright enough of a light.  And of course it looks fantastic when your outside on a nice sunny day.    Angle.  If you angle your Kindle vertically(not side to side) and you do it slowly you'll see that the boldness and blackness of the lettering improves greatly when you hit just the right angle.  I find that if I angle the top of the Kindle up(toward you) very slightly the lettering looks even better.    Slow or Sluggish?  No way!  *** Biggest tip of all.  Stop chicken pecking!  Sometimes when you hit the menu button or the goto button and so on, the Kindle doesn't seem to respond.  Thus the complaint that its slow and sluggish.  This is what most people seem to complain about.  Again it's you, not the Kindle.  I was watching a friend of mine use his Kindle and he was trying to bring up the menu.  I swear he looked and sounded like a chicken pecking at seed.  The harder you poke or the harder you press down the less responsive the Kindle is.  Very very very lightly touch the Kindle and it will work so much better and will be faster to respond.  If you have the experience of tapping the menu several times and nothing happens, this is normal at first.  The menu or any other on screen button options will not respond if you strike at it or poke at it or even push down with hard pressure.  Imagine if I told you the Kindle screen was wired to explode if  you put too much pressure on the screen.  Think about how lightly you would touch the screen, and that is how lightly you should touch it.  I can get any of the menu and other on screen buttons to respond quickly and instantly and with only one try.  It's NOT called the Kindle peck, or the Kindle Poke or the Kindle Push or the Kindle Press, it's the Kindle TOUCH!    I bought a small stylus and that helps a lot.  The stylus is about and inch and a half long with a rubber tip and has a loop so it can dangle from your finger.  I don't use it to turn pages because that's not necessary, but I use it for just about everything else on the Kindle and it makes Kindling so much easier.  Especially on the on screen keyboard.  Again VERY lightly touch your Kindle, you don't have to peck at it or push down.  The touch aspect takes a couple weeks to get used to.  So don't use your Kindle for a few days and write a bad review the day after your Kindle arrives.  I can't emphasize enough buy a mini stylus, it makes a big difference!  You can by a full size stylus or a mini, and they come in all sorts of colors.  The stylus I purchased can be found here -  [....]    (Take note that this stylus can plug into the headphone jack, but this is a place holder, its not intended to be in the jack while your using it, the cord is way to short for that.  The cord is just meant to loop around your index finger.)    Battery  The battery life is based on an average of 30 minutes a day as described in the Amazon description.  So for me reading about 90 minutes to 2 hours a day, the Kindle lasted about 21 days.  That's fantastic when you compare it to a cell phone(especially a smart phone)  or almost any other electronic device that's rechargeable.  Keep something important in mind, the first week or two or so that you own your Kindle, you'll be playing around with it a lot, and that causes a lot of page refreshes and that zaps the battery life.  Judge your Kindle's battery life after the second charge and after your through playing with it, and settle in to more of a reading routine.  Also remember something else, it only takes about 3 hours to recharge, so big deal!  So what about those people who whine that the battery doesn't last that long.  Well . . .   1. The only two things on the Kindle that use battery power while it's on, are the Wi-fi/3G and the page refresh.  It is not an LCD screen.  It's E-Ink.   2. So if you keep the Wi-fi/3G turned on then your Kindle will suck the battery power faster.  So turn the Wi-fi/3G off!  You only need it when your downloading or syncing or searching the Kindle store, you don't need it when your reading.  NOTE - You turn the 3G off by turning the Wi-fi off.   3. Keep the pagerefresh at it's default setting, when you change it to refresh every page you are cutting 75% of the battery life.  Yes 75%.   4.  Don't turn your Kindle off!  Put it in sleep mode unless your going to be away for more that 3 days or so. When you turn the Kindle completely off it goes into an indexing mode, and that takes battery power.  Your Kindle uses little to no power in sleep mode. This is in the user guide.    Another tip I'll give goes counter intuitive to everyone else's tip.  When turning pages DON'T SWIPE.  Just lightly touch the screen, it works so much better.  When you swipe vertically up or down it makes it jump to the next or previous chapter, this is actually very handy.  But some people say they make it jump to the next chapter by mistake when trying to swipe to turn the page.  Like I said just a light touch and the page turns, save your swipes for chapter jumps.    Page Turn  I can see that some people might like the page turn buttons on the Nook or previous Kindle's, but frankly it takes almost no effort to touch the screen with your thumb to go to the next page. (Assuming it's in your right hand.)  I do this almost with out thought.  If your holding it in your left hand you can still do this very easy, you just have to stretch your thumb out a little.  You can go page forward and back and hold the Kindle in one hand, if your holding it with your left hand and holding at the bottom left corner.  Though as I said I see why some people might miss the page turn buttons.  But frankly for me it's just and unconscious effort to turn the page.  It's not like your being asked to do one hundred one armed push-ups or something!    Ghosting?  I personally don't see the ghosting, I know two other people who have Kindles and they never see it either.  If you do have a problem with it, the only choice is to change the page refresh to every page, but as I said this will chew up the battery.  I will say that about maybe once every couple weeks I might see a very slight distortion on a page, this can be fixed with a quick 1 second touch to put the Kindle in sleep mode and then a quick 1 second touch to bring it back.  But I only have seen this 2 or 3 times in the six weeks I've owned it.    To 3G or not to 3G  I bought 3G for some long complicated reasons I won't go into.  A lot of people who bought 3G because they travel a lot seem to regret it.  You can always download books before your trip.  But I do recommend the 3G if your one of those people or you know someone who can barely turn their computer on, doesn't even know what a router or Wi-fi is. I think for those people 3G is much better.  The fact that I can't surf the internet using free 3G(except the Amazon Kindle store and Wikipedia) doesn't bother me at all, it's an e-reader not a tablet, so get over it!  You can surf the web using Wi-fi mode.  For reasons of full discloser lets explain.  Using free 3G you can surf Amazon's Kindle store down load books and apps for free.  You can surf Amazons Kindle store and Wikipedia Free.  But you can't send documents or down load audio books with free 3G  But you can do these with either  Wi-fi or the USB Cable.  You can also surf the web with the Wi-fi.  Also don't forget you can buy books on your computer and purchase them, and then on your Kindle click the Home screen - menu - snc(with the Wi-fi/3G on), and you book/app will download.  Frankly it's a lot easier doing this on the computer then surfing the Kindle store on the Kindle.  It also saves your Kindle's battery life.    Special Offers  The screen saver is an ad, but frankly the ads look ten times better than the default ugly Amazon screen saver so who cares!  A small ad about the size of your pinky sits at the bottom of the home screen, its very tiny and out of the way.  And an ad may appear on Amazons Kindle store site your surfing, but how often do you do that?  And again the ad is small.  There are NO ads while your reading.  They are so irrelevant and amount tonothing, I think it's a brilliant way to lower the cost of the device in a bad economy.  It's hard to imagine any one who isn't a stuck up elitist having a problem with the ads.  I think it's actually interesting to see what's going to pop up in the screen saver next.  I'm sorry to be rude but if your offended by a couple of minor ads then pay $30 to $40 more and quit griping.    Features  One click on a word in a book, and the dictionary pops up.  Cool!  And very handy.  X-ray.  Well this one I've had limited experience with, not all books have X-ray.  It will give a chart telling you where a character appears in a book or chapter, click on the character and it will tell you more, or take you to a wikipedia article.  In some cases it will tell you more about a thing or place or event.  I believe this feature will be expanded as publishers get used to it.  You can bookmark and better yet, have multiple bookmarks.  You can make notes, and highlight text.  And so much more.    Another tip  It's amazing how many people buy the Kindle to read, but then don't read the user guide.  Yes sometimes it's fun with electronics to not read the user guide and learn as you go, but in this case read the user guide.(Which is in Ebook form on your Kindle.)    Nitpicks.  Okay so I guess I have to find something to complain about so you'll believe this is a real review.  Bookmarking is easy, just touch the top right corner and a small dog eared bookmark appears. (You can delete the bookmark the same way.  But retrieving bookmarks could be a tad easier, though it gets easier with time. You can find a page number(if the original book had page numbers) by clicking the menu then looking at the bottom of the page.  The option to have the page numbers there all the time would be nice.  And a book should start with the cover, but not on the Kindle?  When you click to read a book the cover doesn't pop up, it would just be cool if it did.  (You can see the cover by back paging or clicking gotoand then clicking cover.)     Over all I love it!  The ability to buy a book online, click sync on the Kindle and WHAM there it is on your Kindle is just so amazing.  No spending money on gas driving around town looking for that one book, and then trying to figure out what to do with the books after you read them.  So if your trying to decide to get the Kindle or not.  Go for it!  Get used to your Kindle for a couple months, get used to the touch screen, lightly touching not poking or pressing down hard.  Get a bright reading light.  You will love it.  You shouldn't by any electronic gadget, use it for a couple days then whine and suck your thumb in a bad review.  All gadgets take a while to learn and get used to.",

One thing about this pad however is that it is painfully loud. It makes a loud grinding sound any time you move the mouse across it, regardless of whatever side you are using, and it grinds away at the pads on the bottom of the mouse. While you can use the pad without the wrist rest, the rest itself is of disappointing quality. It is a pretty pad, and doesn't quite feel like gel, but rather rubber, and the Razer insignia printed on it is essentially a fabric sticker that rubs off after only a few hours to a day of use. There really isn't anything good to say about this pad with the exception of the fact that the Razer Synapse software has presets for mouse calibration with the Vespula in mind, making the mouse more accurate on the pad.

The noise was so annoying that I decided to replace it.<br /><br />Given that I built this PC in 2010 I said myself why not replace this with liquid cooling, from what I saw on Benchmarks from various websites the benefits were substantial to convince myself to spend $60 for this model, I needed something that can keep my CPU 30' Idle and less than 50' when gaming and quiet like the Cooler Master TPC 812 (I paid almost $80) that I use on my Main PC.<br /><br />Once I installed the H55 I was impressed with its cooling capability, In idle the CPU runs from 29 to 32 C' and when running games from BF3, NFS5 and Crysis 3 the PC did not pass 43 C'<br /><br />Now my disappointment was that the fan was louder than the AMD Stock fan, I was expecting this to be quieter given that this is the &#34;quiet&#34; edition liquid cooling. In the two floor house I could hear the PC running from the stairs.<br /><br />Luckily I had an extra spare fan Corsair SP 120 quiet edition (Now this fan is quiet as the name says) to replace the one that came with the H55, and the noise level went down substantially. I knew to not put weaker fans on the liquid coolers but the temps were unchanged with the SP120. I played Crisys 3 on with this fan and the temp did not pass 45 C'<br /><br />So In summary I can say liquid cooling will give you way better cooling capability vs High End Heatsinks. Now the other factor that come into play is noise. My Cooler Master TPC 812 is still quieter even though I'm using Push Pull  se-tup. So if noise is a concern better to have a quieter fan available just in case.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Excellent Cooling power 45 C' under full load<br />Its low Profile Grill makes it great for mid ATX Cases<br />Ease of Install<br />Water Pump takes less space and looks cool<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Noise<br /><br />PC used:<br /><br />AMD Phenom II 955<br />ASUS M4A87TD<br />AMD Radeon 6770 1GB<br />8 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 1600Mhz<br />1.5 TB WD Caviar Blackr Pump takes less space and looks cool<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Noise<br /><br />PC used:<br /><br />AMD Phenom II 955<br />ASUS M4A87TD<br />AMD Radeon 6770 1GB<br />8 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 1600Mhz<br />1.5 TB WD Caviar Black",

From the much larger screen size to the addition of Bluetooth and the ample 160GB hard drive,and the wonderful battery life (i'm averaging 6.5 hours on one charge so far...) this one puts most other netbooks in the dust.  I thought long and hard between this one and the Asus HE but I have a Samsung HDTV and the T260HD Monitor and I love them both so I went with this and I am very glad I did.  One other pleasant thing was how easy this was to network when I had room to install Windows 7 on it and networked it with our main computer.  I had to input one code and it works like a dream!  I dont do tech speak so you will probably get more out of other reviews but just suffice it to say that you will love this if you spend just the little bit extra.  And oh, NEVER buy HP.

I use several Logitech devices and they seem to never disappoint me.  The touch pad is attractive, useful wirelessly, and works extremely well with Windows 8.  One of the gotchas is that your hands would need to stay dry to take advantage of the finger swipes (however, this holds true for most touch pads).  The second gotcha is the left mouse click (for drag and drop features), you must have the touch pad on a flat service since the clicking occurs when you push down on the left corner of the touch pad  (you can actually hear the clicking when pressing).  Uneven surfaces makes it difficult to do a left mouse click because it requires &#34;hard&#34; pushing of the left corner of the touch pad on uneven surfaces.  Make sure to keep the touch pad on hard flat surface and this problem completely goes away.  Overall, I give this product a strong 8 (from 1 to 10).",

The reason I trashed it was a defect that my unit had where it would randomly act like the hyperspace button on the old asteroids video game. The cursor would just vanish and reappear somewhere else often when you'd go to do a right click. Well that unit was smashed into a thousand pieces in anger when it clicked on the wrong thing at the wrong time, but when I had ordered it I had ordered 2 of them. The second one has lasted this entire time in my media room with almost daily use. I can't say how many times it's dropped onto the tile floor and the battery door popped off and the batteries scattered across the floor and rolled under the couch, from on top of my eliptical machine even from 6ft up! But I put it back together and it keeps on ticking. So my first unit was a disaster and my second one has been bulletproof. Over the last 3 years I've gone through 4 other competitors to replace the smashed one and I've yet to find one as good. Now I have to say this thing isn't perfect, and it's NOT for desktop use. But it's ideal for when you don't have a platform to operate a separate keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Pros: over 3 years and still going strong of nearly daily use in my media room! Form factor, combined mouse and keyboard in the perfect sized package. Compared to others, pretty darn durable. not indestructible, but very forgiving. Very long battery life. Takes alkaline, no recharging. Replace batteries every 6 months is about it. Top row of media buttons, volume, play, mute etc. Oh and the range is pretty good too. Actually have no problem with range. Probably about 30ft.<br /><br />Cons: If they'd only make the trackball able to pop out for cleaning like other track ball mouses do. Eventually it gets little dust bunnies clogging up the sensors causing it to be sticky. About every 6 months I take it out to my shop and pull the screws out of the back, disassemble it and clean out the contacts. It's unavoidable really, unless you live in an intel clean room it's going to happen. One little stupid peeve is the volume buttons are backwards. Right is down and left is up. You get use to it, but ..<br /><br />So I'm knocking it one * for 50% failure rate in my personal case, and for not having a pop out trackball for cleaning.<br /><br />If this thing died for any reason, I'd have to order another one. I just haven't found anything as good. I have to say I've also tried the competitors with a trackpad figuring no sensors to clean, which is true, but it's way more fragile and I'm much more fluent with the trackball so despite my best efforts over 3 years to top this one, so far I can't.

It shouldn't matter who bought the product; if your stuff is malfunctioning within warranty then repair it. I'll never buy or ask for another Mionix product again.",

I have the receiver set in my monitor, and have no trouble or lag(I am also using the encrypted signal setting). The lcd(clear on black)is nice, you can read it better if you lean over it. It is not back lit, so leave the light on. I really like being able to set the presets for my favorite programs, fast launch/less clutter on screen. My only con with the key board is that some of the media keys below the LCD are a bit small for my fingers. I have no cons for the mouse.

However, I bought a cheap app off the app store called nPlayer (think it was 69p or around that) and once I added the SMB/CIFS network (which is 10.10.10.254 for verbatim mediashare devices, other devices may have a different default value)I found this app would stream ALL of my video's! MKV,AVI,MP4,DivX....the lot, perfectly, from either the SD card or a usb device (they both show up if plugged in)<br />This has made the device a joy to use.<br />I also found that for some reason, if you set up a wireless bridge, but the internet connection for this network is out of range, the mediashare device will sometimes constantly lose the connection to your device. By turning the wireless bridge feature off in these circumstances, via the settings, a constant connection is achieved (which i've found is also a bit quicker when copying files). The constant dropping of the connection to devices doesn't seem to happen when the internet bridge can connect to a strong reliable internet connection.<br />Hope this helps people, because when it's up and running correctly it's a device I wouldn't be without!",

I know, I know, e-ink and all that. Don't get me wrong, I actually prefer reading on my Kindle Keyboard even after having the Fire for a few weeks. Easier on the eyes (and battery life).  For what it's made for, the Fire is a pretty good device. I can't rate it excellent or even great because of two issues that are a big turn off for me.   The good- It's fun. Seriously, there is a lot to do on the Fire. You can read, watch tv shows and movies, play games or play on the web. It does what it says it will. It's a media hub. I have used it to check email, get on Facebook, watch shows on Netflix, play games and read mostly. It is responsive and I have had almost no bugs or issues like that. It's fast too. I love reading at night on it because I don't have to mess with a light hanging off the Kindle. I like how smooth the pages turn. Is this an \\\\\"iPad killer\\\\\"? No. I already have an iPhone so I have no need for a bigger version of the same device (I have never quite understood that). It's not marketed as an iPad, either. It's a much better size for portability and to hold comfortably. It's a great price. And it's Amazon, which I love!  Now my two BIG issues.   1. A complete and total lack of any way to organize your books. Seriously? My Kindle Keyboard can organize books, but the Fire doesn't? I have a lot of books on my device and I would like to keep all my books on it. I am a bit OCD about my organization and this is almost a deal breaker for me. I have seriously considered not using it because I don't like having to scroll through hundreds and hundreds of books. Use the search feature? Sure, that may work if you know what you are looking for. For me, though, when I finish a series I don't always know what I want to read next. On my old Kindle I had everything sorted by Author and as I finished a book Ideleted it. On the Fire I feel so lost in between a series that I ended up pulling all my books off via Calibre and just loading one author's books. Very frustrating. Amazon seriously needs to not only add collections, but an easy way of putting books into collections.   2. The Carousel. I mean, I actually like the carousel. Although it is a bit touchy sometimes. But the front screen should be customize-able.  I don't want every book in my library showing on my main screen. I also do not need someone to see every web page I have visited. I know I can clear history, but seriously who wants to do that every time they visit a page? I have two teens that play with my Fire from time to time and I am unable to hand it over without some concerns about privacy.   Obviously a software update would fix both of these issues. Perhaps options for the front screen selecting what you wish to show, and what you don't would be a good start.  All in all the Fire is a great device. However, if you are concerned about being able to organizing your books or privacy issues, you might want to wait and see if these issues are addressed.",

The inside is well designed (I counted some 15 pockets of all sizes, but I may have missed some), and generously padded.  The only quips I have so far are very minor: I would have liked a few larger pockets (most of them are only large enough to put a power supply in -- the brick size kind I have for my laptop), and well... aesthetically, it's not bad (mostly because the all-black exterior is discreet), but definitely looks industrial.

I did notice, as the unit heated up, i would begin to notice intermittent connectivity between my computer and the array.  If you want a USB3 enclosure, THIS is NOT the enclosure you want. This RAID Array works fine when connected to a USB2 port (recognition by the computer, file transfer R/W) but when connected to the USB3 port of my computer (MSI GT70 laptop) the enclosure is not recognized by the computer, mounting and un-mounting repeatedly till I remove the enclosure from the USB3 port. I have looked for firmware updates for both my laptop as well as the enclosure, the laptop is working fine with other USB3 hard drives I have. Though I do not have another device to confirm the issue with the Dyconn enclosure, I still recommend you find another manufacturer if you want a USB3 enclosure, If you're fine with the enclosure running USB2, then it will do what you need.  An amendment to this review is the fan, I have already gone through 2 of these units already, and the fan is beginning to fail again with a sound similar to something that is unbalanced. I will most likely keep this unit and replace the fan myself, as it does work as a decent usb2 storage device.

I bought this router because the Cisco RV-120 was poorly reviewed, but I don't think this one is any better. It is on it's original firmware however, so maybe there's hope in the future.<br /><br />The static IP/DHCP reservation setting was a little strange in that it wouldn't let you set static IP's outside the DHCP range of addresses. You can work around that by temporarily widening the DHCP address range, reserving the static IP's, and then restoring the normal DHCP range.<br /><br />The firewall can't be turned off as far as I can tell. That might have been nice since this is now just a standalone VPN server and wireless AP for me now. Only on my second day of that duty, but so far so good. I have created a PPTP VPN link from a Windows 7 computer to the router with no problems. However, I have no Internet through the VPN when this router's WAN is not connected.<br /><br />It wants to run the setup Wizard every time you log in to the router. One or two extra clicks to get to something useful.<br /><br />All pretty good, except it needs that reboot pretty frequently. I look forward to a firmware update.

As far as the network adaptor, I didn't have a clue about that, but apparently it's there.  The mouse works on Wi-Fi, and does not tie up a USB port.  I connected up my external disk drive to the Asus, popped in the mini-disk, and closed the drive.  The software loaded quickly.  Following the pictorial instructions included, I pulled the tab from the mouse battery case, turned the switch to \\\\\"On\\\\\" and I had a functional mouse.  No problems whatsoever.  This is the first wireless mouse I've ever used.  It's pretty big and oddly shaped, but not uncomfortable to use.  It has a touch scroll where a wheel would be.  Right now, I have to say I prefer a wheel to the touch scroll, but it might be I just have to get used to it.  The packaging says that the \\\\\"Innovative touch scroll adjusts to the speed of your finger to get you there fast.\\\\\"  Well, maybe with a bit more practice that will be true.    The mouse has six buttons, allowing you to create shortcuts.  The box also claims \\\\\"precision laser tracking\\\\\" that works on almost any surface, except possibly glass.  Battery life of nine months is claimed.  As noted above, batteries were already installed, and had to be activated by pulling the tab.  I didn't open the case to see what kind of batteries they were (and it didn't say anywhere on the packaging that I could find) but the on-line write-up says the mouse uses two standard AA batteries.  One drawback to a wireless mouse is the need to remember to turn it off when not in use.  I'm not sure the advantages of having a wireless device make up for this mild nuisance, for me anyway.  But the mouse itself is fine, and worked for me practically right out of the box.",

I decided to go ahead and get one because I had lost most of my books when I had to move and could not bring them with. I felt that with the copious amount of books that I have bought in the past and having no intention of stopping that behavior, it would be best for me to get all of the books I previously owned on a Kindle. This should negate the worry of needing to replace my library should something untoward happen again. I will still purchase certain books in print, but far fewer than before and likely duplicated on my Kindle as well.<br />Thus far I have been nothing but pleased with my purchase. The display is clear and bright, with no issues whether I am reading in the dark before bed or waiting for the bus on a sunny day. All of the books I have downloaded so far have done so quickly to the point of being almost instantaneous. The ability to change the size of the font I could see as being particularly useful for people with poor eyesight, which I will undoubtedly have later in life since I read in the dark. I am particularly a fan of the built in dictionary that allows you to highlight a word while reading just by touching the word and have the definition come up in a pop-up window. This saves me some time as I like to look up any words I am unfamiliar with. Additionally, I enjoy the ability to highlight passages while I am reading and then be able to access all of my highlighted passages in one location. When I read something I find particularly insightful or beautiful I always mean to write it down or memorize it for later use. The highlight feature makes this process much more convenient.<br />I am very pleased with my Kindle and would recommend it to anyone who was interested. My one complaint is a small one and has nothing to do with the quality of the product. Rather it is a complaint on thechoice of model I have. I would like to be able to view the covers of my book in color to better appreciate the artwork. I chose the paperwhite model without realizing how much I would want that after the fact. Always has to be some complaint though, I guess. Mine is due to my own lack of foresight, at least.",

There is also a way now to select and copy and paste text from ebooks using the google search tool.<br />Your Goodreads review shows up at the end of the book. The font inside book menus is still way too small and light gray, hard to read (definitions and translations, love the translator too). There is still also no way to customize the screen when reading except for the three colors they had before. I downloaded a screen dim app to dim the screen while reading and use sepia and that seems to help reduce eye strain.<br />I also tried the whole whispersync thing through Audible. It's expensive and confusing but nice if you like to listen to books. The speaker could be louder, but it does have a headphone port.<br />The text to speech works awesome.<br />You can also take a screengrab jpg file by pressing and holding the volume down and power off button at the same time.<br />The only thing I don't like is the lack of Google Apps. You can't even sideload them, it's very proprietary. If you are Amazon friendly, it's no big problem, but it will be annoying for i people to try to switch over. And you have to download a file management browser, like ES file browser to get to your files.<br />I bought mine at Best Buy for $350 in January 2014.<br />I love my new Kindle Fire HDX and can not imagine how I read for so long on my previous gen 7&#34;.

It's easy to put on, and possible, though not easy to get off (which is kind of the point). It has a nice feel to it and leaves all ports open as designed. I only have two minor reasons for giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. one, there was a slight blemish, sort of like a thin spot, in the coating. You can't really see it when it's on the computer, and I bought it to make it grippier/easier to handle, so I decided I was fine with it. The second is that if you use your MacBook a lot so that your wrists/arms rest on the front edge of the case, this added case has two little 1/2\\\\\" clips along that edge, about 1\\\\\" from either side of the trackpad, that leave lines in my skin and are pretty uncomfortable for me. However, I do have sensitive skin, and my sessions of using this without an external keyboard or in an uncomfortable position are limited to trips and a couple other occasional circumstances. Still, I think it is something to consider for many users.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a few-to-several months (depending on how much you carry your MBP around) the corners will start to chip. The left corner of the monitor is now actually pretty rough and snags on fabric. Overall it's still making it less slippery, but, put this money toward a higher quality product and pass on this one.

What are the things I really like about it?<br /><br />First of all, this keyboard is NOT beset with the problem that a number of others in this category suffer from: putting punctuation marks either on other keys than they are normally found, or in other places on the keyboard than normal, or, worst case...BOTH. It sounds like a simple thing, but in addition to adjusting to a smaller keyboard in some cases, also having to adjust to your most-needed punctuation keys being out of whack is a problem I don't need. With the 806, this problem doesn't come up.<br /><br />Also, I have to keep up with recharging enough gear in my life, so the fact that it runs (A LONG TIME according to some other reviewers) off two AAA batteries is a real plus. In addition, there is an LED that will warn you when the battery is getting low.<br /><br />Is it \\\\\"lappable\\\\\" (i.e., can you spread it out on your lap with no surface underneath it)? Contrary to some other reviewers who said \\\\\"No\\\\\", I found it to work fine when spread out on my legs. I do tend to use a stiff, flat surface for comfort though (the cardboard surface of an 8.5x11\\\\\" binder positioned in landscape mode works fine).<br /><br />The 806 has a compact profile when folded (5 7/8 x 4 x 5/8\\\\\" dimensions). I personally want the keyboard to be as compact as possible when folded up while still meeting my other requirements. This keyboard fits the bill nicely. Also, it is built solidly (some parts and hinges are made out of aluminum). WARNING: Don't think of it as near indestructible though. Unfortunately, mine dropped to a tile floor from about waist high and a small piece of plastic broke off, preventing the folding mechanism from working as smoothly as it did when intact. I am, however, still able to use the keyboard fully and without problem...just a bit of a hassle when re-folding.<br /><br />Finally, whereas some unfolded folding keyboards have a bizarre placement and size of some of the keys in the middle (going left to right) of the keyboard to allow for the folding mechanism, when you look straight down on the 806 from above when unfolded, it looks pretty much just like your normal desktop or laptop keyboard. This is a really big plus since you don't have to get used to odd, middle-of-the-keyboard key placement and spacing.<br /><br />OKAY, SO THAT'S THE GOOD. WHAT'S THE BAD (OR AT LEAST THE NOT SO GOOD)?<br /><br />Although the row of numbered keys above the top row of letters has all of the keys (and their shifted punctuation marks) where you would expect them sequentially (in a row from left to right), they are placed just about a key's width to the right of where your fingers would normally reach to if you are a touch typist. This has the effect of causing the mis-typing of those numbers or punctuation marks until you've spent a LOT of time on the keyboard. Also on this same row, the Backspace key is small enough to be hard to locate from your touch typing position...at first. I would note however, that having used the keyboard a lot by now, I find that I have been able to largely adjust to this issue and it's not so big a deal as it was in the first days and weeks of use.<br /><br />Here's one that could be a deal killer if you plan on using this keyboard for entering some network addressing characters, or performing some operating system commands on your iPhone. The \\\\\"pipe\\\\\" (|) symbol and the backslash (\\) key DOES NOT WORK when paired with my iPhone 4S and iOS version 6.1.3 (10B329). I have paired the keyboard with my MacBook Pro and this key works just fine. Also, it works fine when paired with a Samsung Galaxy III. So whether this is a problem with all iOS devices, I do not know as I have no way to test on an iPod Touch or an iPad. I alerted the keyboard maker (Perixx) to this situation and they told me to check the same key on other devices to see if it might be the key itself or just one or more devices on which it won't work while working on others. I did, and reported my findings. I then asked them to get back with me after presenting these findings to their engineers so I could have their feedback before writing this review. I did not hear back on this request after allowing several weeks.<br /><br />Finally, a small thing but one that should be mentioned. There is no LED to let you know when the keyboard is in the Caps Lock state. Not a big deal, but one that is a bit annoying I must confess.<br /><br />BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE \\\\\"IT'S JUST TOO SMALL/CRAMPED AND I WISH I HADN'T BOUGHT IT\\\\\" REVIEWS?<br /><br />When I was searching for just the right keyboard, these were the reviews that worried me most. Fortunately, I can report that at least for me, the tightness of the key sizing and arrangement on the 806 IS something to which one can become accustomed. As long as I put my brain in \\\\\"tighten up your touch typing home row resting and reach positions\\\\\" mode, I find that I can type almost as well as I can on a normal sized keyboard. It does require a little bit of extra brain power though. But \\\\\"What about MY hands?\\\\\" you may ask. So I will finish this review by giving you some hard numbers that might help you make your decision.<br /><br />When I took a ruler and set it on my Apple, wired external keyboard with keypad's \\\\\"home row\\\\\" (ASDF, etc.) and measured the horizontal distance from the left-to-right middle of the \\\\\"A\\\\\" key, to the left-to-right middle of the Apostrophe/Double Quote key, I got the following: 7.5 inches. When I made the same measurement on the PERIBOARD-806, I got the following: 6.5 inches. Okay, so that's the keyboard's dimensions but how big are my hands? If I hold my left hand flat with palm down, and squeeze from my pinky finger on the left to my index finger on my right when looking down on my hand from above, from the left edge of my pinky's fingernail to the right edge of my index finger's fingernail is exactly 2.5 inches. So how does this apply to you? I would say that if you hold one of your hands in the manner described above, take the same measurement I described, and the distance is greater than 2.5 inches, then this keyboard's layout would *probably* be too small for comfortable, efficient use since my own hand size is probably right on the upper limit for a good match for the 806. Also, if you would be using this keyboard for heavy number entry, I would say you had better think hard about using ANY keyboard that doesn't have a dedicated keypad.<br /><br />So as for me, though it requires resetting my brain just a little and tightening up my touch typing stance, I have found the 806 to more than meet my needs and be a really good fit for portable, non-charging-hassle, durable use.",

I am definitely a book addict, and my bookshelves are mostly full. I'm also someone who likes to take more than one book with me when I go somewhere because I never know which one I might need/want. The Kindle helps me with both of these; I can buy more books without needing more bookshelves, and I can carry literally dozens of \\\\\"books\\\\\" with me without a problem.    I've had my eye on the Kindle for as long as they've been available. One of the reasons I hesitated to buy one was that it didn't seem like many books I needed/wanted were available for it. Well, the selection has gotten better, and many of the books I look for actually are available in Kindle editions (including many of the professional books I need).     Since I've been known to be an \\\\\"impulse buyer\\\\\" when it comes to books, it doesn't hurt that not everything I look for is available in this format--I've decided that unless it's a book that I'm required to buy for some reason, I won't get it if it's not available in a Kindle edition!    The other really really cool thing about having a Kindle is the \\\\\"instant gratification\\\\\"--I can decide to buy a book, order it, and get it immediately, rather than having to wait for it to be shipped to me. This has come in handy more than once already...I'm getting spoiled :-)    Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, you have to be careful how you hold it, or you'll move forward or back a page without meaning to. Also, I'm still getting used to not being able to just flip through a book to find the next chapter, etc.--the electronic format isn't quite as comfortable for me in this respect. I know there are lots of handy Kindle features that I haven't explored yet, though, so I'm sure there are ways to get around things like this. I also like being able to \\\\\"highlight\\\\\" and \\\\\"unhighlight\\\\\" at will (without feeling guilty for marking up a book). There are also sometimes errors in the Kindle editions of books that weren't in the originals--so far, just a minor annoyance.    As other reviewers have mentioned, the [[ASIN:B000HGGA24 Case Logic HDC-1 Medium EVA External Hard Drive Case (Black)]] works very well for carrying the Kindle and accessories. I also bought the [[ASIN:B001EVVYQS MiniSuit Silicone Skin Case for Amazon Kindle with Adjustable Stand (Black)]]. It works OK, although you have to be careful how you set up the stand so that it doesn't fall over (the part of the case that has the stand attached is not stiff, so it doesn't stay still).    So, anyway, go ahead...take the plunge...buy a Kindle!",

These flights are no less then 11 hours and some can be up to 15 hours.<br />My Apple 13\u201d MacBook Air laptop computer has a great battery life. Usually about 8  hours (in the real world) but even that falls short of my needs. After extensive research, I selected this battery because they are the ONLY one who include the magsafe & magsafe2 connectors needed to plug into my computer. They offer the maximum amount of battery power without exceeding the TSA international limit of 100 Wh. This battery just makes it at 98 Wh.<br />  TESTING: I depleted my laptop battery down to 6% . Then I plugged in the BIXNET battery to see what it can really do on a full charge.<br />The results were;  it fully recharged my laptop internal battery in 2 hours and at the same time provided playing mp4 movies for 4 hours, all at the same time.<br />  NOTE: The battery charging instructions in the box were not accurate as to how this recharge function happens. On my battery and charger, the power brick always remains glowing with a red LED. Regardless of the charge in the battery. While the charge is being accepted, the 4 bars do build to show that the charge is growing. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALLY WATCH THE LITTLE BATTERY ICON FLASHING IN THE LED BATTERY WINDOW. After showing all 4 bars, the icon is STILL flashing. That indicates that the battery has NOT YET topped off. Let it remain charging until the battery icon STOPS flashing. Then you know your battery is FULLY CHARGED<br />  CONCLUSION: What more could you ask for extending the operation of a full laptop computer. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs the extended laptop life on battery power.<br />Well done BIXPower.",

I do have a non-slip protector on my phone, but I had no problem securing it to my case.  The magnet is strong and my phone has never had a problem staying on the mount.  I love that I can rotate it per my needs.  Horizontal for GPS and emails/internet (never while driving!!) and vertical when I made video calls and apps.<br /><br />I drive around constantly and live in a climate that is very temperamental, so I was looking for a dashboard holder that would hold up with my schedule and not falter with below zero temperatures or heat & humidity.  I have only been able to test it out in the 20s and 70s, but the dashboard mount stayed secure. The base of the suction is sticky, making it hold very secure.  My phone stayed in place over speed bumps, and other bumps and turns.

            "input": "We have more than a dozen of these monitors at work and I have two on my desk and one at home. The monitors arrive with an enclosed calibration sheet. Apparently they are factory calibrated now. Because I work on media I needed a color accurate monitor that could also double as a day to day working display for coding, presentations and documents. Out of the box these monitors required less calibration work than any LCD monitor or TV that I've used in the past five years. I saw none of the pink or green tinge referred to in other reviews. Nor was there any noticeable graduation of color tint from one side to another. In fact side by side the monitors appear perfectly matched and even.<br /><br />The color from these monitors is very neutral, which is to say quite accurate. While they are not 'reference' quality they don't fall far short of the mark. For the price they are a good deal. You should be aware that IPS is known for accuracy and range of colors. The display is not LED backlit, because LED's do not allow the full range of colors you get from older monitors. This was a deliberate choice and the correct one. If you want to go green and simply don't care about color accuracy or vertical viewing angle, get something like the Dell G2410H.<br /><br />Watching bluray disks on this monitor is also a very satisfying experience - be warned that the color neutrality does not make this display as flashy as a TV or TN monitor, but what you get in return is accuracy. At home I do some moderate gaming so I watch out for latency, especially the whole-screen refresh which is always much worse than the stated response times. This is a 6mS display and I've seen it switch whole screen refresh in about 20-25mS. While this may not seem good, it is in fact considerably better than average. Anytime you see a claim of 2mS switching time, be aware it is like saying an amplifier produces 200W of \\\\\"music power\\\\\" where in fact it manages maybe 25W RMS at best. So gaming is very satisfactory although not a reason to buy this class of monitor.<br /><br />In terms of performance, the processor behind these displays seems faster than almost anything else I've seen. The OSD is easy to use and better thought out than my 2408WFP displays. I like that the OSD puts the function graphics right next to the corresponding buttons (so for example you get a tic mark against the button used to accept a setting).<br /><br />The connections for the monitor include 2 DVI, 1 display port and an hdmi port. As usual the hdmi input stops edid/hdcp support when you switch away to another DVI input. This is annoying for various reasons, but most people won't care.<br /><br />I particularly loathe TN displays due to their poor color accuracy and ridiculous vertical viewing angles. So 100% of my monitors at home and work are either PVA or IPS types. I have eight at home, including HP and Samsung. I still think that Dell peaked with the 2408 but this IPS display is a worthy successor and for the price point a good deal. I would assume if you are looking here it's because you want an exceptional monitor rather than the high street vanilla variety. If so, you should be very happy with this monitor. It is not far short of perfect.<br /><br />Dell has fallen from grace in recent years, in no small part due to a deteriorating web site and fierce competition. Dell's website is undermined by lack of consistency, poor navigation, stupid base configurations and a pricing structure that is undermined when you find you can buy a pre-configured machine through a retail outlet at a cheaper price than you can build the equivalent machine online. Their product lines are also poorly differentiated from their competitor's machines. But their monitors are second to none. Almost a good enough reason to buy a Dell system.a reason to buy this class of monitor.

Reinspecting the first failed DIMM, I noticed that the plastic tray had an extra barcoded label slapped on that the second one didn't.

Battery life: 10/10  +/-3 hours in High Performance Mode (GeForce G210M graphics)  6+ hours in Entertainment Mode (intergrated Intel Graphics)  8+ hours in Battery Saving Mode (intergrated Intel Graphics)  And the laptop is smart enough to stop charging as soon as it gets to 100% charge. This way it wont overcharge and damage the battery.    Graphics: 10/10  Prior to testing Portal, I toggled to the GeForce 210 graphics card. Portal plays very well at 720p at maximum settings with AA off. Very impressive for a laptop that is 3.94lbs (yes i weighed it). 98% of the time I'm not playing games, so it nice to be able to save battery until you want to play games.    Build: 10/10  I bought this because I'm a college student. I needed something powerful and light. The discrete graphics card is perfect for games. It's made with alimunum and feels very sturdy.    Features: 9/10  Think of the 9/10 as a good thing. So first off the hardware: it's got a webcam, microphone, VGA out, and HDMI out. It doesn't have a DVD-ROM, but that was a tradeoff.  If you want the DVD-ROM built-in, buy the UL80-A1, but be warned, the UL80-A1 is heavier, more cheaply built and cost about the same. I just bought an external DVD-ROM.  The sound card has the ability to record in Stereo Mix, this was a HUGE plus for me. Stereo Mix record allows you to record streaming audio at any point.  The BOIS does mild overclocking and OS virtualization (like running XP inside Windows 7). And you can set it to enable USB bootability.  The ONLY reason I gave \\\\\"Features\\\\\" a 9/10 was because the wifi card isn't recognized in Backtrack 3, which is like Linux for network hackers. But... 99.5% of people probably won't be using for Backtrack 3. BTW it still works for BT3, but I just had to buy a separate network card.    Bottom line, it's sturdy, light-weight, very long battery life, and option for high gaming performance.  It can record Stereo Mix, has good BIOS options, and all the peripheral connections necessary.  I installed an 80GB Intel X-25 SSD. It was an extra $200, but it now boots into Windows in 30 seconds (instead of 1 min. 45 sec.) and is very quick and responsive. Now I have a spare 500GB hard drive.    So cruise for hot spots, surf the internet anywhere, do your homework anywhere, and play games anywhere. The battery will last you all day!    10/10 !",

But I really like their trackpad implementation - you can use your finger to scroll horizontally and vertically.<br /><br />Most important is the design of the keys.  They feel firm but not too hard.  They're quiet and well placed.  The number one advantage over the Microsoft keyboard is the double spacebar - one for each thumb.  The MS keyboard only has one space bar which you have to hit right in the middle otherwise it won't trigger.  That means you have to keep stretching your thumb towards the center of the keyboard to ensure you trigger the spacebar - not very ergonomic.  The two spacebars on the Adesso fit right under my thumbs and are very comfortable to use.<br /><br />Kudos to Adesso and shame on Microsoft.",

There are many other cases out there that cost much more and are simply not as nice.<br /><br />This keyboard case comes nicely packaged, with clear instructions.  I had this paired with my Ipad Air in under 30 seconds, no hassles or issues at all! I noticed other people said they had problems keeping it paired with their ipad... however, I did not have any issues with this at all... it stayed paired and never lost connection for me. The battery life is great... and it recharges fairly quickly.<br /><br />This folio keyboard really makes you feel like you have a mini-laptop! When my ipad air is installed in the case it does not feel like it adds bulk like some cases, its very slim and lightweight and the exterior has a very smooth finish.<br /><br />The keyboard keys are very responsive and have a nice feel to them and use the standard QWERTY layout. As with any keyboard of this size I tend to initially have trouble getting use to it being so small, so it takes some time for my hands to adjust to typing with a small keyboard, but this is to be expected on any case you use like this... its simply not going to be a full laptop or desktop keyboard size... but once I got use to it ... I was able to type with my normal accuracy. This keyboard has great shortcut keys like brightness and volume adjustments which is very convenient.<br /><br />The best part about this case is the way you can adjust your screen while its installed in this case... you can slide out the top section and tilt your ipad air screen at a great easily viewable angle and with the 360 degree turning feature your can easily and smoothly turn the ipad so its either horizontal or vertical depending on your preferences.<br /><br />A Few Minor Suggestions:<br /><br /> I wish the outside of the case had some texture so it was not so smooth (maybe a rubbered texture inlay?). I like the velvety feel of it but I would just like to feel I had a better grip when I pick it up, I just get worried because the ipad is an expensive devise and I do not want to drop it.\u2028<br /><br />I would like it if I could remove my Ipad Air more easily, I had a difficult time getting it out of the case when I just wanted to play a game... I got very nervous because I did not want to break my ipad. A good option would be if the ipad could detach from the keyboard so it was not necessary for me to try to remove the ipad from the case.\u2028<br />Lastly, I wish there was a thin layer of protection between the case and my ipad and a removable thin sheet of a soft microfiber to put between the keyboard and ipad glass when you close it.feel of it but I would just like to feel I had a better grip when I pick it up, I just get worried because the ipad is an expensive devise and I do not want to drop it.\u2028<br /><br />I would like it if I could remove my Ipad Air more easily, I had a difficult time getting it out of the case when I just wanted to play a game...

Be as thin and light as possible     Compared to the Targus 360 (which does not support sleep/wake), this case is thinner and lighter.  The ipad can be stood up at \\\\\"unlimited\\\\\" angles from ~55-75 deg (realistically) due to the big non-slip surface.      Compare that to the Targus which only has 2 notches.  However, I set the ipad at the lowest angle (~55 deg) most of the time.    I like the magnetic latch used to help keep the cover closed as opposed to the strap on the Targus because it's easier to use.    Now for the cons:  - I wish the angle would go lower to about 45 deg but b/c the viewing angle of the ipad is so good, this doesn't matter as much.  - There should be more coverage on all sides of the ipad. Right now, the ipad is held in place at 4 corners. The fit has been secure and stable so far though.  - There was a slight odor at first.  I'm airing it out and the odor seems to have mostly dissipated.  - At $60, it's $10 more than what I wanted to pay for a case in general.  - The word \\\\\"Joy\\\\\" on the latch makes the case look cheap.  The word shouldn't have been as prominent.    Overall though I do think it's the best case out there and strongly recommend it.",

I have been using Zagg products for years for my iPod and iPhone. So I decided to buy one for my MacBook Pro. I was a little reluctant at first because the application of the invisible shield takes a lot of time and patience. Applying the invisible shield gives you a really good grip on your laptop when you are carrying it. It's clear, and weightless.<br /><br />When I applied the invisible shield, I started with the sides first since they were little pieces and that gave me practice.<br /><br />---TIPS FOR APPLICATION---<br /><br />1) Get a slightly damp paper towel and clean you MacBook Pro first (make sure your hands are clean too!)<br /><br />2) Spray your fingers with the solution given and then peel off the invisible shield for the sides (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because the top and bottom pieces are way difficult, the sides will give you some practice)<br /><br />3) Spray the invisible shield after you've peeled it off the paper, apply to laptop have a damp paper towel and run it over the invisible shield after you applied it to the laptop so it can absorb and solution that might get into your laptop. Use the squeegee to remove any air bubbles. Repeat steps for other side.<br /><br />I applied the bottom of the shield after I did the sides and what you want to do is DO NOT PEEL THE WHOLE THING OFF THE PAPER. Peel off about 1/4 of the shield then spray the solution on it and apply it on the laptop. Straighten it if necessary.<br /><br />Slowly peel off the rest of the shield and spray the shield as you peel it from the paper. Once you apply the whole thing, use the squeegee if necessary to remove air bubbles.<br />After you are done, I highly recommend that you should leave the invisible shield on to dry overnight and DO NOT USE THE LAPTOP because it takes a while for it to stick to the surface. Using the laptop might shift the invisible shield while it is drying. Just repeat the same steps from the application of the bottom for the top part of your laptop.

Most subwoofers I hear are muddy.  With this system the bass is tight and rich.  The controller lets you set different EQ curves and set the overall volume of the subwoofer independently.  The system also comes with wedges for each of the satellite speakers so you can prop them up slightly so the speakers are pointed directly at you (if you are sitting at a desk). This is a really nice addition and does make a difference.  You can also use the wedges to point the monitors down at you if they are up on a bookshelf.  AI used these speakers for a small impromptu DJ gig at a convention in a large hotel suite packed with about 80 people.

Skinomi and TechArmor. Since I had no idea what I would like, I tried two different TechArmor protectors for my tablet (one HD clear and one with the matte anti-fingerprint, anti-glare), and bought a Skinomi TechSkin for my phone.<br /><br />Phone installation was first and was pretty straight forward. I was glad to have read some reviews, and knew in advance that immediately after installation the screen doesn't look that good. Since it's a wet application, it really does take a full 12 hours before it's all clear and smoothed out. But, the screen has a nice feel to it and the clarity and sharpness is excellent.<br /><br />Next was the installation of TechArmor (matte finish) protector on my Nexus 7 tablet. This protector is by far the best choice for being fingerprint resistant, but the clarity of text and images was diminished enough that I opted not to use it at all. The installation of the HD clear version of the TechArmor protector followed. Image and text clarity are perfect but it really provides no resistance to fingerprints at all. The feel of it was also a little too grippy for my preference.<br /><br />During the days of this experiment, I was using my phone with the Skinomi TechSkin, and liking it more everyday. The choice was really simple. Skinomi TechSkins somehow have found a way to provide perfect clarity for text and images while being VERY resistant to fingerprints. You will still wipe off your screen from time to time, but I'd say this protector reduces the problem with fingerprints by 70%. Naturally, I bought the same TechSkin for my Nexus 7 tablet.<br /><br />The wet application is a little more difficult in general and especially on a larger screen. I totally screwed it up and ruined my Skinomi TechSkin for the tablet. Knowing it was my own fault, I had little doubts that I would have to buy another if I wanted it. Nevertheless, I emailed Skinomi support about what happened. To my surprise (and delight), they only asked for a copy of my order, a picture of the ruined protector and the code that comes with the documentation in the box. With that, they actually sent me a free replacement! If that's not excellent customer service, I don't know what is....<br /><br />Before attempting the second installation of the same protector on my tablet, I watched the youtube video they tell you about in the instructions and noticed that I wasn't using nearly enough spray. This really solved all my problems. If you have enough spray on the protector, it's fairly easy to get it perfectly into place. Otherwise, it's nearly impossible. That's the only advice I'd give - watch the video and see how much they use and do the same. You'll have no issues.<br /><br />I now have Skinomi TechSkins on my phone and tablet and couldn't be happier. With the money I spent in this little experiment, take my advice and just by yourself the Skinomi. You'll be glad you did.",

I am extremely happy with this case.  The fit is perfect, the feel of the leather is very pleasing and the color is fantastic.  It is purple without being too PURPLE.  The case protects the entire iPad and the sleep/wake function works every time I open or close the case.  This case really personalized my iPad for me.  It's so different from the standard black cases.  It just makes me smile every time I see my iPad.  I would heartily recommend this case to anyone looking for a good quality product.",

Building this into the software would give users an entire new dimension of goodness.<br /><br />My mouse wheel stopped working properly after about a year of use, mousewheel-down would trigger multiple times when I scrolled in either direction.

So I started on a quest to find a battery replacement all over the internet - I literally tried as many as two (2) dozen batteries - all upwards of $30+ to only be disappointed with my choice as the computer was unable to recognize the battery, or identify it as counterfeit or fake - the battery indicator would flash orange/blue designating non-compliance to the computer, or, upon start-up the computer would identify the battery as not compliance and &#34;not chargeable&#34;. I read the reviews for this LB1 High Performance battery and thought I'd give it a try. I do have Windows 7 Ultimate loaded on my Vostro 1520 and am aware that there is a process by which you integrate the battery to the computer when replacing the current battery. I received this LB1 battery and thought I would just &#34;plug and play&#34; - the results? Instant integration without problems on my Vostro! Wow, great resuts, and, for the price, I could purchase as many as three (3) of these batteries for the price I paid for the other ones I tried...great replacement - have had for a few weeks now without any issue - thanks LB1!!!",

The sound is very warm and crystal clear, just what you'd expect  from a well known audio company.    You can get room filling sound and decent bass with a few tweaks.    I hooked them up to a Targus mini-usb 2.0 hub   (though i have 3 usb ports in the back of my pc)   and the notebook headphone jack.   Peeled apart the wire a few inches to reach both.      Right clicked on the speaker icon in the taskbar, selected  \\\\\"adjust audio properties\\\\\", added PC speaker to the usual array  of volume controls. Set all including pc speakers to max   except system volume which i set to 3/4    Then in audio properties under speaker settings, clicked on advanced  and chose desktop speakers from the dropdown menu instead of the default  laptop stereo.   (and though they get the sound from the headphone out jack, selecting  headphones is only for... well, headphones)    Running three sets of volume controls:  With the system volume at 3/4, the volume knob on the right speaker set  to half, your final volume will depend on the volume control of whatever  video or audio player you are using both on and offline.  You can play around with your volume settings to your own satisfaction.    Since system volume comes in loud, i don't bother to turn the speakers  on with the on-off switch on the back of the right speaker until i'm actually going to use them to listen to a film, video or mp3, etc or browse through these kinds of sites.  Till then, there is no sound since they are plugged into the headphone jack.    I haven't heard any start-up, shut-down or any other system sounds and have not missed them, there is almost always some visual effect associated  with those.    The sound at youtube and various video sites etc is not a substitute for expensive high end speakers but is very good for listening to music and movie soundtracks at decent volumes and good fidelity with none of the harsh muffled sound you usually get with outboard pc speakers.  And no distortion unless you run the sound up to absolute max.    You won't get deep bass, frequency is 180Hz-20KHz, but frankly i don't want deep bass rattling and thumping my notebook and its hard drive and optical drive with the speakers only 3 inches away.    As a bonus, the stereo separation is outstanding on these.    For the price i think these are the best notebook speakers around :)",

I solved this problem by dismounting the push-to-eject handle from the DVD unit and attaching it to the new caddy.

Best solution I've found is to buy parts and fix it yourself - or have that done by someone you trust who can reliably do the work.  Most of the problems I saw were from PEBKAC.",

This PSU has 1 x 24 pin, 1 x 4 pin, 2 x 4 pin Molex (on the same chain), and 2 x Sata (on the same chain). The problem with this setup is that there is not enough length between sata connectors as there are 2 connectors on one chain.

An awesome feature on this one is the ability to rotate it 90 degrees, but for some silly reason, you can't do so with the base this monitor comes with.  You will need to find some other way to mount this monitor in order to take advantage of this feature.<br /><br />There were several other things that were a little silly:<br />- The base feels a bit flimsy and took me a while to figure out how to assemble.  The diagrams were not particularly helpful, but after 15 or so minutes it finally came together.  (Go ahead and laugh.  I probably deserve it!)<br />- The buttons used to adjust the picture settings are conveniently located on the front of the monitor.  This is a pleasant change from Samsung's usual habit of placing them out of sight on the side of my other monitors.  However, the buttons take a significant amount of force to press, and the entire monitor moves when you do.  This makes for a very unsatisfying experience when adjusting brightness, etc.  I find myself using my other hand to steady the monitor when making adjustments.<br />- The power and video cables are on the short side (I'm guessing 6 feet).  I couldn't put the monitor where I wanted it and ended up having to rearrange my desk to make it work out of the box.<br /><br />All of that aside, I would recommend this monitor overall.

It is truly a snap to use as the top slips easily off and the drive easily connects or disconnects from the port inside the case.<br /><br />The case utilizes USB 3.0 speeds which give quite a boost over USB 2.0.  In a very unscientific test I loaded up a SSD in the case and copied over a large video file over both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports.  On the USB 3.0 ports I averaged about 105 MB/s and over the USB 2.0 ports I averaged about 37 MB/s.<br /><br />The USB cable provides the power for the drive so there is no need for an external power cable so that is nice.  If you're using some non-powered hubs I'm guessing the unit might not operate but it worked perfectly in both of my powered USB hubs.<br /><br />The case comes with a small USB 3.0 cable and has worked with other USB 3.0 cables I've tested.<br /><br />Overall this is a well built and easy to operate enclosure for any 2.5-inch drive.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.",

It has a strong Internet connection thanks to its dual antennas I assume. All I know is that there are certain spots in my house where my phone and laptop don't catch my wireless signal and the kindle does so that's a strong point for me. Good app selection and integration with amazon products and services. The screen is as bright and vivid as any tablet out there, it is solidly built and just the right size in my opinion. Speakers are above average and battery life is pretty decent as well. Here are some of the cons. First, no dual cameras and while it has the basic functionality of an iPad its just not arranged the same way, it's just not as intuitive or customizable as an iPad or other android tablet especially with regards to the home screen. The carousel is nice but I'm so used to my iPhone and iPad layout it just doesn't work for me although I'm sure there's an app for that. The ipad layout just makes everything faster and streamlined. It shouldnt take more than one step to get to the internet, or your favorite apps, etc. One really annoying thing is the ads on the startup screen. If you're gonna try and lower the price by forcing ads on us and not including a basic USB dc charger that literally costs you 39 cents then i think the price should be even lower than what it is.

For the most part, it duplicates what an iPhone or iPad can already do. The manufacturer seems to play up the capability of using it for two-camera shoots. Like I said, the market is pretty specialized.<br /><br />There are a few good semi-technical reviews on this so I won't just repeat them verbatim, but rather add a few observations of my own.<br /><br />It's nice that the hard case turns into a little monopod and that it can actually be used on a real standard tripod.  It's not nice that the camera swivels on a little magnet attached to the case ... but it's far to easy to bump it and knock the camera off. It doesn't appear to be capable of withstanding a few falls to a hard surface like pavement.<br /><br />The little light is nice but you better be very close to your subject, otherwise it's just not bright enough.  It's nice that it's wireless but I wouldn't think of it as a sport cam. And the camera itself is surprisingly heavy for what it is.<br /><br />There were a few reviews bemoaning the fact that the camera is useless with a PC or Android product. To be fair, that fact is stated clearly so if someone does not have a compatible product, they shouldn't buy this cam. That being said, I think Logitech is living in an unrealistic world by making this thing 100% incompatible with anything but Mac products ... virtually all hardware is multi-platform anymore and in the real world by far the highest percentage of people own multi-brands. I can see (for technical reasons) why functionality might be limited, but it makes no sense to not even be able to plug the USB into a PC and use it as a webcam. And WiFi is WiFi ... the signal should be receivable by ANY product that can pick up a WiFi signal. People want to carry smaller and LESS stuff with them, not larger and MORE stuff. The logic of making it 100% incompatible makes as much sense is not being able to use tires made for a Chevy on a Ford.being able to use tires made for a Chevy on a Ford.",

The case contains two primary pockets: the slimmer 'back' pocket is for the iPad itself, and the larger 'front' pocket contains banded knit netting to hold your iPad peripherals. The marketing materials promote that the larger of the netting pockets holds a portable keyboard and is configured to act as the actual workspace for the keyboard with attached iPad. The netted pockets are large and flexible enough to hold an iPad charger, cord as well as keys, work ID badge or any other commuting carry-arounds.    The bag is small which is both good and bad. It's light, fits comfortably over the shoulder with the extended shoulder strap, and has two smaller handles if the carrier prefers. The nylon case is strong and should protect all items during the course of normal wear, tear and banging around. The inside is also well-padded.    I commute about an hour to and from work each day. I'll easily be able to bring back and forth my iPad, a book, and additional basics. I'll need a larger bag when I need to schlep my laptop.

There no acknowledgement from support that this device has issues nor any attempt to fix them in a firmware update.  I even had a second one sent to me as a replacement unit but it behaved the same exact way.  Here's a list of the problems I've had over the past few years.

I also find their support staff either ignorant or robotic in their responses.  I try to explain a problem more and they paste the exact same response they have before as if they never even read what I wrote.  Support's official response for #5 is to turn off the sound... here's my response to that: If your car was making a weird grinding noise and you mechanic told you to wear ear plugs while you were driving what would you say?<br /><br />1 Causes BSODs my windows 8.1 PCs<br />2 PCs will not boot while connected<br />3 PCs will not shut down while connected<br />4 PCs can't enter BIOS while connected<br />5 USB-VNC Disconnect/Reconnect every 10 sec (makes USB connect noise which is REALLY annoying)<br />6 When it does boot\uff0c it takes ~3 minutes after boot is complete before I can use my Mouse/Keyboard to control the connected PC<br />7 I can't connect to get CubiQ.exe<br />8 CubiQ.exe does not work at all whatsoever!!!<br />9 Older PCs don't recognize keyboard in time to enter BIOS<br />10 Computer selection via GUI (I've never seen the GUI ever)<br />11 on-screen file transfer and copy-paste functionality (Never seen it)",

I find moving a mouse around a desk both clumsy and unnatural and just don't understand how people can accept them. This is my third trackball from Logitech and it is by far the best one I have had.(I gave the old ones to friends or family who are now converts to the trackball way!) It took a little while to get used to having the ball on the left side as opposed to the standard center position, but once I got used to using my thumb, things really flew. Set up was snap and the documentation was great. The design is very comfortable and the buttons and scroll wheel fall easily to hand. It has operated flawlessly for the year+ that I have owned it and I have only had to change the battery once in that time. The cordless feature works great and is a real boon to me because of my cluttered desk. Its RF signal does not interfere with my other IR controlled equipment(i.e. stereo and cordless keyboard). My only quibbles with this trackball (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that it needs a greater range and they need to use ball bearings in the ball seat like their other trackballs. Right now I have to have the reciever within a foot or so of the trackball to work consistantly and it would be much more convenient if I could stick it someplace out of the way. Using ball bearings instead of the current nylon mounts in the ball seat would give the ball the super smooth action that their other trackballs have had and that I'm used to. In the end, I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking to make their computing a more pleasurable experience, but be warned...trackballs can be addictive!",

I don't like replacing batteries and don't like the potential for interference.<br /><br />With that said, generally I've been quite surprisingly satisfied with the Logitech diNovo Keyboard for Notebooks.  First, I have to say I am a fan of the elegant and simple design.  It's relatively rectangular, but the edges are curved in a nice, subtle way.  The angle of the keyboard is nice, in my experience, and the black/brushed aluminum look is appealing to me.  I also don't like the touchpads that tend to get integrated into wireless keyboards--I prefer a full mouse (if a small one) to go on the side of my keyboard.<br /><br />More importantly than that, the keyboard's functionality is nice.  I like the responsiveness of the keys.  They are rounded in a way that feels good to the touch, and they have a good amount of springiness and resistance to the keystroke.  I've had little input lag or error, except when typing from an excessively far distance--most normal constraints would be fine for this device.<br /><br />I can't say I use this keyboard everyday, but I do wish battery life was a bit better.  I couldn't give a great estimate, but part of the reason I find myself wanting more is because even after periods of little to no use, sometimes I find the batteries die quickly.  However this could also be attributed to using my rechargeable batteries, which may not exactly be new.<br /><br />Finally, one nice touch, for me, is the inclusion of the side numpad.  It's not something I absolutely need, but I enjoy having it.  Using a laptop, the numpad gives additional options.  Using a desktop, it replicates functionality better as a result of the numpad.  I don't make a habit of using the media/app keys, but they function as advertised and I haven't had any trouble with them.<br /><br />With all that said, if the only issue is replacing some rechargeable AAA batteries now and then, it's a pretty solid device, in my opinion.  The battery issue isn't a huge one--I still get plenty of life out of it.  I just always find myself wishing for a LITTLE BIT more.  I can't say what consistent use as a primary keyboard would do to the battery life, but I expect it would be sufficient enough.<br /><br />Overall, a really great wireless device.  I'm very happy with my purchase, even long after the initial purchase.  I haven't found any other keyboards that match simplicity, style, and functionality with the diNovo for Notebooks.plenty of life out of it.  I just always find myself wishing for a LITTLE BIT more.

The case is strong and the keyboard feels like a regular laptop keyboard. My favorite feature is the ability to detach the entire iPad from the keyboard. This allows the user to use the iPad on its own, and allows for much more freedom. The case allows for many different angles, either in landscape or portrait mode. Further, the case &#34;locks into&#34; portrait or landscape method so it does not swivel back and forth.

That being said, HooToo customer service was more than adequate and I appreciate solid customer service very much.<br />End of update<br /><br />First off, I'm no tech at network setup.  I have performed the task lots of times, successfully, and I am aware of what a WAN port is vs. a LAN port.  However, and this may be where my lack of knowledge is a problem, I truly don't understand how you can advertise as having LAN features without a single LAN port.  In my hope that \\\\\"Lan features\\\\\" meant LAN features, I assumed that, like other routers I have had, the one Ethernet port could serve as a WAN or a LAN depending on one's need.  I have searched amazon reviews through and through, searched the rest of the Web and even re-read the very limited \\\\\"pamphlet\\\\\" or \\\\\"sad excuse for a manual\\\\\" more times than I care to admit.  Still, no dice.  I am returning this immediately for a wifi router that actually has LAN features.<br /><br />I should add, that if I am incorrect in believing the one WAN port cannot be turned into a LAN port, then HooToo has made zero effort to explain how that is done.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering what I was going to use this for, I own a Behringer X32 Digital Mixer that has the option to connect a wireless router (one with actual LAN features btw) directly to the mixer via cat5 to then be controlled wirelessly by an iPad or iPhone.  If you have any sort of similar need, this supposed \\\\\"LAN featured wifi router\\\\\" is lacking a very crucial component.....a flipping LAN port!",

I wanted to buy a ballistic glass protector, but unfortunately wasn't able to find one for the HDX.  After reading all the positive reviews, and the&#34;self healing&#34; ability, I decided to give this product a shot.  I figured for the price it was worth taking a chance.  Overall, I think this is a very nice product.<br /><br />My ArmorSuit MilitaryShield arrived before my Kindle, so I was able to check it out before I committed.  It was well packaged...no chance of receiving it damaged;  thank you very much for that since that is not always the case with orders purchased from Amazon.<br /><br />ArmorSuit MilitaryShield was rolled onto a self adhesive backing.  It came with a cleaning cloth, a plastic squeegee,  cleaning/application solution, and most importantly instructions.  The instructions were printed on a large paper.  The instructions were well written and easy to understand.  For the mechanically or technically challenged, the instructions even direct you to their YouTube page to show you a detailed installation of this shield.<br /><br />When my Kindle came in, I immediately installed the shield.  Here is my experience:<br /><br />The most important part of this installation is to clean your hands and your Kindle.  You cannot get good results without doing this.  It's that simple.  Having prior experience installing window tint professionally made this installation familiar.<br /><br />After cleaning my hands and the Kindle, I liberally sprayed my hands and protector with the solution.  Once both are wet, I began installing the film from left to right, squeegeeing as I went.  It's important that you keep the film close to the glass as possible when installing and squeegee when you apply to glass.<br /><br />Once that's done, you may or may not have bubbles.  If you do, then saturate thefilm with spray and squeegee outwards.  As you get to the edges, use the included cleaning cloth to absorb the liquid from under the film.  Do this until all bubbles are removed.  It's extremely important that you keep the film wet during this process, or you chance scratching film.  If you find any creases on your film, remove film and start again making sure you keep the film wet.<br /><br />Once you are done getting the bubbles out place your Kindle on a flat surface for up to 48 hours to dry.  During this drying period, the imperfections will go away.  Here is where I made a mistake.  After a few hours I took a look at it, and it looked like crap!  So I removed the film and reinstalled.  If you do this, you will most likely run out of solution.  If you do, you can use a high quality cleaner you would use to clean your glasses.  I reinstalled the film and it went on good again.  I checked on it a few hours later, and it still looked terrible!  It looked as if there was dust or dirt under the film.  This time, I let it sit for the recommended 48 hours and wow!  The imperfections completely disappeared!<br /><br />The glass looks really good.  I'm not sure if I lost any resolution with this film, but it looks fine to me.  My brother was over on Christmas and was playing with my Kindle and didn't even notice there was any film on the screen, which is great since he hates these protectors.<br /><br />I do agree that it is difficult to tell that there is film on my Kindle.  But if you start looking at the screen at different angles, you can see the imperfections in the film itself, not the installation. These imperfections resemble scratches, but they aren't.  Because of this, I question if this actually &#34;self heals&#34; like advertised.  As for fingerprints, it doesn't appear to really make a difference.  But that's fine by me, since that is not why I bought this.<br /><br />I am on the fence regarding the feel of the film.  It me feels weird to me.  It's probably just me regarding the feel.  Regarding screen sensitivity, I do no notice any loss due to using this protector.<br /><br />Unless I see a high quality ballistic glass for an affordable price, I would certainly use this again.  The price is very fair for what they are providing.  They were a pleasure doing business with.  And they followed up to make certain I was happy with my purchase.",

I definitely love the weight reduction- a very big difference that you feel as you compare both in your hands.

I never heard from him again, although he did email me a survey after not solving my issue to ask me how he did?!  I tried calling again later on and the next person sent me a new Kindle in the mail and I returned the old one.  It took me an entire evening of messing around with the new one to get it to set up.  This included it freezing repeatedly, not recognizing any wifi networks and then randomly all of a sudden recognizing them but not accepting my password but then after 20 minutes on the phone with technical support it suddenly decided to accept my password followed by freezing and having to restart it.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great ereader if you can actually get it to work.

Our largest devices are a 48-port D-Link switch and a 48-port Netgear switch, which fit with the rack adjusted to its maximum depth.<br /><br />I was impressed with the quality. It's a very sturdy, solid rack (and heavy); even though it's adjustable, which had me a little doubtful when I ordered. But after 6 months, with plenty of wire manipulation, it shows no signs of weakness, and stands there like a rock.<br /><br />This model (RK812WALLOA) has an adjustable depth (RK812WALLO is the non-adjustable version). The adjustment isn't simple, though -- it's meant to be done one time at installation, requiring complete removal of 8 bolts. The rack is still completely sturdy even when fully extended.<br /><br />Installation is fairly painless, but a bit more time-consuming than I anticipated. You'll want a second person to help. The thing is heavy, and chances are you'll need to mark/drill holes; even once that's done, you'll want to have one person hold it up while the other screws it in.<br /><br />- Beware this doesn't come with hardware to mount it to the wall. I used drywall screws with plastic anchors, and that seems to have worked out well.<br /><br />- This also doesn't come with enough nuts if, for example, you're planning to fill up the rack with 1U devices. It actually only comes with enough nuts to mount 2 or 3 devices (I was disappointed to find this out, as the specs don't mention the number of included nuts).

I tried all the methods they say for fixing it and nothing worked.<br /><br />So now im left with no laptop for 3 weeks ( While im in college ) and have to pay the shipping to get it fixed. Thats honestly sad you pay that much for something that crashes a week after you buy it.<br /><br />Like I said though, when it was working.

            "input": "The LAP PRO universal tablet stand doesn't work very well with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\\\\" Wi-Fi tablet.  The stand consists of a very firm, 18-inch wide, cylindrical pillow with a soft handle that doubles as a sort of tray for the tablet.  Because there is no frame to hold the tablet securely, the tablet must be set carefully into the handle-tray, and then the tablet simply leans against the pillow for support.  However, the tablet is very easily dislodged from the tray, even when the stand is sitting on a flat tabletop.<br /><br />Out of the box, the LAP PRO holds the 8.9\\\\\" Kindle Fire HD tablet at a near-vertical angle that is uncomfortable for viewing or for using a stylus on the touch screen.  There is a sheet packed with the pillow that says: \\\\\"Your LAP PRO has come slightly over filled intentionally, which may interfere with some functions.  This will change in time.  This is to ensure it will perform properly and last longer after it breaks in.  The fabric will stretch and the beans settle from use.\\\\\"  However, this is not really a beanbag stand.  The pillow is filled with something that feels like medium-fine sand (not beans).  Also, the pillow is too firm to accommodate its shape to an uneven surface the way a beanbag does.<br /><br />To adjust the tablet viewing angle, you must reshape the pillow--it isn't enough to simply roll the pillow forward or backwards.  Because the pillow is so firm, you must exert some effort in reshaping.  It is easier to adjust the pillow shape and the viewing angle if you unzip the zipper that runs alongside the handle-tray, but then the pillow kind of flops around.  (The zipper is there to open and close a compartment that is probably intended to hold your tablet, because the LAP PRO is also supposed to be a \\\\\"caddy\\\\\".)<br /><br />If I needed a travel pillow (another of the LAP PRO's advertised uses) or a tablet caddy, I might end up liking the LAP PRO.  However, because the stand is too large for convenient tabletop use, is hard to adjust, doesn't hold the tablet securely, and needs break-in time, I rate it at 2 stars (\\\\\"I don't like it\\\\\" on the official Amazon scale).<br /><br />EDITED 11/18/12:  After hearing from the seller, Renegade Concepts, I believe that I may have received an overfilled LAP PRO.  (Renegade Concepts offered to replace my unit.) If my LAP PRO had been less firm out of the box, I would have rated it at 3 stars (\\\\\"It's OK\\\\\").just, doesn't hold the tablet securely, and needs break-in time, I rate it at 2 stars (\\\\\"I don't like it\\\\\" on the official Amazon scale).<br /><br />EDITED 11/18/12:  After hearing from the seller, Renegade Concepts, I believe that I may have received an overfilled LAP PRO.

I had to swivel the light at least twice for each page. I was concerned with other comments that this also didn't light the sceen evenly, but ordered anyway. I am glad that I did.

I update my laptop every 1 year and half or so, by that i mean i sell my current laptop and buy the lastest i can affort. I can tell the other 2 laptops from asus i sold still working perfectly not a single issue. Some people may think im an ASUS fanboy but i do some research before buying if i can find a laptop with better hardware for a lower price i might go with another brand. For example i see a lenovo with the same specs for about $1000, i bought this one for $1200 mainly because i know its a trusted brand and the cooling system is very good and very very silent.<br /><br />With this babe you can play the most recent games at decent settings here some examples of some games i tested:<br /><br />No Vsyng or AA in any of the games above.<br /><br />Dota 2 1080p max settings = 40-65 fps<br />Medal of honor Warfighter 1080p max settings = 27-33 fps<br />MaxPayne 3 1080p max settings = 35-40 fps<br />Far Cry 3 1080p custom settings everything on max except shadows on medium and posfxquality off = 26-34 fps<br /><br />As long as i get 28 fps+ im happy.<br />For the record i have my gtx 660m OC @ +100, +300. Max temp i've ever reach 81\u00b0.<br /><br />In my case i dont like 17\\\\\" laptops and my budged was $1200. So this laptop suite my needs. If you want a high end laptop, dont mind the size and have the money, go with alienware or clevo.

I needed something to hold my tablet for me!<br /><br />The TABRM086 couldn't be any more perfect as a tablet holder for my particular situation. Setup only took a few minutes. The only hitch was that I had to adjust the width of the c-clamp. If your mounting area isn't particularly thick, make sure to have a Phillips screwdriver ready, like I did! As for putting everything together, it really couldn't have been much easier: Choose the right size arms on the spring-loaded tablet holder [4 short ones, if you're using a Surface RT, like me], clamp the mount, adjust the arm, attach the holder, insert tablet. The arm is EXACTLY the right length for where I put it. I had concerns that the clamp might slide down while I was recording, but it's been holding strong for a few sessions now and hasn't budged a bit! Now doing silly voices is a much more comfortable experience!<br /><br />So, in summary: If you're in need of a tablet c-clamp style mount, this is a great choice!",

            "input": "First off, I can't say anything about the ability of this device to protect against surges b/c I haven't done any tests on it. However, if you believe the specs (and it seems like the Tripp Lite ones are more honest and thorough than most other brands), it provides a good deal of protection for a surge protector/suppressor in this price range.<br /><br />I chose this particular model because of the many positive reviews on other models. My first and only experience with Tripp Lite was back in 2000. The surge protector worked well and provided a good user experience in that it's fairly easy to push the plugs in and pull them out and has 3 useful indicator lights. Also, the plastic has a good feel to it. I'm still using it today. I'm glad to see the reviews for Tripp Lite's other products are generally good. Also, if you spend as much time as I did, the positive reviews seem to be based more off of substance/experience than just subjective guesses.<br /><br />Well, my next step was to look up the specs. The Tripp Lite website was very thorough. At one point, I was down to three Belkin surge protectors and 3 Tripp Lite ones. The Tripp LIte website had all the technical info I was looking for while the Belkin website was lacking in specification details. Go read up on what's important when looking to buy a surge protector (e.g., energy absorption; clamping voltage; response time, etc.) and you'll care more about the specs. Amazon's product descriptions lack these details and that's okay, but it's not okay for the mfr's website to lack this detail. So, I decided to go with the Tripp LIte products. Oh, Tripp Lite keeps advertising the # of transformers. It does matter b/c in some other brands/models, some plugs are disabled and will not allow for use of all the plugs. Read some of the bad reviews on the other products if you don't believe me.<br /><br />Now it's time to choose the model I want. Originally, I was going to go with the Tripp Lite TLP810SAT's sister product that comes with an ethernet line connector instead of the coaxial connector. However, once I figured out that I'll never use ethernet surge suppression b/c this is for residential use and that I have FiOS, which uses a coaxial cable connection, I decided to go with this model. Also, don't be misled that all coaxial cable connections are the same. Only one set of coaxial cable connections on this surge protector is specifically designed for high bandwidth broadband use (see the Tripp Lite website and compare the specs for different models). If I only had cable internet, I wouldn't have cared so much, but because I have a FiOS connection, I decided not to take the chance. Also, for a few dollars more than the other version, I don't see any reason to pass up on this model. Finally, if I did end up having FiOS and some other connection that requires a coaxial cable, I'm all set. So, I rather pay a little more for this model than the other model that has an ethernet connection that I'll never use.<br /><br />Now for the negative. The packaging had a little wrinkling in it, while the box it shipped in was okay. Also, there's no way to tell if this thing is new or used b/c the packaging is not sealed. One or two of the plug covers were in the open position as well. It's annoying that I don't know for sure if I received a brand new product, but it does have a lifetime warranty, so it's not really a big concern. Overall, I'm fine with this product.<br /><br />UPDATE JAN 2012: I'm not sure when the change happened, but Tripp Lite's website now says that both sets of coaxial plugs are now \\\\\"2 Sets 2.2GHz gold coax jacks\\\\\" and \\\\\"2 line (2.2 GHz Bandwidth)\\\\\". It's implied in the Amazon manufacturer description as well. Looks like they either upgraded the other set of coax jacks or found out that it is good enough to meet the 2.2 GHz bandwidth advertisement. Note that in the version I bought, one set of coaxial plugs is labeled \\\\\"DSS Protection\\\\\" while the other set is \\\\\"Cable/Antenna Protection\\\\\". Note that I bought my first one of these in mid-2009 and a second one in April 2010. Both are still working well and so is the other Tripp Lite model I bought in 2000.e in mid-2009 and a second one in April 2010. Both are still working well and so is the other Tripp Lite model I bought in 2000.",

I'm extremely happy with this purchase for a few reasons:<br /><br />Installation was easy.<br />It bolts in like any other harddrive. My biggest problem was that the two harddrive bays in my laptop were unlabeled and I had to take a gamble on which one actually contained my install of windows. That's not Intel's fault, but it was the biggest problem with installing this drive. It came with a molex to sata power converter, a sata cable, a 2.5 to 3.5 converter tray, and all the screws I might have needed in desktop or laptop.<br /><br />Migration was easy.<br />The Intel migration tools are nice and simple. All I had to do was install the tool and tell it to migrate. It even automagically found my new SSD as the destination and my windows install as the source. It restarted the computer into the transfer utility and did it all the appropriate moving and resizing to put my 500gb Windows 7 installation on the 180gb SSD. After that I had to change the boot priority of the drives to make my laptop boot to the SSD instead of my old mechanical one.<br /><br />The drive is crazy fast.<br />The speed of this drive is just silly. My computer boots and finishes loading all programs so fast that everything is loaded before my wifi adapter can connect to my network. This means I have the first world problem that Steam completely loads before there is internet connectivity and complains that it is offline. Copying files from one location to another on the drive happens at speeds so fast I don't feel the need to benchmark it. Booting up my laptop takes about 15 seconds because of my bios wait time and shutting down takes about two seconds.<br /><br />Head parking sounds traded for an odd sound after standby.<br />I have noticed that my laptop makes a high pitched sound when coming out of standby. It lasts about three seconds and goes away. I think there's something that thesoundcard might be picking up from the drive. It's not too bad and only happens right after standby so I'm O.K. with it. I'm happy to trade the frequent sound of the mechanical drives parking their heads for a short sound that only happens after standby.<br /><br />As an overall review I will say that Intel SSD drives will probably go into any new machine I build and recommendations I make to other people regarding builds.",

If that is what you want you would probably be better off getting a barebones box for about $100 and building it up. Also, the DVD player wouldn't read discs so they sent us a replacment-a full size DVD-RW that won't fit into this computer at all since it uses mostly laptop components. They never responded to our request to send us the right part but the DVD finally started working, possibly due to the fact that the cable finally snapped in the way it was supposed to after removing it again to inform them what part we really needed. IDE cables for laptops can be problematic and the company probably should have had us try unhooking all the cables and reconnecting them before they sent a replacement drive for a different kind of computer.",

None that can't be overcome, of course.<br />#1 - Setup<br />The physical installation is a snap.  Plug in the cables and you're done.  Installing and configuring with the USB configuration program was easy.  But then you have to switch to the SNMP configuration tool if you want to use any of the more useful features like MAC authentication.  Only problem: you need to assign it an IP address, which is hard for those of us that use public IP addresses, since you either waste a public IP or set up a private IP on a different mask and alias the configuring computer's interface to communicate with the private netmask.  It's manageable for someone that does networking for a living, but certainly not for a typical consumer.<br />#2 - Signal Strength and Latency<br />I don't think this is as strong as most AP's.  I can AdHoc between two cards across my apartment complex, but I only get very weak intermittent signals using the AP from the same location.  While playing games such as WarCraft 3 over the WLAN, I often times get timeouts and lag, for something that only averages 20ms in ping times even if the cards are in good range with 80-90% signal.<br />#3 - SNMP<br />For a product that claims to be SNMP manageable, it certainly isn't SNMP compliant.  It uses its own proprietary SNMP OID's and can't be used with typical management programs.  On the good side, there's a Perl filter online for those interested in running MRTG for bandwidth usage graphs over this AP.  VERY useful.<br />Overall, I would recommend this AP as it is very cheap and still useful for all my needs.",

            "input": "I bought this as an inexpensive NAS option for backups for my parents' desktop and notebooks last Christmas and have had a frustrating experience trying to support it ever since, only recently discovering that the lack of NTFS support was the root of the problem.    The drive can be formatted with NTFS and used solely over the USB link, but network connectivity requires that the drive be formatted FAT32.  For those not technically inclined, FAT32 was introduced with Windows 98 and, although XP supports the filesystem, NTFS was brought to the home user with Windows XP Home Edition way back in 2001.  The main limitations of FAT32 compared to NTFS are the lack of security (FAT32 keeps no record of who or what owns a particular file), and it is incapable of handling individual files larger than 4 GiB, which normally wouldn't be a problem unless you were handling DVD images or, say, computer backups.    The last firmware released by Iomega for the drive introduces a non-standard kludge for manipulating files larger than 4 GiB over the network:  files are broken up on the actual drive, as visible through USB, but they are presented as single files over the LAN.  However, non-standard means exactly that, and there is no reason for any standards-compliant application (such as most backup software) to expect to be able to write anything larger than 4 GiB to the drive when it sees it is formatted with FAT32.      The upshot?  I tried Windows Live OneCare, which seems to work fine until the backup pool for a particular computer reaches the 4 GiB limit, at which point OneCare will be \\\\\"unable to detect\\\\\" the drive until you erase the existing backups and start over.  NTBACKUP (installable from the Windows XP Home Edition CD and included in the installation of Windows XP Professional) will back up directly to the drive until the result runs up against the 4 GiB barrier and start giving you write errors.  And most damningly, the drive cannot be used as backup media for Windows Vista's Backup and Restore at all:  without an NTFS drive, that program will generate errors attempting to ask for the password to an NTFS account that does not exist.      The one program I have not yet tried is the software included with this drive, but I haven't for a very good reason:  only one license is included.  Why one would want a hard drive with an ethernet port when one only needs to backup a single machine is beyond me.  And even if I did only need one computer backed up, I would use the USB port instead, formatting the drive with NTFS.    To sum up, NTFS can only be accessed via USB, the maximum filesize cludge in the latest firmware all but eliminates the use of the USB port when the drive is FAT32, and the included software is meaningless in a networked environment.  And I know of no technical reason why Iomega hasn't implemented NTFS through a firmware patch; the platter itself doesn't care and the Linux-based firmware should be more than capable.  The lack of standards compliance and plain-old common sense on Iomega's part here has turned me off of their company for the foreseeable future.      Personally, the real kicker is that I previously purchased a Western Digital MyBookWorld for my own needs, and wanted to avoid the bundled Mionet software, the unexplained calls back to their servers even when Mionet isn't used, and the collection of .TMP files that keep showing up in the root directory, when I shopped for a similar product for my parents.  WD may not do FTP, but at least it does NTFS.",
