            "input": "I am a Google employee and had to chance to use the device for a few months now. This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn\u2019t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven\u2019t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don\u2019t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn\u2019t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don\u2019t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that.  5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

Hardware wise this is essentially a slower version of the [[ASIN:B004BDOR74 GTX 580]] with less CUDA cores and 4 times the memory.     I docked 1 star from my rating because of the price.

The USB adapter that comes with it is for apple products i believe.  The thicker connector, not the standard android blackberry one that is slender, but you can buy the adapter for 1-2 bucks on amazon if you look hard enough.<br /><br />You're not gonna write novels probably, but its a protective case and can minimize screen fingerprints.  I like using a keyboard even though ive gotten fast at typing one letter at a time like everyone else with touch screens.  I can type 70-80 wpm from a regular keyboard and i believe i could probably do 1/2 that on this little guy with a few more errors.<br />With that said, i like being able to push a button to get out of a screen, if its not obvious, like on a computer.  Also, i like being able to press enter to submit and tab through filling out forms.  If you use computer messaging services, this would work good for that.<br /><br />If you've had these devices long enough you realize it can get frustrating to tap on a box to enter data as it can prompt you to a zoom function.  Not a big deal and we've all gotten use to it, but hey for 20 bucks for something to make it easier? Count me in.

This cover came very quickly and is excellent in all respects.  I was very pleasantly surprised how supple the leather is (but the case itself is more rigid and protective).  Fits perfectly.  Soft interior to protect the Nexus.  I definitely like the auto-on/auto-off function.  Only time will tell how user-friendly and durable it continues to be.  Not sure what the warranty is -- hope I don't have to care.  Appears well worth the slightly higher price.<br /><br />UPDATE #1:<br />After using the case for roughly a week, I've found it's still generally a very good product, but it also has an annoyance that I'm having trouble getting used to.  To retain the tablet securely, the cover wraps around the front of the Nexus slightly, and in doing so covers a small part of the screen edge.  That, plus the thickness of the material covering the edge makes it difficult to sweep your finger all the way to the edge (as in moving apps from one home screen to another).  This is sufficiently troublesome to me that I've downgraded my rating from 5 to 4, and have just ordered an \\\\\"official\\\\\" case (since it's finally available) from Google Play.  That cover appears to be less intrusive.  But after checking with Google, that case apparently doesn't include the magnetic on/off functionality that I like very much.  We'll see how it works out after some use.  Maybe someone will eventually make a cover that incorporates all these features.  This is why I'm not usually first in line for a new product.  Still learning, but very impressed with the Nexus itself.<br /><br />UPDATE #2<br />Truly exceptional customer CARE -- not just service. Florence from PC Micro Store called me in response to my comment, to make sure I was using the case as intended. I am. It seems a stylus is about the only solution for me to be able to consistently and easily access the full screen (to the edge to move apps). While that's less than a perfect solution I'm going to be shopping more at PMS because they are the kind of organization I like to deal with. And don't be too surprised if there's a second generation case that comes along relatively soon that gives full face access. By the way, the warranty on the case is full lifetime.",

If you're like our family, you have more than 2 PCs (we have 6 PCs, 1 media center, 2 XBOXs, and 2 MP3 players) and your music, photos, and multi-media are spread throughout the network.  You also have never done a single backup of any of the PCs in your house and you're one hard-drive failure from losing those precious moments.    The HP MediaSmart Home Server, based on Microsoft's Home Server Edition is not your plain-vanilla backup drive.  Instead it has some killer features:    -  Speedy, intuitive setup in a great looking machine (took me literally 10 minutes to setup)  -  Automatic backup with optional folder duplication  -  Hot-pluggable storage allows you to expand storage up to 16 terabytes on the fly (we have 1 terabyte)  -  Login remotely and upload/download files from anywhere  -  Access other computers on your network remotely (like Go-to-My-PC)  -  File/media serving and print serving (centralize your media and access it from any device)  - Setup a domain in a few clicks so you can share your folders with friends and family over the web  - Monitor all your PCs for security...you will get alerts if antivirus or the firewall aren't working  - Extensible \\\\\"Add-ins\\\\\" allow developers to build and offer (usually freeware) some cool features like remote management, mobile access, and dozens of other custom applications  - You can also sign-up for internet storage and backup your Home Server automatically (for additional safety) to offsite providers for as little as $5/month for unlimited storage    Overall, I consider the Home Server to be a breakthrough in home technology.  There's no other backup drive or NAS on the market that offers the breadth of features or extensibility, in a centralized and automated fashion (for those lazy home administrators).  I am really happy with this purchase and particularly happy that all of our family pictures are finally safe from hard-drive failure.  I heartily recommend the MediaSmart Home Server.",

Note there are no cutouts for the dock openings, so you will NOT be able to dock the tablet without removing it from the case.  All the other cutouts are fine.

Some people report problems, others say it installed in a snap.  <br /> <br />Well, it installed in a snap on my machine and my mother's.  We are both running Windows XP sp2.  Before installing, I made sure to do Windows update, and installed all non-critical updates and driver updates, as well as the critical updates. I'm wondering if people who are experiencing problems are running older versions of MS Windows, or if they haven't done the latest updates from Microsoft. <br /> <br />My mother lives 2000 miles away, and is technically challenged.  We used XP's Remote Assistance feature so that I could remotely go into her machine and do all the updates.  I downloaded the latest Logitech software for the camera from their site, and also loaded that on my mother's machine.  After the reboot, mom was on her own to plug in the camera and follow the screen directions.  Okay, I was actually on the phone with her while she did it, but it went okay with no problems. <br /> <br />I'm having a little problem with my HP All In One scanner/copier/printer since installing the Logitech camera and MSN Messenger 6.2 -- sometimes my computer would freeze when I try to print.  I don't know which is causing the conflict (camera software or MSN Messenger) and have temporarily stopped using that printer until I have time to look into it.  My other HP printer, a LaserJet, is working perfectly.  Mom has an HP photo printer and hers is working perfectly as well. <br /> <br />The microphone is very sensitive, so we have to use headphones when we have an audio conversation or else there is feedback.  Moving the speakers to point away from the microphone did not help.  The microphone is great, though.  I had an audio conversation with a friend using another brand of microphone, and the first syllable of almost every sentence he said was lost.  Not so with the microphone in this camera.  The sound is really good. <br /> <br />Mom and I chat on Messenger almost every day, and we use the web camera about once a week.  For the past 40 years, she and I have always lived less than 20 miles apart.  This web camera is making a big difference in helping us make the adjustment to being so far apart.  I highly recommend it.  Phone calls are great, but nothing can replace seeing the smile and laughter of a loved one in real time.",

I did search for a while before settling on the Poseidon, but after ~2 months of use I started getting pretty extreme ghosting and the spacebar would hang and repeat at least twice for each press. The BlackWidow does not suffer from any of those annoyances and has been a remarkable keyboard so far. The only complaint that I have for this keyboard is the built-in headphone support, which I don't really need, but it makes my turtle beach headset sound tinny and produces an audible background noise for others when talking on TS or Skype. Moving my headset to the case or on-board connectors resolves the issue. I may be unique in my experience with the keyboard headset input, but if I needed the inputs it might be a deal breaker.

The problem is that when you use the flap to prop the device up to watch a movie, the flap is not really strong enough to support the weight of the device in a stable position. As others noted this is especially a problem on counters or wood tables. I had this happen numerous times over the past year causing my kindle to fall flat onto the table, an annoyance but nothing terrible...until today.

Now this part was easier than getting rental modem from comcast itself. All I have to do was enter account number and phone number on activation screen, click next ---> next ...Comcast detected mac address and found the account and went ahead with activation and within couple minutes this modem got activated. Voila!! how easy can comcast make it. Did quick speed test and 27MBps Download, over 5Mbps upload speed, can't beat that.<br /><br />Feed back from other reviews: Some user complained issues with comcast well I must say that is not true. First try first time flawless activation of used modem without having to call comcast customer service.<br /><br />I highly recommend this modem if you are switching to comcast and always have your own wifi router seperate from modem, previously I had used rental modems from comcast and those worked but not as flawless as Arris WBM760A.",

I also love that the stand works well on the arm of a couch and other areas. When you carry it, you can have a couple of fingers in the circle around the Apple logo for extra carrying support.<br /><br />What I dislike is that the magnetic part of the cover is hit and miss, and just walking around with it can turn the screen on and off again frequently. This causes unexpected battery drain, so if you are walking any significant length with it you definitely want to use the elastic to keep it shut. Even then, since the magnet is hit and miss you still can have the on/off thing happen. The case is also fairly bulky. Lastly, to just open the case and hold the iPad to read is awkward because you end up with a long flap of case to deal with. You can fold it under, which just adds to the bulkiness. You can let it stretch out behind, which then becomes difficult to manage.",

The double click works sometimes, which isn't a big deal for me. Buttons have a good sound to them, if a bit loud. Now to the weird stuff: the DPI button. When you press it, it flashes a blue light a certain number of times at a certain speed, which is just weird. Mouse performs well at the highest DPI. The box says you can increase the polling rate by pressing the left, right, and \\\\\"rolling\\\\\" buttons at the same time for 5 seconds. I assumed that the rolling button is the scroll wheel and tried it. There was no indication of it working or not. The mouse is right-handed, so don't buy it if you're a lefty. I like to hold mice with my thumb a bit further forward than most people, but the mouse doesn't really accommodate that very well, as the thumb \\\\\"well\\\\\" ends a little less than an inch from the front.

My last card scored a 7.6 on the Windows Experience rating which was the highest rating Windows gave at the time.  This less expensive card only dropped it to 7.3.  I tend to go over-kill on my computer parts and rarely play graphic intensive games and rarely do a bit of video editing so I'm sure this card will be more than enough for me (just hope it lasts longer than my last one).  The HDMI out appears to be full size rather than a mini needing an adapter, I'm sure this will be appreciated when it is time to replace my monitor (and possibly switch it out with a television).  I have only had this card a few days but other than a couple of install issues have had no problems so far.<br />As far as the install issues there are a couple of things to know.  I run Windows 8-64 bit and when I first installed this card I thought it was defective.  I had a lot of flickering areas on my screen and Windows Explorer would crash every time I tried to open it.  I was able to open Google Chrome and visit Asus' site to download the latest Windows 8-64 bit driver and everything worked fine (I suspect the install disk installed either an outdated driver or one meant for 32 bit).  After installing the new driver and everything working fine I installed a Windows recommended update and started getting the same issues I had before installing the Asus driver.  I re-installed the Asus driver, didn't check Windows for any recommended updates and everything has been working great ever since.  If possible I would recommend downloading the driver before installing the card so that you have the driver to install after you physically install the card.  Otherwise Explorer may keep crashing on you and you won't be able to download the driver or download another browser that can be used to get to the driver download.<br />One thing to know when visiting Asus' website for updates...it is a bit quirky.  At the time of this writing you will have an option to manually search for your video card, have a program automatically scan for your card, or use a part # to find downloads for your card.  When I tried the automatic scan I had no luck.  When I tried to find it manually I found what I thought to be the correct card and downloaded a BIOS update I was told the update didn't match the BIOS series on the card.  When I entered the part # (found on a sticker on the box) and did the driver download everything went fine.  This card seems to be great for the money but if you plan on playing a lot of graphic intensive games or doing a lot of video editing and nothing but the best will do you may want to consider increasing your budget.",

It sounds loud, clear, and the surround sound is spot on.<br />The cord is long, very long, when you have to charge it up, so there's no worries about being stuck when the battery is drained. It recharges fast, within a few minutes it's back to fully charged and lasts 10+ hours.<br />It even turns itself off if there is no sound being played through the headset to conserve power.<br /><br />The mic, from what I am told, is very clear. It picks up all voices and cancels out background noise (such as my fan or doors closing) so well that no one can hear excess noise. You can be a foot away or so from the mic and it'll still pick your voice up and not background noise.<br /><br />I'm singing praises for this headset because I feel it is a perfect purchase for someone looking into gaming that may or may not require a mic.<br />For big, cinematic games, this headset is perfect. I can't hear anything outside it, people have to tap on my shoulder to get my attention when I have it on, but it's not so bad as to make you completely deaf.<br /><br />I love it, I'm beyond happy with it, it's ability to register my games already installed and prepare a profile to make my own personal setting for them is more than what I expected.<br />Buy it with the warranty! It's worth those few extra bucks, because I don't want to lose this headset and a 2-4 year warranty allows the money you spend on this headset to really last!",

Aluminum and Carbon Fiber design is top notch.  First Dell laptop that I have owned that did not overheat...Score 1 for Dell.  Doesn't get the battery life they claim of 9 hours, but I get a goo solid 4.  Considering Dell battery life on their other laptops outright suck, at least Dell is getting closer to the numbers they advertise.  Decent port selection, but good have included a full HDMI.  No worries an adapter fixes that issue.  Screen is smaller than what I am used too, but nice.  I don't give a hoot about the 3200+ display.  Who actually uses that?  I got the touch display.  I love touch displays on Lenovo.  I have found them useless on Dell, unless you chop the physical keyboard off.  Why have an onscreen keyboard?  Again Useless feature that you pay a lot more for.    Now for the cons:  This is a very slow laptop.  My 2013 Lenovo with Haswell's i7 dual core kicks the XPS 13 butt.  I am having network problems.  drops network and is very slow on my network.  For instance it takes a long time to download webpages with images...So the Microsoft store is slow...It can't handle multiple jobs at once.  The speakers suck.  They are either too loud or too quiet.  No in between and they sound horrible.  The mic is useless unless you want people to see your hand or up your nose.  The Mic in my laptop doesn't work and Dell will not do anything about it.    And then there is the issue of Dell.  They have the absolute worst tech support and customer care.  The manager actually offered my $50 in grievances for having to deal with their own tech support.  They have done nothing to help me and they honestly don't care.  I have spent the equivalent of 5 days with them on the phone over the course of a few months on issues with this computer and others.    *************This is an update to my review above**********************  I updated all drivers and windows updates that I could find updates for and performance has actually declined.  Cannot stream music from youtube without the audio cutting in and out.  Cannot stream video.  Tried downloading a game from the microsoft store called Talisman.  Runs the game, but very choppy.  It is having trouble with the graphics.  The screen blinks in and out.      Overall, I am so disappointed with Dell.  I have purchased the XPS 13 and XPS 15 in the past 2 months and both have been riddled with hardware and software problems.   My Lenovo Thinkpad (2013 version NOT 2014) was the only computer that I have owned in the past 12 months that actually provided me with the performance and reliability that I wanted...    Read reviews on the XPS 12, 13 and 15.  After about 30 to 60 days the laptops seems to become riddled with issues that Dell doesn't seem to do anything about...Be careful when buying from Dell and be sure that you know what you expect and how to fix things if they break.  Its all on you.",

The case is amazing!<br /><br />Material:<br />It is super flexible - I tried twisting it a little before putting it on the macbook and it proves to really be sturdy, no cracking noises or anything. Doing the same with my old InCase cover it actually broke right away.<br /><br />Case layout:<br />The heat dissipation is so much better than the InCase, as there are more cut-outs on the bottom and it seems they are located better, as well.<br />With this one the ports have one big cutout, not individual cut-outs, which enhances the usage experience.<br />With the old one the kensington lock for example had a hard time, since the cover was between the lock and the inlet.<br /><br />The feet:<br />One thing I was very skeptical about were the feet. I thought them to be ugly looking, potentially falling out all the time and was already planning on cutting them off.<br />But they turned out to be very well made, disappearing in the bottom of the cover when not in use and very solidly arrested, whether expanded or collapsed.<br />They lift the aft of the macbook by about an inch or so when expanded, which makes for a comfortable writing position and also helps dissipating the heat.<br /><br />The looks:<br />I chose the clear cover, as I got it for a white macbook and I like the looks of it. The visible color remains the original color of the macbook.<br /><br />Weight and Bulk:<br />This cover is very lightweight and adds no bulk to the macbook. I am using a neoprene sleeve for it when out and about and the macbook slidesinto it way easier now, compared to the InCase case, that I used before.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I am highly satisfied with this case!<br />I actually ended up dumping the (still good) InCase case on my black macbook and replacing it with one of these as well (also a clear one).",

Most video card makers have been shipping their 650 Ti cards at a 1.087V load voltage. Unfortunately MSI decided to set their load voltage lower at 1.062V. This makes it a bit harder to overclock.<br /><br />If you plan on overclocking this card further get the latest versions of MSI Afterburner, GPU-Z, and Furmark (easier to use than MSI Komblaster); and the latest Nvidia drivers.<br />Since the load voltage is locked, the voltage control option in Afterburner has no effect on the GPU core voltage. I put the card under 100% load and monitored the GPU core voltage at both +0 and +100 offset; it never changed from a maximum reading of 1.062V. Also the Power Limit (%) is grayed out. This is because the 650 Ti does not have the Boost Clock feature.<br /><br />But even with the locked core voltage I was able to overclock the core clock to 1223Mhz and the memory clock to 6600Mhz, not too shabby.

I may have to break down and buy a 2nd one in a fun color just to change things up every now and then.

I have had the notebook for about 2 days now, and am very happy with it. It's a solid piece of kit, very well build, and quite handsome. It is also slim, and light, which is exactly what I was looking for when I upgraded from my 1.5 year old Acer Timeline X. It is svelte enough that, at the software company where I work, I had several people stop by when it was sitting on my desk to ask about it, and declare that they want to get the laptop themselves. Also, working at a software company, we were overjoyed that the default browser loaded on the system was Chrome, and that it is relatively free of bloatware. 2 MAJOR pluses for Lenovo.   The performance is solid, although I also purchased a second generation Push2TV device from Netgear, and it won't connect to it. I am going to update all of the drivers on the machine, and see if I can get it to work, as I have tried a number of other solutions (difficulty in getting WiDi to work seems like an extremely common problem which is not confined to Lenovo devices after some quick Google searches).   Also, the keyboard is a touch cramped, a natural extension of the relatively small screen, but I wish the keys would run closer to the edges, and that the shift and ctrl keys were made a little wider. I have big hands, and I have found it virtually impossible to hold shift and hit the question mark next to it without looking down, because of how close the two keys are to each other. I invariably end up adding a \\\\\">\\\\\" instead of a \\\\\"?\\\\\". But I am able to type quite quickly on the keyboard, and I imagine that it will only get better as I get more used to it.  Also, as mentioned by the other reviewer, the battery life isn't great. I have burned through 4% of it just writing this review over the last 8 minutes. Granted, I like to keep my screen bright, and I am running a remote desktop client,with my CPU usage hovering around 30%, so that will naturally drain the battery a little more quickly, but my Timeline X has battery life that exceeds this computer's by miles.  Those are my main gripes with the machine. The build quality is impeccable, unlike what the other reviewer (the only other, thus far) noted, I don't have issues with noises when the lid opens and closes, and none of my keys rub up against the body. Hopefully mine is the more typical, or there will be some very unhappy customers out there.  The screen is bright and I find it to be quite attractive, while the matte finish keeps glare at bay. I also have been running fairly intense processes, and while the 4GB of RAM and 1.8 GHz of i7 doesn't make for the fastest beast on the block, for a computer this size, it is actually quite impressive.  All in all this is a very capable device. If you are looking for a slim computer, I don't think you can do much better. I spent some time with the Acer S3, the Asus UX31, The Toshiba Portege Ultrabook, and the Samsung Series 9, and am very happy that I chose the Lenovo. I like it far more that those computers. If you want to save some money, and need some more battery life, I was very happy with my Timeline X. If you want thinner and lighter, I don't think you will be disappointed by this computer.",

My 4 year old has already gotten finger happy but fortunately, being that I just had that card in there, it didnt go through.

The external device opens the DVD player app automatically after I insert the DVD, or I can open the app first and insert the DVD.  Either way works well.  The device even skips over the damaged areas of the discs with ease and continues on to the next good segment.  The device is lightweight and so far so good with it being able to play DVDs and no damage.

I have mother-in-law over my garage, and without the Almond, my original wifi router barely permitted me to open my email on a laptop in the mother-in-law. Netflix could not be streamed at all on the Wii up there. After adding the Almond as a range extender, we now have full internet access and no problem streaming Netflix in the mother-in-law.<br /><br />Furthermore, the set-up is ridiculously easy. I literally did it in less than three minutes, including taking the plastic off the box.<br /><br />I've never bothered to write an Amazon review before, perhaps because I never thought my purchase so entirely merited a positive review.

The replacement was a refurbished mouse that was broken from the moment we got it.  So then there was many more back and forth emails.  The worst part was Razer wanting us to pay for shipping back the second broken mouse they had sent us.  Thankfully Amazon made things right.  Thank you Amazon!  6/25/15 Update: The replacement, new mouse Amazon replaced this with worked great for another year or so. After that, random disconnects made the mouse unusable. Research found that it's a problem with the mouse starting to fail (tried all sorts of solutions, from bios settings to power settings for USB ports to trying different ports: nothing disconnects except the mouse, on any port).  When it works, it's a great mouse, but it seems they are built to last about 6-12 months from my experience (again, we've gone through three of them). Going back to another brand. Again, thank you to Amazon for dealing with this in a professional manner and sending us a new mouse\u2013we feel we got our money's worth ONLY because Amazon fixed the situation with a product that quickly becomes faulty.

While I was recording the video, I felt my phone getting a bit warm, so I shut the phone off. Much to my surprise when I opened it back up, all the pictures and files saved on the sd card were gone.<br /><br />I have tried various times to recover much over 500 photos that were at critical times in my life, but much to my dismay I could not recover anything from my 128gb Micro sd card. Eventually I was able to recover just the thumbnails, which were extremely low quality when blown up. I proceeded to put in the 64gb card to work as a backup, but I should've expected it to die out like the last one. So today it died out with not as many files on it, but I guess the card was such low quality that it couldn't even try to pretend like it was a real micro sd card....<br /><br />In losing all my photos I have learned a valuable lesson to back up my files and to actually purchase a good sd card for my phone. I do want all my photos back, but there's nothing I can do about that now since my computer can't even detect a storage device when I plug in my cards (meaning that they're completely burnt).

(There is a workaround posted on the Internet.)  I can't imagine what they were thinking to ship a notebook which throws in a 3 second delay every time you open Internet Explorer. I also can't imagine not turning on the computer before shipping it to me and seeing that error messages were coming up.    Finally, I purchased a 1 year onsite service agreement but the tech support personnel said they had no record of it even though it is clearly marked on my invoice and so they would not send a tech person out. Instead, they told me it needed a new mainboard and I could ship the unit back and wait for them to fix it.    Well, I summarize:    1) Purchased \\\\\"ONSITE\\\\\" warranty but the company refused to send a technician out for a nearly DOA machine.     2) As configured, there is an annoying 3 second delay every time you open a new tab in IE7.     3) Machine shipped with a defective TPM security chip and it appears the manufacturer never even turned the computer on to test the inital bootup and see the error message.",

I spent HOURS AND HOURS trying all kinds of technical things and never got the wifi to work again.  It became much easier to purchase an external USB adapter.

I went to radio shack, walking distance from my apt, and asked which one was a good seller with few returns and they pointed to this one.<br /><br />Installation was quick and easy and I get fast enough connections but no one mentioned that because it sticks out a few inches it is subject to easily getting bumped if you move your notebook from room to room, or have it on your lap.  Then you lose your connection and have to unplug and replug, and then wait for the connection to go through.  Mostly this is not a terrible hassle, but sometimes, if you want to print something out and it gets bumped, then it becomes annoying.<br /><br />I've had it for about 6 months now and other than the bumping, it seems to work just fine.

If you want to used the advanced features such as filtering access from various devices -- laptops, iPods, etc., it might not satisfy you.  PROS:  -price, advertised capability, range, online customer support (technicians actually know the product vs. reading from a script), works well with my laptop 2ft from my microwave and 5ft from my cordless phone base station.  CONS:  -firmware limitations or bugs.  I have the router installed on the 3rd floor. I consistently get around 100 Mbps throughput on floors 2 and 3. I max out at 130 Mbps. On the first floor, I get around 60 Mbps (still better than \\\\\"g\\\\\"). I was using fw 1.10B13 and everything was fine until I tried filtering my son's new iPod touch via the MAC address. It turned out there was a bug in the MAC address filtering which was fixed in 1.10B19. I upgraded and MAC address filtering worked correctly, but now the LAN wifi client DHCP connection is periodically dropped and not restored until the router is reset. So I can either filter my sons access to internet or have a reliable wifi connection. My solution... time to move on to a different vendor's product. For $24, it is worth buying if you are using g-mode or no wifi while you get educated on what you want to spend \\\\\"real\\\\\" money on.  UPDATE: This is the same hardware as a D-Link unit.

If you look at the picture you can clearly see that the POE ports have the amber colored LED and are within the box that is labeled POE.  Ratings for a product should not be based on your oversight of important facts.<br /><br />2 - The switch is very quiet, well maybe not if you're putting it next to your child's crib.

A typical server runs about 70-80 dB while this switch is rated at 40.2 dB, which in turn means that a typical rack mount server is anywhere from 8-16x louder.<br /><br />The powerful features, Cisco quality, and great price make this switch an absolute awesome device.

I had one laying around with old photos and music and the like that I would rather save than toss out as junk. So I bought the DSC9 as a solution. I read the brief instructions and hooked up the old formatted seagate ide drive that was the system drive to an old computer running XP, exactly as directed, placing the jumper on the master setting. My destination computer was my laptop, an I7 running windows 7. The drive was recognized but access to it was denied. Looking at the properties, the drive showed no volume information and 0 bytes used. Everything else said it was working, so I tried to force an update to that info using windows drive tools, no luck.<br /><br />So in reading other reviews here on Amazon, I figured I was doing something wrong. I went to the tried and true method of elimination. I tried the cable select jumper setting and the slave jumper setting and still didn't get a read of the data I knew was on the drive.<br /><br />Then I decided I needed to be more methodical. So this is what I did.<br /><br />1) I rebooted my laptop each time before I tried a different jumper setting.<br />2) I changed the jumper select each time with the test drive unconnected and unpowered.<br />3) I hooked up the Sabrent to the test drive unpowered each time making sure the connections were solid.<br />4) I powered up the test drive and waited a minute before making any USB connections to the laptop.<br />5) Finally, I connected the USB cable to the laptop. I got test drive readability and function only in the slave jumper mode.<br />6) Everything worked and I recovered the drive's data with no further issues.<br /><br />I've only tested this one drive, so I can't speak to other drive manufacturers, but I finally got the DSC9 to work with my drive. The jumper select seemed to make the difference. I would try it each way before giving up. One star off for the poor manual and website instructions which really didn't help and were written for the DSC5. I didn't bother to call Sabrent for help.",

True given the rather limited output, these would not be suitable for a display at a convention or a raging party, but they are perfect for a hotel room, (quiet) dorm or office.  Yes, there are three wires (2 for the speakers the other from the music source (ipod, mp3)) but the advantage is that you can space the speakers farther apart then with other speakers I've seen.

There are some downsides: I'm still getting used to the trackpad (no distinct buttons - a first for me), and it isn't quite as thin as the marketing pictures would suggest (though the listed product dimensions are accurate), but I think this laptop is a great deal for $800.<br /><br />After it arrived, I booted into Windows 8 to make sure all the hardware was working. After specifically testing the function keys and the speed of restarts, I updated to the latest BIOS, disabled UEFI Secure Boot, and then installed Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop 64-bit from a USB flash drive. Another reviewer lamented the space lost to the pre-existing partitions (I found boot, efi, Windows recovery, Windows OS, and factory recovery), but I opted to let Ubuntu have the entire disk (minus a couple hundred MB for two boot partitions). After formatting, it gave me 117.3 GB total, with 4.5 GB used by the OS after installing.<br /><br />Once I was running Ubuntu 13.04, almost all of the top-row function keys (e.g. sleep, keyboard backlight adjust, screen brightness adjust) worked out-of-the-box. The exceptions are that wireless enable/disable doesn't always seem to work and I haven't had a chance to test the video output selector. The screen auto brightness doesn't work, nor do the function keys attached to C, V, and Space (in the factory configuration those last three were attached to software bundled by Asus within Windows, so I suspect that I could configure apps in Ubuntu to respond in a similar fashion, but I have not tested this).<br /><br />The Bluetooth, USB-to-Ethernet (using the included adapter), web cam, built-in mic, and SD card reader components have all also been tested and they all work well without any configuration.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sleek, portable, Ubuntu-ready laptop which doesn't sacrifice power or break the bank, I would recommend giving this laptop a chance.<br /><br />== 2013-11-02: Edited review to add comments after almost five months of use ==<br /><br />This has continued to be a fantastic mobile computer for me. The performance of this laptop, coupled with its slim and lightweight nature, make this a very easy and plentifully capable computer to take with me on trips or to meetings.<br /><br />It's not perfect: I've gotten more used to the touchpad, but it will still sometimes 'tap' when I'm typing on the keyboard and my palm brushes the surface of the touchpad. I think this is due to the touchpad driver in Ubuntu, and while I've tried a couple of workarounds I've not been happy with the results and have reverted back to the 'stock' Ubuntu driver configuration.<br /><br />I have not yet tried Ubuntu 13.10, though I'm looking forward to giving it a spin after any \\\\\"early adopter\\\\\" bugs are found and fixed. :-)<br /><br />As I said in my original review, if you're interested in a Ubuntu laptop I think you'll find this is a great option!",

I have done that before and refused to do it this time.  I asked to speak to a superviser.  I was put on hold and then disconnected.  I called back and spoke to a representative.

Now I did notice a huge speed drop whenever I start a scan on AVG and this is odd because my HP pavilion slimline has a Pentium processor and it runs just fine with avg running. I don't know if that is an issue with Windows 8 or not, but still this computer is worth the price. Now I will agree with some that have said that it has kind of a cheap feeling to it but it doesn't feel like its going to break it just doesn't feel as sturdy as some may want. Now thats pretty normal in today's laptops when I was browsing the selection of laptops at Frys there were some really flimsy laptops and they had way worse specs, but that's just me. If you are looking for an affordable laptop that can play games on decent settings and do all of your schoolwork then this is the laptop to buy. Its super easy to turn off the touchpad just right click on the icon at the bottom of the desktop pannel and turn off touchpad.

The claims process was quick and easy, a shipping box arrived in a couple of days and when the laptop proved unrepairable, a check was sent for the list price of the unit (I'm still waiting on it, so the final disposition is still pending).<br /><br />Good company, good service.

This swivles 360 degrees.<br />- a pop-out stand which has a bottle opener (nifty!)<br />- a clear plastic screen which provides protection for your screen. NOTE: my ipad already has a screen protector, and there is no problem with touch recognition for the screen with this extra layer of protection.<br /><br />I prefer slim cases.

Especially convenient are that its light weight, the keys feel good and give excellent tactile feedback, it mimics the Mac keyboard very nicely, and getting rid of the wire is a great boon in my setup.  The one thing that you should be careful about if you should buy this keyboard is the on/off switch.  It's tiny, plastic, and has a very short throw.  It's best operated with a fingernail.  I've had the keyboard for less than a month, and its convenience has just about paid for itself already.  But I expect that the on/off switch might not last.<br /><br />Recommended, with one reservation<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I've discovered three more reasons to doubt the quality of this keyboard, and I'm subtracting a star.  The bottom has six short anti-skid strips of rubberized material.  If you're using the keyboard on a slick surface, they prevent the keyboard from sliding around freely, since the bottom itself is slick plastic.  They come off.  In about a month of use on such a surface, two have already let go completely, and the residue of glue, both on the keyboard and on the little strips, is not very tacky at all.  I've super-glued those two back in place.  Also on the bottom surface of the keyboard are two pop-out feet to give the keyboard a more comfortable typing angle.  Unfortunately, they are pretty flimsy looking plastic.  Use them, and unless you're very careful when you move the keyboard around, these feet would break off easily.  Finally, back on the top surface of the keyboard, there's no indicator whatsoever when the caps lock key is on.  You have to type something, and if it's in the wrong case, you have to delete it and start over.<br /><br />Otherwise, the keyboard continues to function as it should.  I still enjoy the Mac-like layout.  But there are too many indications of shoddy manufacturing and lack of planning in design.<br /><br />Still recommended, but caveat emptor.",

First the retractable port is an idea whose time has not come.  It retracts as one is trying to shove it into the computer's slot--really clumsy and awkward.  Obvioulsy one is supposed to hold down the little sliding part but that's not easy to do, and certainly not intuitive.  Getting the stick out of the computer is no piece of cake either, it's very very tight, and I worry about damaging the computer.  Once it's in, possible error messages and pop-ups questioning my set-up are gratuitous; everything is just fine--copy the damned file, already!!

To use the card, simply stick it in the card slot of your camera and take photos in JPG format (not RAW). Download the EyeFi app from the company site (or from the Google store), and enter the code on the card case to pair the card with the software. Once paired, anytime you power up your camera and open the EyeFi app on the device to the app's homescreen, any new photos on the card will automatically be copied to your device. Once they are on your device, you can edit them using your regular editing apps and share via email or social networking apps, or you can share them directly from the EyeFi app.<br /><br />I found this card quite simple to use, once I figured out what settings I needed to use on my camera. The card ships with no instructions, other than a note to download the app from the company website. From the app, you can follow the help icon to get further support and instructions from the website. I tested the card as a second card in my Nikon 7100. I usually shoot in RAW. To make the card work, I had to tell the camera to use card 2 as RAW+JPG (card usage), then tell the camera to save in RAW+JPG (file format; 2 settings with the same label, but doing different things--confusing, but that's Nikon's fault, not EyeFi's). Once I had the camera saving as JPG on card 2, the transfers worked flawlessly onto my Samsung Galaxy Tab. It was quite handy to have instant access to high quality images from my camera that I could share immediately in the field. The transfers are also useful for getting instant backups on the cloud, just in case something should go wrong with my RAW images on my main card. I also tested the card with a Canon PowerShot SX 210, a Nikon D90 and a Nikon D50. The card worked fine with the SX 210 and D90, but could not be used even as a regular camera card in the old D50. You can check the EyeFi website to see if your camera is listed as compatible with the card.<br /><br />The speed of the transfers isn't exactly instant--they do take some time if your camera produces large files. And the write speed of the disk isn't blazingly fast. On the other hand, it's certainly fast enough for most purposes. The app is relatively easy to figure out. One handy feature offered in the settings menu of the app is the ability to load photos directly to an external storage card, which is essential if you fill the card, since many devices don't have 8Gb of storage available on the main card. I sure wish other apps made saving to the external storage card this easy. Overall, this card provides an inexpensive and easy way to make most modern cameras capable of sharing or transferring photos via WiFi.an check the EyeFi website to see if your camera is listed as compatible with the card.<br /><br />The speed of the transfers isn't exactly instant--they do take some time if your camera produces large files.

But when I tried to connect my existing Seagate drive to this as an additional drive, since I already have so much data on it, but it did NOT work. Maybe that's an issue with how my seagate was formatted as opposed to how its needed for WD. I'm not sure. But so far no luck.  So I ended up connecting the Seagate to the laptop and used the software to backup the data from Seagate to WD. That works just fine.    Software: It Sucks. I mean, it works but I don't like how it sets up the data. You have to enter a plan name and then a drive name and then on the WD there will be a long tree of folders like Y:\\plan_name\\software_name\\folder_name\\backupDrive_name\\data..... Its not easy to configure data back as I want it. Meaning it lets me select the folders I want to back up, but does not let me select how I want them to be arranged in WD. Basically it just maintains the same structure as my local drive.   So, I think instead of using this backup software, I might use something else, or just copy data directly to WD (Y:\\). But if I want to use the auto backup feature, then I dont like how the data is arranged.    Performance: It works very well. I tried watching movies, but that was too slow, but I blame that to my super old Router. As for the WD drive, I like its performance, backup speed, copies of backup and so on. Plus since we can access our data through web interface also, I might stick to the backup software for now, for when I travel internationally. So, I can have access to my data. The web interface is not bad. Its fairly easy to use.",

This is a perfect troubleshooting tool for anyone trying to test out how well their USB devices are working and charging.  This is a very nice dual display unit that simultaneously shows both the charging voltage and current passing through it.  The voltage is displayed in red and the current is displayed in blue with lit LED displays.  The meter can measure voltage from 3 to 10 VDC and current from 0 to 3 Amps. You can use it to test your USB power sources, USB devices and how they charge or even test your charging cables themselves to see it they are working.<br /><br />The meter has a 4 inch cable with a standard USB connector on it to attach to the USB power source.  There are two output ports on the device.  Output I is designed for use with devices that use combined charging and data cables like Apple devices. Output II is designed for use with Android devices that like to have two wires shorted together to boost the charging current and emulate that the device is plugged into an AC wall charger where it can draw the maximum charging current. Apple devices will charge in the Output II but in my testing they charged at a lower rate than in Output I.  I just wanted you to be aware of the difference in the charging rates between the two ports and using the correct output port will provide you a better test result depending on what type of device you are testing.<br /><br />I compare the unit to another LCD unit that I use and you can see how nice the colored and lit LED display is and how having two displays allows you to see the voltage and current readings simultaneously.  The device is rated to be accurate to plus or minus 1%.  I liked this meter a lot and the dual display speeds up the testing process.  I do not have to switch a switch to read voltage and then current.  The lit display is easier to read in bright light and in a darker area like behind a tower computer.  This is a good product and it performed well in my testing and evaluation.  It comes with a lifetime warranty from AboveTek.  I rated it at 5 Stars.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample.

I recommend a MiFi card if you are wanting to connect to the internet like the 3G iPad.

Waking in the middle of the night and stepping on the Kindle on my way to the bedroom. THAT was boneheaded.  The display was shattered and, while it lit up, no longer worked as a touch screen.<br /><br />Since I was in the middle of a book, and since Amazon couldn't immediately deliver the new one I was going to buy to replace it, I swung by my local Fry's and bought another.  While registering the new Kindle I saw the broken one in Manage your Kindle.  I'd forgotten that I'd added Service Net's 2 year extended protection plan.  I re-read the coverage details and, Surprise!!!, the plan covers accidents.  The plan description even mentions stepping on the thing.<br /><br />So, still dubious, I called the plan's toll free number.  I'm put into a phone tree for about thirty seconds, at which point a very friendly guy named Jason answers at a US-based call center. He asks for the email address used on my Amazon account, then the exact name on the account.  He waits very patiently while I fumble around for a minute to find the exact name I registered by Amazon account under.  Then, the name of the Kindle. I tell him.  He sees that it has a protection plan in place.<br /><br />Then he asks \\\\\"What's the problem with your Kindle?\\\\\"  \\\\\"Well, actually, I stepped on it.\\\\\" \\\\\"Oh, don't you hate that?  Did the screen break?  Touch screen doesn't work?\\\\\" \\\\\"Right.\\\\\"  Then he says \\\\\"No problem, I can have a replacement sent out immediately.  You should have it in two days.\\\\\"<br /><br />He told me that I had two options.  If I agreed to let him secure the order with one of my credit cards on file with Amazon, he said the replacement out in advance.  The card would only be charged if I didn't return the broken one within 30 days.  I could use the packaging the replacement came in.  He'd send me an email with a link to a postage-paid return label.  Or I could send in the defective one and receive a replacement within two days of their receipt of it.<br /><br />The credit card thing is standard on advance exchanges so I chose that option. Jason just asked me to confirm the last four digits and the expiration date on the card.  Then he said \\\\\"If you want to stay on the line another thirty seconds, I'll get the order placed and let you know when you'll receive the replacement.  Still rather flabbergasted at the painlessness of the process, I waited the half-minute.  Then our man Jason says \\\\\"I'm sorry to say that, with the weekend, the new one won't be there 'til Tuesday.  Is that OK?\\\\\"  This was late Friday night.  \\\\\"Yes.  Tuesday's terrific!\\\\\"<br /><br />Now it's Saturday as I type this.  I've obviously not received the replacement Kindle yet.  (I'll update this review when the process is complete.)  So far, however, this plan has been perfect and the process has been totally painless.  No long wait on hold.  No trying to communicate with someone in a third world call center. No need to find the plan number.  They had that already.  No need to find the serial number of my Kindle.  They had that from the nickname I'd given it.  And, best of all, no hassle at all for having stepped on the thing. The entire call lasted less than ten minutes and the rep was incredibly friendly.<br /><br />I could not be happier.<br /><br />Before I sat down to write this review, I took a look at the one and two-star reviews.  There you'll read complaints that the plan is being misrepresented as a two-year plan when the Kindle comes with a one year warranty.  None of the reviewers had actually purchased the coverage and, I guarantee you, none of them had stepped on their Kindles or dropped them in the bath.  Service Net is very clear in the description of the plan that this is a two year extension to Amazon's one year manufacturer's warranty.  I find the pricing for both the 3G and non-3G versions of the plan incredibly cheap.  Really: I STEPPED ON MY KINDLE.  BROKE THE CRAP OUT OF IT. THEY'RE REPLACING IT, IN ADVANCE, FOR NO CHARGE!  Not even for shipping.  This was a GREAT purchase!  I highly recommend you add it to any new Kindle purchase.<br /><br />[Note: this review is for the coverage on a non-3G Kindle. I just bought a 3G version and have added coverage to it based on my extraordinary experience with the non-3G coverage.]redibly cheap.  Really: I STEPPED ON MY KINDLE.  BROKE THE CRAP OUT OF IT.

From what was posted on the product page, I wasn't sure how I'd hook this system up. On my two exsisting systems, you have wires that run from the woofer to each of the speakers and these wires are standard speaker wire with bare wires at the ends that connect to the woofer. This system uses wires that end in RCA type plugs that one plugs into the woofer. This works out pretty good if you have enough speaker cable to reach from the woofer to where you want the speakers to go. (I did notice that the front speaker wire lengths were shorter than the back speaker wire lengths so one would have to select a speaker placement that had this in mind. This did cause me a minor problem but it wasn't a major one.) I also wondered about how inputs to this system would work. On my other two systems, inputs are handled by plugging RCA type cables from the source to the woofer of this system. When I was considering buying this system, I couldn't at first figure out how the inputs were handled  so I thought that the RCA to RCA plug route was how it worked. After I checked around a bit I discovered that this system truly is intended to be use with a Sound Blaster card as shown by the way the inputs are dealth with.<br /> This system's input don't have plugs on the back of the woofer they just come out the back thru a gormet. The inputs end in 3.5 mini plugs that exactly match to jack on a Sound Blaster sound card. One covers L&R front, one L&R back, and one woofer and center speaker. This system plugged right into my SB Audigy card without any needed adapters. If you plan to use it with another sound card of some other output source then you might need adapters to do this.<br /> This sound is prety darn good for a system at this price range. I've own systems that had 12\\\\\" woofers on them and while this system can't match them, it does a really good job or handling what I throw at it. In fact, it's just to loud if I turn it up too far! The only thing I've run into were a couple of settling in pops and a bit of static that was taken care of by making sure the inputs plugs from the speaker were plugged solidly into the sound card's jacks. (This was one the thing I thought I had a problem with at first when I first turned them on, but that turned out to be one of the plugs wasn't all the way in the sound card's jack.<br /> The only other thing that I feel needs to be mentioned is the location of the woofer speaker itself. This system's woofer speaker is on the bottom of the woofer's enclosure. So you really need to sit the woofer encloser on the floor to get the best sound, I minor point but I feel an important one. Also the woofer speaker has no cover over it so when handling it be careful not to touch the under side of the woofer encloser as you might damage the woofer.<br /> Overall I think a pretty good buy!!",

I had to disable the pinky side buttons as I often press them and have just learned to ignore accidental clicks from them.  I really like the fact that the scroll wheel does not tilt as it makes the scroll wheel much easier to press down, vs logitech where I have to be very careful to press straight down.  The weight of the mouse is good and the cord doesn't bother me, which  I was worried about since I've been using a wireless G9 mouse for several years - the cord doesn't &#34;push back&#34; on the mouse as some do.  I game a lot but I tend to just stick with the basic buttons, so this mouse suits me fine, and while I installed the software I haven't done much with it.

I had thought that this meant I would NOT be charged the monthly fee as it wasn't the latest unit. I was wrong. I wanted this to replace my current phone company's local service - Century Link/aka Qwest... they were charging me around $28/month for home phone with no long distance service. I had some issues hooking this up as it turns out the wiring in my house was not done correctly but that did get resolved. I found out I didn't need the scout unless I wanted a 2nd line. I ported my phone number which Ooma charges $39.99 to do. What I do notice, and this may be because I'm on 1.5GB DSL, is that the service with Ooma in the evenings (when everyone wants to be online) is not perfect. I get intermittent times with dropped voice sounds... like every few words the sound drops out. During the daytime, especially mornings, it is fine. It is nice to have long distance for free. My monthly bill from Ooma is $4.15 or so which covers taxes only. I didn't have caller ID before, and that is nice. Like I said, you don't need the scout unless you want a 2nd line. I have mine set up so my home answering machine answers first. If I'm on the phone and someone calls, they can leave a message on the Ooma machine which I like. I would recommend this if wanting to save on home phone service... but buy the newer model - it's cheaper - if you only want the 1 line. If you want more than 1 line, get this one. The customer service has been good so far (India). The only way to save the monthly charge is if you activated your OOMA years ago and haven't changed it since. If you purchase a used unit, which was activated prior to the charges, you will have to pay to re-activate it and thus the monthly charge will happen.",

All ports with easily accessible and touch screen response was normal with the protective screen cover built into the case. Camera's and Microphones were not impeded on either. I really like the kick stand on the case, it is very durable and pops out and in with ease. This provides a really nice prop up stand for your iPad to view movies or play games on without holding it. The leather strap is quality material also and feels like its made to last quite a lot of use.<br />I'd say the case added about half a pound or so of weight to the overall iPad Air weight, which is not bad for so much protection it offers up. This would be a case for this who work outside or travel a lot with your iPad. It protects against the weather, and if you have a stylus the strap grip underneath makes it a nice tablet to write on with a stylus. Another overall win from New Trent.",

Certainly, my website comes up just as well, if not slightly faster, than the old system, but is using a fraction of the power that the old one did.    I have tried some media streaming with the system and, for the most part, it works alright.  For sending files to my PS3 to watch on the TV, it seems to stream quite well.  For Hulu, the video can get somewhat \\\\\"choppy\\\\\" (I have a 6 Mbps internet connection), but I think that's because I'm using the integrated Intel graphics chip.  I'm also using Ubuntu 10.10 as the operating system.    So I recommend this motherboard and processor combo for basic work and basic media playing.  2 GB of RAM works pretty well with it, but I'd go with 4 GB if you can, depending on your needs.  If you want to run an HTPC-style media system for your television, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding a video card.

Follow the onscreen prompts to restore your OS install to the new drive.<br />- word of warning: this process WILL DELETE YOUR PERSONAL FILES/APPS.

These are in a different class than your standard desktop case, and are sorted by different features.    The main things to consider:  1. Motherboard form factor:  ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX  2. Expansion cards: do you want to be able to use full height expansion cards, half height cards, or none?  3. Built in display (VFD or LCD): Either the case has a built in spot for a display, or it doesn't  4. Optical drive bays accessable from the outside    This case has:  1. ATX motherboard (also supports Micro-Atx  2. Accepts full size expansion cards (which is why it is so tall  3. Has a built in VFD display with a remote and media center software  4. Only one optical drive bay available from the front    Pro:  Amazon's incredible price.  The display/remote combo usually costs like $100 just by itself.    Very solid construction, like all products from SilverStone.  Entire chassis is a very heavy metal, with a lighter aluminum front.    ultimate versatility with 4 hard drive mounting spots (a 5th with a 5.25\\\\\" to 3.5\\\\\" bracket), full ATX, and full height expansion cards    Remote has mouse emulation for navigating web pages (netflix?) without pulling out a real mouse    Con:  Dual 60mm fans in the back.  60mm fans are a waste of space.  The motor is bigger than the fan blade surface area.  They make a lot of noise for the amount of air they push.    No external drive bays (except of course the slot for the optical drive tray).  It would be nice to have the option of adding a card reader.    If your motherboards 24 or 20 pin power connection is at the very top right of the board, you will have to make a very sharp bend to get it connected.  The optical drive bay is only inches above this corner of the board.  You might want to plug it in before inserting the motherboard.    The cover for the optical drive bay just a piece of metal you stick to your optical drive tray with a piece of double sided tape.  This avoids the need for a spring loaded door that could break, but if you need to replace the drive, you'll need some more tape.  The case looks ok if you just leave it off if you have a black faced optical drive.    IR receiver isn't very sensitive.  You need to point the remote almost directly at the case for it to work.    I'm loving this in my entertainment center.  It's almost exactly the same size as my Onkyo 5.1 channel receiver (from the front).  It is very deep though, so make sure you measure before you buy.  The media center software is Ok.  If you have the option of using windows media center (XP media center edition, Vista home premium, or windows 7 home premium), I would recommend going with that.    The display is similar to what you would find on the front of a DVD or blu-ray player, but you can customize the content.  You can display system hardware info, network usage, and many other things.  Supposedly it can show you the weather, but the server it connects to seems to be down.  It does tell me how many unread e-mails I have (using pop3), and downloads news headlines.

You turn on the keyboard, press the bluetooth button you want to assign the device to (I picked the first Bluetooth button), and then navigate to the bluetooth settings in your device and select the keyboard (on the iPod/iPhone go to general -> settings and click on the keyboard).<br /><br />To hook this up to a computer without Bluetooth built-in, you will need to pick up a bluetooth dongle to plug into one of your USB ports. The connection to the keyboard will be quite simple after that point but will vary based on your OS.<br /><br />I was quite delighted to have the opportunity to review this item because it will allow those of us with smart devices but with larger typing requirements to get by when traveling without having to carry a heavy laptop about. I cannot bear to type for any length of time on a tablet or smartphone, and, as a writer, I need to type quite a lot almost all of the time. Packing this keyboard with a tablet will considerably lighten my load and keep me from having to use my personal carry-on item solely to transport a laptop and accessories.<br /><br />Typing on the keyboard took just a moment to adjust to. The keys are full size and spaced exactly as they are on my laptop (I placed the keyboard across my laptop to compare). The only thing I lament is the absence of a dedicated home key and end key as I use these quite often in word processing tasks. However, I have gotten accustomed to using the \\\\\"FN\\\\\" key and the arrow buttons to navigate up and down and \\\\\"home and end\\\\\". (Note: use FN and the down arrow to skip to the end of a page; use FN and the up arrow to go \\\\\"Home\\\\\"). I also love the look of the unit - it is polished looking without trying to hard.<br /><br />I think this is such a handy device that I will probably send my brother's family one for Christmas to use with their tablets and other handheld smart devices. The easy sharing and switching between units with the three bluetooth device buttons should make it a nice household item versus a one-user keyboard.<br /><br />Edited to add: When I purchased my new iPod touch fifth generation in December 2012 running iOS 6.0.1, it booted right up on channel two beside my previous iPod touch (4th generation) on channel one. I fully expected it to but wanted to share this for the curious!<br /><br />Edited to add (12/28/12): I just acquired a computer with Windows 8 and really like the addition of a dedicated app scrolling button on this keyboard. For the curious, it is the arrow in a box on the F4 button. This allows you to scroll through all of the open apps on your PC. It's very handy as it keeps me from leaving too many different apps open at one time since I can scroll through the open ones swiftly and close them.",

Well, if your fingers are small enough.<br /><br />That's an improvement over the typical one which has a layer of rubbery plastic OVER the long hard plastic clicker, because that clicker won't plug in as easily, using the typical style.  Even so, it's a pain.  You must be very gentle, and of course you must be sure you HEAR that 'click' when you plug the thing into router or computer, or you're sunk.<br /><br />The cables work.  But frankly I'm not sure they protect the 'finger'.  And, they are cumbersome to plug in, especially in tight corners, when you don't have small human fingers.  Not sure there is any good way to do that, without preventing you from being able to use the 'finger' as you need, for a sure connection.  Good news is, you can CUT the plastic alleging to 'protect' the finger.<br /><br />By the way, if you're an XFINITY user, you should have gotten a new modem/router with FOUR ethernet cables now at the back, so you can hook up four computers to it at any one time.

Then b), I have many computers, so the color coding helps me know which cable at the router, belongs to which machine (I refuse to use wireless or wi-fi, even though I have it).",

I figured it could have been due to frequency contention and upgrading to 5GHz would solve that problem. I was wrong. The 5GHz signal does not travel nearly as far, maybe half the distance. The good news is that the 2.4GHz band on this router works a lot better than my old one, easily picking up devices downstairs. So even though 5GHz was a dud for me, the 2.4GHz band works better than ever! It also has a decent feature set, but still not quite on-par with OSS firmware like DD-WRT. Still, I haven't bothered to load DD-WRT on this router because it can be a pain to find a build without bugs and I'm not really missing the advanced features (much--I run a Linux server so I moved DNS server functions over to that.)<br /><br />EDIT: I'm revising my review down to 2 stars. There appears to be an issue with this router where it stops routing WiFi connections to the Internet. Internet searches reveal the same complaint. My laptop will be connected and I can ping all devices on my private LAN including the router, but attempting to ping Internet IP addresses fails. It seems the router stops routing them, possibly a NAT issue. Rebooting the router temporarily resolves the issue but it soon returns. I'm also running the latest available firmware.",

I didn't expect great sound quality or anything. My sole requirements were halfway decent sound and simplicity.  Having said that, here are some of the pros and cons.    Pros: Very small speakers. Easy hook-up (one cable plugged straight into computer. No need for a power chord.) Easy off and on button and volume control on the one speaker. Well built.    Cons: The cable that plugs into the computer is fairly short, I'd guess about 3 feet. So unless you get an extension cord, the placement is pretty limited. Also, the cable that connects the two speakers is only about 3' as well. Not an issue for me, but could be for someone else.   The sound quality is decent, but nothing stellar. A little bit on the \\\\\"tinny\\\\\" side, but like I said above, that's OK with me, and I didn't really expect anything else.    So in summary: It's a decent set of speakers for the price.

It outputs at 10-12 Mbps. Simple math says that is approximately a 60% drop in signal output. The range is fine. At the limits of my home, maybe 60 feet from the router, I'm still getting 10 Mbps, so it is sending out a strong signal, it's just sending out a signal that is 60% less than what it is receiving, no matter where you are in the house. At the limits of my home, I'm only getting a 50% drop off from the original router, so the end result is a stronger signal from the original than I'm getting from the repeater.<br />The first tech support person I talked to was mystified. \\\\\"Can't be happening,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"What did you do wrong?\\\\\" He had me update the firmware. Same result. He had me change from 20 to 40 Mhz. Same result - always the 60% drop-off. His last ditch effort was to have me change the channel in a trial and error effort to find a better fit for my modem. Here we found another problem for this piece of junk. You can't really change the channel. You change it once, then on the next reboot it reverts to auto and picks whatever it wants. Watch out: there's a work-around for this on the FAQ page. It doesn't work. Finding that problem was just a bonus, because it turns out, I had the right channel in the first place. The channel is not causing the 60% drop off.<br />The next tech support guy I talked to was a bit more forthright. \\\\\"Oh,\\\\\" he says. \\\\\"That's normal.\\\\\" In fact, their own tech support guy advised me not to buy any of their higher priced routers because they would all have the same 60% drop off. His take on the matter was that you only use one of these things if you need to extend the range beyond the limits of your original router. The repeater will extend the range well beyond the original router, but always with a massivelyreduced signal. So, unless you are trying to increase your coverage area out to a hundred feet or you're trying to get around lead walls or something, don't waste your money. This product will not help you in a single family sized home.<br />I picked this thing after reading other reviews because I was snowed by the one that said he was getting 18 Mbps output while repeating a 20 Mbps source. Sounds great, but according to Amped Wireless's own tech support, that's impossible. Good luck.",

I learned a great lesson from this...NEVER EVER purchase a Compaq computer. I've had the most difficult time with Compaq's tech support. It's very hard trying to convince them something isn't a software problem, but a hardware problem. After Compaq supposedly repaired my notebook the first time, they sent it back to me in non-working condition. Clear your calendar and be prepared to spend many hours and days on the phone with Compaq tech support. After numerous conversations, with what felt like most of Compaq's tech team, they replaced the hard drive for a second time. Too bad they couldn't get it right the first time around. Oh...the problems didn't stop there. The individual at the Compaq repair center didn't even reseal my notebook before sending it back to me. I was \\\\\"fortunate\\\\\" enough to have all of the factory settings still installed. To my delight, this meant another phone call to Compaq tech support. So now, after using my laptop (which is on its 3rd hard drive - sad for such a young notebook), my computer is making strange noises. Apparently the hard drive hasn't been fixed, after all. All of my complaining has fallen upon the deaf ears of Compaq personnel, but please take this as a lesson learned and stay away from Compaq hardware.

Pushing on the back of the bezel, or swiping the screen right to left will make it go away for the most part. Because I had bought the laptop at a time where I was going to be traveling quite a bit, RMAing wasn't an option (mostly because of the horror stories/turn around times for MSI). At some point I learned to just ignore the problem, which, given this thing's cost.. is stupid of me.<br /><br />Then a couple of months ago the left trackpad button started acting odd - the mechanism felt mushy, and you can tell looking at the left and right buttons, that something is odd with the left - it slants a bit in the bottom left corner. The fallout here is really that you hear a click/snap when you click that button, and clicking with the right most edge of button does nothing at all. Again, this coincided with a time where I would be travelling and need the laptop, so no RMA again.<br /><br />And now we're at today - the laptop is 8 months old - I come home from work and notice one of the front lights is flashing orange; I've never seen that before! Low and behold, it's the battery charging light. Looking at the battery widget in Windows, it shows the battery at 88% and &#34;plugged in but not charging&#34;. Rebooting does nothing. Reseting the EC controller does nothing. Running the battery calibration does nothing. Whenever the charge gets up to 88%, the battery charge light blinks red/orange, and it stops charging. Off AC, my battery life is now... a third of what it was? The laptop dies in about 30 minutes on battery, where as literally the day before, it could make it 2-3 hours.<br /><br />So, this is the last straw - I'll RMA it and deal with out having a laptop for a month. And by the sounds of it, I'll get back the same laptop that MIGHT have the problem fixed.. or not, and get to repeat the process.<br /><br />It's just discouraging for a laptop at this price to hit these issues, but also have a support system that leaves you without your hardware for weeks.",

The TM2T also comes with a (stored) C/R pen which gives you pinpoint-accurate control if you don't want to use your fingers. And being a real PC, you can run eleventeen applications at once.

However you're not going to get a 4000dpi mouse for $25.00.  But does one really need a 4000dpi mouse?    The look and construction of the mouse is very good, it feels great in your hand, and the blue lights surrounding it (in my opinion) are very cool and a nice change from the usual Red you see on every other optical mouse.    I was a little worried the two buttons on the top of the mouse to turn up and down the dpi would get in the way of gaming and the mouse wheel, but they're actually well placed and very accessable when you need them in the heat of battle and they don't get in the way in the slightest.    The reason I gave the Habu a 4 star rating is that it was an utter pain in the (pick your favorite body part, I'm going with posterior) to get the thing recognized by Windows.  At first I immediately pluged the Habu in my Windows 7 machine and it saw a USB device but it didn't know what it was and just said 'unknown device.'  I mean grr, A Microsoft OS not recognizing a Microsoft device?!?!  I'm guessing the device recognition problem was due to the mouse being manufactured in 2006 which of course is well before Windows 7.  I wasn't ready to give up though so I spent a few >>HOURS<< looking at forums and such trying to get this thing recognized by Windows and everything kept pointing to the firmware not being up to date.  Now don't get me wrong, I was more than willing to dive into updating the firmware, but again it wasn't even recognized by Windows so how could I update it?  And to boot, Windows 7 was disabling the Habu/device saying it was malfunctioning.  I finally decided to take the Habu to work where they're still using XP and try pluging the mouse in there... again, unrecognized USB device message... so I was about to give up and send it back but then I found the solution...    Now I can't speak for all of the Habu's as maybe you'll get one with the latest firmware or a later manufacturer date but I bought the one listed at $25.00 (if it's still available when you read this) so if you get that one you'll most likely need to do the following to get its firmware updated and recognized by Windows...    I had to jump through a few hoops and combine a few downloads worth of drivers and firmware, but now it's working perfectly so hopefully this will save you some time and a headache.    First get the latest driver from [...] and install it (without the Habu pluged in).  The firmware however isn't located in the latest driver (at the time of this writing).  I had to download an older driver (which indicated it had a firmware update in its description) that had a separate folder called firmware that I grabed and put to the side.    I then had to get their, what I'm guessing is a generic version of their interface software called 'Copperhead' and install that.  Basicly all we're going to use the Copperhead software for is to be able to point it to the firmware file for the Habu.  I tried the firmware update option through the latest Habu interface software but it just opened the Razer web page when I clicked on the firmware update option.    Next (still not having the Habu pluged in) hold the small button on the bottom of it down and plug it in and continue holding it down... it should hopefully be recognized not as a mouse but a 'Freescale USB JW32 ICP Device.'    Finally, open the Copperhead software and click on 'save/load settings,' you're going to see an update firmware option, click it, and point it to the firmware you downloaded and put to the side earlier... you should then see a progress bar indicating it's updating.    Once updated, unplug/plug the Habu and it should then be seen by Windows as 'Habu Mouse' and you should be good to go.    Other than the pain described above, this is an excellent mouse and I'd go through all the problems again for it as it's that good and you simply can't beat the price!",

We found good apps and bought a few books but they're still hard to shop for and the money adds up quickly.<br /><br />Enter the Kindle Fire. For $3/mo, you get Kindle FreeTime. The apps are tagged by age and they seem to have found all the high quality Android apps. The videos are top notch, presumably also from Prime. You can find content by character (Sesame, Dora, etc). You can virtually unlimited high quality books. You can't put a price on the amount of stimulation that your kids will learn from this! FreeTime is very nicely refined and I love that I can control how time is divided up by activity.<br /><br />After using it for a day, my daughter promptly announced that her younger brother can have the iPad mini. This one is hers! For kids, a cheaper $130 is perfect. My only concern is that it doesn't have a mic so some apps won't work for kids (Ubooly for example). I haven't found any, though, so bought the next higher end model in the mean time.<br /><br />As a general tablet, I'm sort of bleh on it though. The OS is very nice but the lack of integration with Google services is a killer. Sure you can check your email and calendar but there's no Hangouts. You can use Skype instead if that works for you. Cheap 4G data plan isn't so useful anymore with the free T-mobile data plans now (supposedly the AT&T version here isn't locked and you can stick in a T-mobile SIM card). The lack of momentum for the Amazon ecosystem makes me leery of getting used to it as well. The screen is grogeous, better than the newer iPads even.

I was a little nervous at first because other motherboards with similar overclock abilities cost twice as much and more so I had no idea what to expect out of this board. It arrived SUPER fast as usual, it took 2 days from my order date and it came from USPS. I tried to get the board from newegg but they are always sold out because of high demand. There are 2 revisions of this board and I was sure I was going to get an older model because I didn't think amazon pushes many motherboards. I ended up getting the newer revision 2 with a newer bios that supports 45nm chips. If you get an older version of this board with older bios, you may have a problem getting it to POST with a 45nm chip.  I've had my new gaming PC assembled for about a month now and this board is better than I was expecting. It is very easy to overclock within bios (you must press CTRL+F1 at bios menu to access advanced OC menu). I keep my E8400 at 3.5ghz on my stock cooler, once the new cooler comes in I plan to keep it 4.0ghz. Be sure to manually set your RAM\\CPU voltage as well as your CPU\\RAM\\pci-express mhz speed, the factory setting for all of these can be different then what the manufacturer specifies for your part#. Try to stay away from the windows based overclock tool that comes on the software CD, it is seems very buggy and unstable. Assembly was a snap, the instructions manual covers EVERYTHING, including some of the advanced overclock features. I highly recommend this board to anyone interested in a low-cost overclockable motherboard.

The first edition was around the same price, but had a much larger screen and while that may just be disappointing to me, especially since there are larger options, I liked that the base model was one size and affordable. I bought the 6&#34; edition because it was affordable, and I really didn't want to dish out more cash just for a bigger screen.  My other issue is the battery life. I have it on power saving mode, I keep the screen dim, and yet the battery just seems to run out so quickly. My original fire only needed a charge once a week, and that was with consistent use at night. My new fire needs to be charged at least every other day, and often, every single day. I find this really annoying because if I have to be constantly charging my fire then I am not getting as much convenient use from it.  On the bright side, it's nice to be able to read on a kindle again. I am not a big fan of reading books on my phone, and the kindle paper isn't really an option for me since I do most of my reading at night and prefer to just dim the screen on my kindle and use a bluelight filter so as not to strain my eyes. This fire is as easy, if not more easy to navigate than my original fire and I like that when I purchase a book on my computer, by the time I turn on my fire later that night, it's already downloaded and ready to read even though it's on standby mode.  Overall, I miss my original. I miss the size and battery life. However, for the price I do think it's a great option. You can do everything you can do on a smart phone (aside from making calls outside of skype or texting) but on a much larger screen and I think the display is more clear. I don't regret my purchase and I am hoping that I find a way to make my battery last longer.  Updated 8/25/15: I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase. I will charge my fire to full, unplug it, and once I goto use it, the battery is completely drained. I get so little use from it because it is constantly dead. I have had to use my phone for reading my kindle books. It's almost a waste of time to even bother charging it since by the time I use it, the thing is dead. This is a huge flaw with this product and needs to be fixed. With my first edition fire, I could leave it in sleep mode, not fully shut down, for days and it would still have a battery that was at least 90%.",

Way too easy for a kid to get the silicone off, and this is going back almost as fast as the Griffin Survivor did, and we're back to the GumDrop for now, because that at least she cannot tear. Ruggedized my rear. If the silicone doesn't stay on it doesn't do jack.<br /><br />(The iPad is being used by a special needs child for communciation.)<br /><br />ETA: For comparison's sake:<br /><br />For an adult, this is probably a great option. But Otterbox is often seen as the \\\\\"case of choice\\\\\" for special needs children who use iPads for communication and learning. And for children who are capable of understanding concepts like \\\\\"gentle\\\\\" and \\\\\"leave the case on\\\\\" and \\\\\"Don't chew on it,\\\\\" it is probably fine. Weight wise, this was the lightest and sleekest of the three cases we have tried. (Otterbox, Griffin Survivor, GumdDrop)<br /><br />But for a severely delayed kiddo who NEEDS her iPad but cannot resist picking, twiddling, twisting, biting and manipulating things, it flat out doesn't work. The silicone sleeve comes off so easily. It is not very thick, so it tears readily. Even if it doesn't tear, little fingers pulling at it were able to deform the silicone so that it would not lie flat. She should NOT have been able to damage the case so readily.<br /><br />In fact, I found it challenging to get the silicone to lie flat even from first install. With great care I did succeed, but it did not take her long to simply roll the silicone off. The polycarbonate case was nearly impossible for me to get off, and she did not even try, but without the silicone the moisture resistance is very low. And this is a child who tends to drool a fair amount... so moisture control is essential. Anyone who is putting their iPad in the hands of a small child really needs to think about a case that is going to protect their iPad from the hands of someone who does not understand \\\\\"gentle\\\\\" and \\\\\"Don't chew on the case.\\\\\"<br /><br />The Griffin case did not survive long either. I believe it was an older model with a flap, not a hinge, but the flap came completely off from the power port, torn, the first long usage session.<br /><br />The GumDrop has survived months. It allows moisture to seep under the screen protector, but the iPad works despite being thrown, dropped, sat on, drooled on and gnawed on. She has not managed to damage the rubber housing *at all*, and that's the only case that that is true of.<br /><br />So it is possible to make a case that a child cannot tear, damage, or remove easily. But the Otterbox isn't that case. Which is a shame since it is so often recommended.",

It has a lot of features for WiFi setup and security settings, but is also easy to keep simple and it just works and keeps your network secure. The best things about the wireless are it is very fast, good interoperability with different devices, and has super range. Another benefit is if you are looking for additional wireless endpoints, PCI cards, media bridge, USB adapters or whatnot, you practically guarantee great speed by using other D-Link products.<br /><br />Some people complained about heat or the lights being too bright... Hmm - well it does get hot and the lights are bright. What can I say - if you are looking for great wireless signal and security then buy this. I also see there is a newer version of this device that is completely different. In my opinion I would buy this one instead and not the newer one.

            "input": "After much waffling, I bought this tablet with a handful of specific purposes in mind. First and foremost, I am a musician and wanted a tablet to read music on. While I'd really prefer a larger screen in a perfect world, what sold me on this one instead of one of the (relatively few) significantly larger ones was the stylus. I need to be able to make annotations in my music the way I would with a pencil. Zooming in and then writing with my finger doesn't cut it when I want to be able to write in small markings like accidentals, breath marks, cues, etc, in the middle of a rehearsal. Unfortunately there aren't nearly as many music score apps for Android as there are for iOS, and they don't necessarily all take as much advantage of the stylus as I wish they did, but there there are some and I found what I needed. And there are more Android apps all the time.<br />But regardless, the stylus makes a big difference and I think it makes this device a very competitive alternative to an iPad, even though more musicians seem to use iPads.<br />Incidentally, the actual surface area of the screen is about the same on the Note 10.1 as on the full-sized iPad. I actually prefer the iPad's aspect ratio, but that's not such a big deal.<br />In terms of reading music off of it, I still wish the screen was a bit bigger since I have to stand far enough away to not bang my instrument into the stand. But at the same time, I think it's easier to read smaller-sized notes off this screen than it is off of paper at the same size, and at least lighting isn't an issue.<br />Second, I wanted something that could be a lighter, more compact alternative to carrying around my laptop, but something big enough to be reasonably comfortable for general internet use and getting actual work done without being frustrated about not being able to see enough of it at once. For that, it's perfect. The stylus makes even just web browsing easier because it's easier to click on small links than by poking with myfinger. And being able to write in the text instead of typing on the &#34;imaginary&#34; keyboard on the screen is really great. I only wish you could do it any time there is a text box, instead of only in some cases, in some apps, or on some websites.<br />Samsung did go to a certain amount of trouble to add stuff that the stylus is good for, some of which is useful, but even aside from that, to me the stylus just generally enhances the ease of use by more than I expected.<br />Other odds and ends: the display looks really nice. The camera is good enough that I can take a photo of my music and comfortably read it off of that if I don't have time to scan it. People talk about the molded-fake-leather-texture back feeling cheap, but it feels fine to me. I don't really care about that; I put it in a case and don't really see the back much anyway. It's sort of annoying that the port for the charger is right at the bottom, which makes it awkward to use while it's plugged in.<br />But on the other hand, that hasn't been an issue much because the battery life is quite good.<br />So all in all, I've been very happy with it. So far, I'm satisfied with my choice of a device with a stylus over a device with a bigger screen.<br />But hey Samsung! A Galaxy Note with a screen the size AND aspect ratio of a regular piece of letter-sized paper (or even just reasonably close) would be AWESOME!",

I did so, and it finished downloading the update and said it was going to restart and install it.  The device restarted and just displayed the splash screen \\\\\"Kindle Fire\\\\\" for over an hour.  It had frozen.  Following the online support I was instructed to hold the power button for 20 seconds and turn it back on.  Same problem: it just displayed the splash screen.

I called Amazon's thickly-accented \\\\\"phone support\\\\\" and their only solution was to reboot the device and if it keeps occuring then it should be returned.  I understand this is a $200 tablet device, but their lack of customer service coupled with these forced updates that don't function makes for one unhappy Amazon customer.  Overall, it seems like Amazon rushed a product with no way to downgrade and remove updates or to restore it to factory condition.

I temporarily fixed the problem by gluing a little piece of paper to fill the groove in the plastic pad, but this only lasted about a month before the button was again unusable.       Since then, I have replaced the LX7 with an LX8. In comparison, the LX8 is a little wider, making the LX8 a bit more comfortable.

            "input": "Setting up this mini router is easy.  What's difficult is understanding and choosing the correct configuration.  The English description provided is somewhat broken and difficult to understand, although diagrams are provided.  I have three different networks running in my house, so I added this mini router in as a fourth -- testing it as a repeater, an access point, a bridge, a router, and a client.  Below are the differences between each mode and an example of the situations in which each might be employed.<br /><br />REPEATER MODE<br /><br />If you have a Wi-Fi signal in your house but the signal cannot reach to all corners, you can solve that by using this unit as a repeater.<br /><br />In my house, my gateway (a gateway is a router and modem combined into one unit) is in one corner of my house downstairs.  Upstairs in the master bedroom, I typically get one or two bars of signal.  With this repeater placed roughly in between the gateway and the master, I can get four or five bars.  The signal is good enough for me to stream an Amazon Prime video on my Kindle Fire without seeing any lagging, skipping or pausing.  It was all very smooth.<br /><br />ACCESS POINT MODE<br /><br />In the olden days, people would have wired routers.  The routers connected all the computers in a network with . . . wires (ethernet cables).  When they wanted a wireless signal, they hooked the routers up to an access point that they bought separately to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal.  Nowadays, the routers come with access points built in.<br /><br />So, when would you need to use access point mode?  When you travel.  Hotels usually offer ethernet connection.  If you want Wi-Fi, plug the ethernet cable into this unit and broadcast your own Wi-Fi signal.<br /><br />In my case, I have a powerline running throughout the house.  In some areas, I would like to have Wi-Fi access to those lines.  I connected an ethernet cable from the powerline to this unit and made it an access point.  In that way, I can use Wi-Fi on my Kindle Fire to access the internet on that powerline.<br /><br />It works very well.  I can get one or two bars of signal across one story and several rooms.  That's comparable to the signal I get from my gateway.<br /><br />BRIDGE MODE<br /><br />If you want your guests to have Wi-Fi access, but you don't want them on your network, you can use this as a bridge.  It communicates with your network via Wi-Fi and broadcasts its own SSID.<br /><br />I set this up using the Wi-Fi signal from my gateway.  The signal I get from my bridge works perfectly.  Understand that that network is open, no security password.  Everyone has access to the bridge.  As long as your guests are comfortable with that, you are good to go.<br /><br />ROUTER MODE<br /><br />This unit can function as a router, connecting directly to a modem to provide wirelsss or wired internet access to your devices.<br /><br />I used this with my gateway in router mode and I was able to get a signal equally as strong as I get from my gateway throughout my house.  It is amazing how such a small device can perform as well as a much larger one.<br /><br />CLIENT MODE<br /><br />If you have a Wi-Fi network, but your computer (or other device) doesn't have Wi-Fi capability, you can plug an ethernet cable from the computer into this unit.  Your computer will communicate with the client, the client will connect to the Wi-Fi network, and you will have wireless access to the internet.<br /><br />My computer doesn't have Wi-Fi capability.  To connect to the network via Wi-Fi, I use this product as a client.  Cool.  Now, I can use the printer that's connected to the network.  As a client, it works great.  I haven't had any problems with dropped connections or anything.<br /><br />OVERALL IMPRESSION<br /><br />I am amazed at how far technology has come.  This little unit is just a little bigger than the average wall AC adapter, yet it can do that the big box routers can.  It's portable, easy to set up, easy to use.  I plan to bring it with me on all my vacations.  I really and truly love this little thing.<br /><br />This product was provided for review by LowerPriceUSA., easy to use.

No bulky adapter to carry - plug it right to the wall to recharge.<br />- LOVE that it offers 2 USB charging ports. This lets me leave behind 2 USB wall adapters as well.<br />- LOVE that you can have 2 USB devices charging on it while it's plugged into the wall and recharging itself.<br />- LOVE that it can act as a router.

I'll start with the bad part.<br /><br />The left-click mechanism inserts bonus clicks for me.  This may sound harmless, but in a situation where you need a single-click and can't afford a double-click, this means the mouse is near useless.  An application I have initiates a sequence (drawing) with a 1st click, and it terminates the sequence with an end click.  Obviously, an double-click back-to-back prevents this from happening. Other software of mine recognizes double-clicks as a request for context-help or for modifying whatever was clicked, and thus a menu pops up that requires disposal.  This KILLS productivity.<br /><br />I have a &#34;day&#34; job, and thus use the mouse sparingly at night, so this shouldn't be a case of excessive wear, but after three years of ownership, I've had to relegate this to being a fancy blue-tooth remote for advancing PowerPoint slides.  In the meantime, I'm searching for a solution:  do I buy another, thinking this is anomalous, or do I move on to another manufacturer?  The question is tougher than one might think.  In my research, I'm finding that MANY users of this mouse have the same problem.  Web searches show this, and users report that the issue is either a build-up of static electricity or the wearing-down of the click assembly.  The solution for the former was to &#34;blow&#34; into the mouse (FAIL), and the latter requires tiny fingers to disassemble and either replace or bend an over-flexed piece of copper(?).<br /><br />My e-mail to Logi tech support went un-answered.  I'll try them again, hoping they don't lose the support request again.<br /><br />As for &#34;pros&#34;...the mouse feels great under hand.  If you've never used a trackball, they take a few uses to adjust to, but I'm talking just a small amount of time, and then you can't imagine returning to a traditional mouse or track-pad (even worse).  You can hold this on your lap,in the air, against your chest --- anywhere, and not be tethered, forced to use a mouse-pad, or be constantly picking up the mouse and returning it to a central location.<br /><br />The wheel is smooth, the bluetooth connectivity is near instant, and it's gorgeous.<br /><br />If only mine didn't hyper-click.",

I have looked everywhere for an adapter of some sort, but have not been successful in finding one. This mini disc is even smaller than the center hole on the vertical drive.  There is no place for it to lock into. There is no denying this is a good deal, I am thinking that many folks  are going to be disappointed. Since I cannot play the disc, I cannot honestly review its content.   Update: Seller confirmed it will not play in a vertical drive.

I first bought this for my Dad and quickly discovered that his vertical floppy drive could not play the disc that comes with this product. So I ordered him an external floppy drive that would play it.  Meanwhile I ordered another one (It is only $5) and waited for delivery.  I figured I would practice on my computer before I took new drive over to my Dad's.  This product comes with NO directions of any kind.  Insertion of disc causes NOTHING to happen.

I was able to get it to pick up my Linksys WRT54G2 no problem by using a Windows XP machine to do the setup. The machine requiring the expander is a box running OpenSolaris with a Linksys WMP55AG card. Before I put in the range expander (which I set on my desk, directly by the OpenSolaris machine), I was getting, if lucky, a signal of 2-3 from my router across the house, and I got frequent disconnections (especially annoying if you're running a VPN connection like I am). With the expander, I get a signal of 14-15 that never varies, and I've had no drops of my connection, either. I've been using it for the past two weeks with absolutely no problems whatsoever.

This isn't one.<br /><br />I got this state of the art keyboard about a year and a half ago, and I love every second using it... when it worked (or should I say, &#34;when *they* worked&#34;).<br />A little bit of a back story, I'm a programmer and I use this keyboard for work. So if you're looking for their synapse driver's review, you won't get it here. I don't use any drivers.<br /><br />Saving the best for last, I'll start with the reason why I decided to write this review.<br />As some other customers have mentioned, these keyboards break. In my case, it happened twice.<br /><br />First time was around 5 months after I got it. Since I type for a living, it became very annoying really fast when the C-key decided to stop responding one day.<br />I contacted Razer Customer Support right away, and they were great about responding to you within 24 hours, when they're just guiding you through the troubleshooting steps. When it comes to issuing you an RMA, however, it took them several days to get it to me (with several reminder emails from my end). I sent the keyboard back right away, and a few later, there comes my new shiny keyboard! Joyful day!<br /><br />The second time happens a few days ago, which was less than a year after I got my replacement keyboard. This time the keyboard went on a seizure, and wouldn't send any signals to my machine!<br />Again, I contacted Razer Customer Support, and again, they responded within 24 hours. Of course, they, again, told me to go through the troubleshooting steps. This time, however, they couldn't issue me an RMA, because it has been more than a year since my original purchase. So.. no new shiny keyboard for me this time.<br /><br />So, the reason why I decided to write this review a year and a half after my purchase, was because when I decided to spend a lot of money on this keyboard, I was hoping for a durable keyboard that I could use at work forever (or at least until I get to use 50 million key-strokes on my Cherry MX Blue switches like they advertised it). So if you're someone who's also hoping for that durable keyboard, I want to make sure to tell you:<br /><br />  &#34;Look for another product. I've tried two of these, and both of them last for less than a year.&#34;<br /><br />And now.... Here comes the good part!<br /><br />As I mentioned, this keyboard is a state of the art keyboard. It looked very slick, the back light's intensity was adjustable to my comfort, it included 1 USB port, a microphone jack as well as a headphones jack for my convenience right there on the keyboard!<br />The cable was really long, so whenever I wanted to sit back with this really beefy keyboard on my lap, I could do just that!<br /><br />A few people have come to me and asked me if the back light bothered me at all. In all honesty, it didn't.<br />I know this is subjective, but as a programmer, I need to type a lot of symbols, and having them light up on my face really helped me find those symbols with so much ease, even in dark rooms.<br /><br />Did I mention, this keyboard was beefy? Well, I'm telling you it was! And I loved it!<br />I put it on my desk, and I could type without ever looking, because I knew my keyboard wouldn't move or slide like one of those flabby keyboards.<br /><br />Last but most importantly, Cherry MX Blue switches... Mm hmm!<br />Anybody who uses keyboard extendedly should really consider using one of these. You'd type for days without feeling it. You might actually enjoy your typing experience better! And you might not even notice it, but you'd actually type faster once you get used to these switches. The tactile response was so amazing.<br />It's unfortunate that you won't use all 50 million key strokes that these switches can handle on this keyboard, because it will stop functioning before you even get close to a million!<br /><br />It has been a really great fun using Razer BlackWidow Ultimate!<br />Now it's time for a DAS. Hopefully, I can actually use 50 million keystrokes!",

            "input": "The following review is what I also posted for the UAP-PRO model, but is entirely applicable to the regular UAP. The main difference between the UAP-PRO and the UAP is that the PRO comes with a second radio (5Ghz band) and can handle more users per device when evenly distributed between the two radios. In addition to this the PRO works with standard 48v PoE and has two gigabit ethernet ports (instead of a single 100Mbit).<br /><br />I've been reading everything I can about wireless access points and the various manufacturers over the past couple of months as I needed to upgrade our wireless network in the office.<br /><br />Prior to this we were making do with a couple of residential wireless routers, which individually were top of their line (when purchased), but when trying to support a network of business users the residential routers really started to buckle under the pressure as more and more devices came online.<br /><br />Generally with any wireless access point you can expect to cope with around 20-ish users before the quality of service drops below useable levels. The exact number depends on so many variables and concessions that it's not feasible to give hard and fast numbers. But be aware that even if a access point says it can handle 500 connections at once, it's very unlikely that those devices will get usable throughput if they're doing any more than idling.<br /><br />With our residential routers it was difficult to do the following:<br /><br />- Monitor quality of signal<br />- Monitor number of users using wifi<br />- Monitor number of users per access point<br />- Configure access points / upgrade software<br /><br />All of the above have now been resolved for me by deploying a pair of UAP-PRO access points. The Ubiquiti free central control software allows me to have instant visibility into the state of my wireless network, how many users are connected, what their signal strength looks like, what their capabilities are, and to which access pointsthey are connected.<br /><br />In general I'm extremely happy with the quality of the network I've been able to assemble with the UAP-PRO devices for less than the price of a single true enterprise access point (not even considering the price that we'd need to spend on a controller, too).<br /><br />I do have a few criticisms of the UAP-PRO / Ubiquiti Unifi networking product, however:<br /><br />- The controller software, while great, can be a little funky to navigate and find the settings you want to change.<br /><br />- Just about any change to do with the radios, SSIDs, and wireless network can immediately cause all access points to restart to reconfigure, without any sort of prompt to warn you it's about to happen. It makes fiddling with the controller software a little hazardous during the working day. Now, I know this should be configured in a lab environment ahead of time, but measuring the quality of the network when under load and tweaking the settings to experiment is difficult to simulate in a small office environment.<br /><br />- The Zero-Handoff functionality (still in beta, using 3.1.9 here) worked ok for us, but at the cost of a much less reliable connection. I'm not going to 100% blame the hardware as we have a lot of interference in our office space, and when running zero-handoff all access points have to run on the same channel so were likely interfering with each other as well as the neighboring noise. ZH was nice to balance the load on the access points, as without it you're left to the devices picking an AP and roaming when the feel like it, which can leave more devices than desired connected to the first access point they see when entering the building.<br /><br />Aside from the above I'm having a few issues with odd spikes of noise / loss of signal, but I'm going to blame this on interference within our environment and not on these devices.<br /><br />Despite the problems mentioned above I'm happy with this product and think it provides great value for money. If you need more robust stats, more robust controls, and more enterprise management features, then you may want to look elsewhere, but you will pay a LOT more for those features.",

My old headset, the Sennheiser PC151, had great sound but hurt my ears after extended use.  So after researching nice usb headsets that would let me power my desktop speakers again, I settled on the Razer Megladon headset.<br /><br />Now, I would like to preface that I did not expect the audio experience with this headset to exceed or even meet that of the Sennheiser.  Running audio through USB in general will produce a subpar experience compared to traditional analog, but this was a special circumstance and reviews of the headset convinced me to take the plunge.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.) First of all, this headset is very comfortable.  I had a 5 hour session using these one night, and beyond my ears getting a little warm, there was no discomfort.<br />2.) The packaging and carrying case that come with this case are also very nice.<br />3.) The fit and finish of this product is very attractive.  I appreciate the slightly more toned down looked compared to some of the gaudy alternatives.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.) This isn't so much a con as a warning, but when you try and use these in Skype or other VOIP software, make sure to check your mic level.  There is a control module &#34;puck&#34; in line with the cable that will handle treble, bass, mic levels, as well as switch between 2.1 and surround.  I would recommend setting your mic level on the control module to around 2-4 bars.  You also need to go into Windows and change the mic levels from the default of 100 to anywhere between 15 and 30.  If you do not, those on the other end of your call will get intermittent LOUD noise.<br />2.) The virtual 7.1 surround.  I, admittedly, have never tried a 5.1/7.1 headset before.  But for me, the experience with this headset was awful.  Other reviews have suggested that you make sure the game you are using the headset with support 7.1. So after some research, I installed a few of the games I own that support 7.1.  Each and every game was as bad as the last.  The only effect turning on the 7.1 produced was an underwater or echo effect.<br />3.) The in general sound quality of this headset was disappointing.  I went through not only my game library, but quite a few songs to get a better sense of the sound profile. It wasn't bad by any means, but I guess I have been spoiled by the sound card I have been using.  Even after playing around with the levels in the control module, It sounded quite tinny to me.<br /><br />I ended up returning this headset.  Try as much as I could, I just couldn't get used to the virtual surround or the sound quality of the stereo.  I am giving this a 2 star rating because I do not think the price is anywhere close to the quality of audio it would suggest.  For the same price, I could get a cheaper analog headset and a decent soundcard for much better sound.  I have switched to a DAC for powering my desktop speakers and put off replacing my headset for now.  If you are looking for a nice headset, I would recommend skipping USB and finding a nice analog set instead.",

            "input": "I use my home desktop PC mainly for web browsing, TV shows, and games, and I was itching to upgrade my 22\\\\\" Samsung 2233bw TN monitor.  I wanted a monitor slightly larger than my old one, with great contrast and colors, (though I'm no graphic designer, so I didn't need perfect color accuracy), good viewing angles, and a decent response time. I wanted the great contrast because I like to play games with the lights off and be fully immersed with my 5.1 surround setup, and darker games like Dead Space just never looked quite right.  With respect to motion blur, I don't tend to notice it too readily, so I wasn't terribly concerned about response times, as long as reviews said the blur wasn't distracting.<br /><br />To give you a comparison to this monitor (if you're impatient, skip to the next paragraph), before picking up the BenQ EW2420, I purchased the LG IPS236V 23\\\\\" IPS 1920x1080 monitor.  Now, I had to exchange for a different IPS236V about four times to get one without horrible backlight bleed, but once I found one, it was a great monitor.  It had excellent viewing angles with virtually no color shift (better viewing angles than the EW2420), no readily noticeable motion blur (less blur than the EW2420 has), and great natural-looking colors.  The issues were that it lacked any contrast benefit over my old 2233bw, the size difference over 22\\\\\" 16:10 wasn't a big deal, and a distracting grey or purple-ish \\\\\"IPS glow\\\\\" could be seen in the bottom corners in dark scenes with the lights off.  So, after a few weeks, I returned this monitor, continued the hunt for my upgrade, and bought the EW2420.<br /><br />I've only had this monitor for less than a week now, but I'm loving it.  The size is a great upgrade, it feels very sturdy (The IPS236V was very light and I could flex the screen and cause backlight bleed with just slight pressure), and the colors look great after calibration (settings are brightness: 30, contrast: 50, sharpness: 2, gamma: 2, red: 100, green: 94, blue: 80 (SEE EDIT BELOW)).  While there is some off-angle gamma shift, which means the borders of the screen don't look as black as the center, this is barely noticeable with my settings and is not a distraction.  Blacks look great, and dark games like Dead Space 2 feel so immersive now.  The contrast starts to drop if you move your head more than a few inches to the side, but I rarely look at the monitor from an angle, so this doesn't bother me.  It sits at a great height for my desktop and the stand is compact and doesn't protrude much from the face of the screen.<br /><br />One down side is that I noticed ghosting on this monitor pretty much right away. It seemed transitions between dark colors ghosted the worst, and this was confirmed by looking at the response time test in the monitor test images at [...] where the top four squares were the darkest (the bottom four were not able to be seen and showed virtually no ghosting).  Because of the slower response time, at times I can notice ghosting in some scenes in games and movies, but it's not distracting or disorienting, and I can live with this for the great colors and black levels this monitor has.  I'm sure photographers and such would find flaws with the colors of this monitor, but to me it looks wonderful, and the colors really pop (probably partially because it has a semi-gloss coating instead of matte).<br /><br />While I have to bump a star off my review for the ghosting times of this monitor, I'm positive this is one of the best monitors I could have to suit my needs.  I always had a \\\\\"do I really need this?\\\\\" feeling when I had the IPS236V, but with this monitor, that feeling is gone and replaced by an unhealthy need to get home and play with my new toy!<br /><br />EDIT:  I've gone to the color settings labeled \\\\\"normal\\\\\" (rgb 88, 81, 82) after noticing some color and gradient banding issues with my first settings.  It seems any movement away from these default color and contrast settings introduces banding to thegrey-scale gradient.  Seems maybe the BenQ guys calibrated this one right? I don't know, but for now I'm sticking with these settings, as they look good!",

The Netflix app runs and will connect to the show I want to watch. Then the video and audio will play at most a few seconds and then pauses for a varying amount of time, between a few seconds to longer than a minute. When the app is actually streaming for a few seconds, the audio is choppy and unbearable to listen to. While this is going on I got on the laptop and connected to Netflix and it worked fine so it is not an internet problem.<br /><br />2. The browser is slow. If I swipe to scroll I must wait 5-10 seconds before the page scrolls. If I do several things at once it will wait awhile then do all these things at once resulting in an unpredictable result so I only do one thing at a time and wait.<br /><br />3. It loses connectivity to the WiFi. I am sitting about 3 feet from the router but I have to keep switching between my networks to stay connected.<br /><br />4. I can't load a Windows 7 USB driver for it to transfer files from my laptop to the tablet. The secondary reason for purchasing the unit was to play MP3 files with it. I cannot transfer a single song from the laptop to the tablet. It does read my 64G flash drive which contains music. However while that is plugged in I see no way to power the unit and the battery life time seems to be too short for my purpose of listening to music for an extended time.<br /><br />5. When I went to 1.FM to download their app the browser was directed to the Apple store. I typed the URL for Google Play and selected the app for download however the site downloaded the app to my Android phone instead. So obviously the tablet is not recognized as a valid Android device.<br /><br />6. It keeps warning me that the SD card is running out of space. I went into settings and it won't say how much space is free.<br /><br />They wrote back that my unit was defective and then proceeded to tell me how to copy files to the table. The USB option in settings that they referred to didn't exist and what they told me to do in Windows couldn't be done because, as I told them, there was no driver installed for the tablet.

That's where this tablet comes in. Even though its the intel atom version, it can handle my 1080p mkv movies really well. The file size of my movies can reach 12GB per movie, so I can say this tablet is fast. Blu-ray quality, DTS sound and all.<br /><br />Screen is really important to me. I've noticed the screen has small flickering when the tablet arrives. You really have to see it to notice. I thought the tablet was defective, but turned out its the windows setting. Did a quick google search and I found out how to fix it. Just right click at the desktop, select 'Screen Resolution', then Advanced Settings, Intel(r) HD Graphic, Graphic Properties, Power and turn off  'Panel Self Refresh'. Then its perfect. I don't know how it got past quality control.<br /><br />Tablet is great, but on the other hand, Windows 8.1 really takes time to get used to. I've been a windows user for more than 15 years, and I can say that 8.1 is the worst version in terms of user-friendliness and easy of use.

Setup is extremely easy. I did not use the cd that came with the router, I just connected the router via ethernet and the menu screen to setup the connection popped up with step-by-step directions. In less than sixty seconds I was connected to the wireless.   2. Was able to connect to the router menu screen using 192.168.1.1 using default U/P  admin/admin and then made my customizations from there.   3. I tested the wireless connectivity inside and outside the house. On my deck outside the house the router was down to three bars (out of five) and the same in other rooms inside the house. My other router was maintaining between four and five bars from the same locations. (Note my other router cost three times as much.) I can see why some people mention degraded performance in larger homes.   4. In terms of speed, I notice a slight speed increase as compared to the D-Link I was using previously.   5.

In fact, I just counted: I have more desktops, laptops and tablets than I have fingers...<br /><br />And I just bought another one.<br /><br />Why? Was it pure unbridled techlust (again) rearing it's ugly head? No. It was because the device I purchased is a breakthrough piece of tech, and a computer I never knew I needed... until I had it in my hands.<br /><br />It's the 32GB Dell Venue 8 Pro, a Windows 8.1 tablet that is not just a tablet... it's a full Win 8 computer, with access to the desktop and ability to install and run any legacy Windows apps. It's very much like an iPad mini, but with the added value of being able to access the file system and Microsoft Office. I'm mighty impressed.<br /><br />So impressed, I'm actually writing up this review. I'm not a &#34;tech review&#34; kind of writer, so when I spend the time to do something like this... it matters.<br /><br />The device is easy to use in the Win 8 &#34;modern&#34; mode, the flat design that Microsoft did long before Jony Ive thought about doing the same for IOS... and surprisingly easy too use in the traditional Windows desktop mode. It's got a great screen, good speaker, over eight hours of battery life, and with the Windows Store featuring (most) of the apps that I am used to using on the iPad it's allowed me to pass my third gen iPad down to one of my sons.<br /><br />Dell (a company I am NOT a fan of, by the way) may have done something I never thought possible... they may have created an iPad killer. Yes, that is pretty high-grade hyperbole, but the more you think about it, the more the possibility rings true. Dell certainly believes they have something special, because they are spending a lot of marketing money promoting the device on TV and print. They are proud of the device, and justifiably so... it's a fast, well designedpiece of hardware that works as a replacement laptop with the addition of a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />While I am a fan of Apple's products, I think they are making some mistakes of late, and their emphasis on high profit margins rather than the customer is one of the biggest ones. There is NO REASON for most of their products to be priced as high as they are, and that leaves an opening for competitors like Dell and Google to come in and take potential sales away from them. The Venue 8 Pro is $299, and when you throw in a 64GB storage card for ~$45, you get a device that can serve as a true laptop replacement for most people.<br /><br />Apple needs to watch out, because I used to be a fanboy for their products... and yet, Dell just got $300 from me. That is something that could be considered a &#34;teachable moment.&#34;",

The battery life is awesome! 6.5 hours of continuous heavy use only used up 65% of my battery!   2. You get the real web, flash actually plays remarkably well. You can just play videos straight on youtube, are able to click links in them etc. Not a huge fan of flash, but it is everywhere!   3. If you are familiar with webOS, the operating system on the TouchPad, you know how awesome the mutli-tasking is, widely held to be best mobile interface in that regards, and it really shines on this beautiful large screen.   4. As a retailer rep at a big electronic store commented after I showed \\\\\"it does so much for you\\\\\" and unlike his phone/pad on the TouchPad you dont have to figure out which app to use, go find it, launch it, & then start typing, on here you just start typing what you are thinking then choose the app to finish it with in an easy list (email, fb, twitter, memo, calendar, and the list goes on!).  5. Although it does have a limited number of apps compared to the tablet market leader, it has many of the important ones, and most are outstanding quality with very few ads to be seen! The main thing to remember is you dont need an app for a whole lot of things, you have the real web just like on a computer! Imagine if you had to go find app for each website you wanted to visit on your computer, nuts right? This works like your computer, apps when you want them, the real web the rest of the time.  6. Your accounts are tied right into the tablet, and you can access everything from one place... You can chat on google, skype, aim, yahoo, etc. (even sms with a new HP webOS phone) all from the same place built right into the messaging app. Email is the same way & is the best email interface I have ever seen, and I am excited to have it on my computer next year when HP starts putting webOS on every PC they sell (some time of window you can run webOS apps inmost likely).  7. Love video skyping on this!  8. Could it have a rear camera, sure, doubt I would use it much (thats what my smartphone &/ camera is for) especially if it is a poor quality camera like the leading device.   9. I could go on and on (so could my wife who is trying hard to win one currently for herself, and my kids who are jn love with coloring games, air hockey, and of course ANGRY BIRDS HD!) If you are wanting to get a tablet, start here, if you dont like it, return & switch to another platform, but this is one you really need to try for a bit!    -- Sent from my HP TouchPad",

These features defined my choice to buy Vizio CN15. It possesses brilliant screen, it is fast and it packed in the rigorous aluminium case.<br /><br />The design of the laptop is probably not for everyone but minimalists will be happy with it. It is thin as for regular not \\\\\"ultra\\\\\" laptop. It has only two USB ports and no CD-DVD drive is installed. It feels cold and tough with the minimum lights - just one very \\\\\"Apple\\\\\" like in the center underneath keyboard - and no any tuners or switchers of any kind except for power button. Sharp keyboard ages can be rough on your wrists depending on your \\\\\"typing style\\\\\". The lid is hard to open which in some cases is not as bad as it sounds. At least, I know that my little child who likes to play with the buttons when I'm away will not be able to open this laptop.<br /><br />It works quietly and does not hit up if you use MS Office applications or any other specialized software. However it will hit if you use it to play games with the demanding 3D graphics.<br /><br />The WiFi covers decent area but driver is outdated so it drops connection every 10-15 min. It will end and never come back once you replace driver for the newer version which is easy to find on the Vizio site. The detailed instructions for the installation was posted in the some earlier review.<br /><br />The keyboard is an average quality and missing \\\\\"up\\\\\" \\\\\"down\\\\\" keys does not make it better. The track-pad is not that bad but I noticed that it does not work properly when receiver for wireless mouse is in USB port. So if you use wireless mouse it is better to switch off track-pad. You can elso choose option to switch it off automatically when wireless mouse is in use (via control panel). Not important for me but back-light is absent. Wonder why?<br /><br />I'm disappointed with the power supply for this model. It is heavy and big as a brick. Power supply for my 7 years old \\\\\"Toshiba satellite\\\\\" is actually much lighter and smaller. On the other side buttery life is not as short as it was pointed out in some other reviews. Battery last for 4-5 hours if you decrease brightness of the screen a bit. It is initially really bright and even will hurt eyes if used with the full brightness in the relatively dark room. It is not 7 hours, of course, but this laptop utilizes regular hard drive and power-consuming processor. Honestly, I can give up some battery life for the good performance and this model really has it.<br /><br />Web camera is an average quality.<br /><br />Sound through the speakers are not that good but audio-chip is good itself so with the headphones sound is decent.<br /><br />I gave this model four stars mainly because of the large power supply and missing keys on the keyboard.<br /><br />I tried to be very critical but I have to say that overall quality and performance of this laptop is very good for the price you'll pay. I would recommend it to the friend.",

Honestly, as I use this drive for storage only (OS on another HDD), I am quite pleased with its performance.  It is fast enough to read/write my data and hasn't had a problem since I purchased it (keep in mind, WD only warranties this drive for 2yrs and I've had it running for nearly 4yrs withoutt a hiccup).<br /><br />I certainly would not recommend this as your primary drive - as it is too slow and current SSDs (or even the Black version) will make your computer purr along at a much better pace.  If, however, you are looking for affordable, dependable storage, you can't really go wrong with WD's Blue line.  The buffer may be smaller, the warranty may be shorter, and the performance may be their lowest - but one can't argue reliability.

I bought mine at Best Buy, and paid way more than the price listed here, but I am extrememly happy with my purchase regardless.

I hunted around long and eventually decided to follow the one piece of advice to reformat the drive.  Fearing that I'd only make my life more miserable, I had been quite hesitant to do this.    In the end, however, reformatting was the right move.  Once done, the unit responded as advertised, although the Geni Backup Assistant software that came with it has never worked (doesn't recognize the share -- a trial version of Genie Home worked, FYI).  I'm able to use the normal Vista Backup and the Intego Backup (free Mac version of Geni software) without problems, although the Intego wants to create \\\\\"hardlinks\\\\\" (which I don't understand) and kicks a nonfatal warning when it can't.  Intego does work, though.    So far, so good, and I'd recommend that if you have any problems with transfer rates to try reformatting and see if it helps.  Make sure you're not losing any data, which should be the case for a new drive.  If this doesn't work, call LaCie.  Good luck.",

            "input": "I bought my first Kindle a couple of years ago now. It was the Kindle Keyboard (i.e. the third Kindle release) and I had gotten it because I felt like the Kindle folks had finally hit their stride. The color was immediately attractive to me, the form factor and weight overall was ideal for one handed reading, and the speed was reasonable enough to where the black flashes on the screen didn't bug me. That being said, I almost never used the keyboard, navigating the screen on the directional pad was a chore, and I needed a $60 case in order to read in dim lighting in an elegant way (the first party lighted leather case). Last winter I jumped on the Kindle Touch bandwagon for one primary reason: the infared touch screen. The idea of not having to use that stupid d-pad was very enticing. Additionally, there was X-ray (which sideloads Wikipedia content for characters, places, and terms in books and tells you where in the book they're mentioned), a greatly improved case (the old case had a serious issue with the connection to the spine), and a page refresh that didn't require blacking out the screen each time. Of course, the case was still $60 in order to read in dim lighting and the smooth leather case attracted scratches like a magnet. All-in-all, this was an evolutionary step forward that I only took because of how much more I loved the Kindle than practically any other device I owned.<br /><br />Flash forward to two and a half weeks ago when I got my Kindle Paperwhite: there's no doubt that this is superior in nearly every way to every single Kindle ever made and now is the time to jump on the e-Reader bandwagon if you've been holding out. I'm very confident that if you enjoy reading or if you're like me and enjoy reading except when it means squinting for tiny text or lugging around heavy books, you will not regret getting a Paperwhite. I'll start out talking about the new features and what I like about it before I get to some of the areas for improvement.<br /><br />With each Kindle, the team has gotten better at making the onboarding experience as pain-free as possible. The Paperwhite was no exception. While I do slightly miss the fact that in the past my Kindle already had my account information on it (could be that for some unknown reason mine didn't while others did), the onscreen tutorial as soon as you switch it on is awesome. You're ready to start using it within a couple of minutes as long as you have connectivity (WiFi or 3G if you got the 3G model). One key difference on the onboarding experience this time is that they no longer make you suffer as an existing customer - getting your content on there is much easier. They've changed the UI to be more like the Amazon MP3 Player UI (and I think even the Kindle UI on non-Kindles) where you have \\\\\"Cloud\\\\\" section and  a \\\\\"Device\\\\\" section with the major improvement of a drop down for type of content (Periodical, Book, etc). So now, you just scroll through your cloud content and tap the stuff you want to transfer over to your device. Since the Kindle Touch, any personal documents you've transferred to your device through Amazon is backed up in the cloud up to a reasonably high limit (books you buy through Amazon are backed up without limit). So I had over 100 items to transfer over, but because the Paperwhite is a bit zippier than past Kindles I was able to tap all the items I cared about (probably 3/4 of my library) in under 5 minutes, and over WiFi it was short work to get them all on there (notes, bookmarks, and all). What's even better though is that you can now sync your collections, as well! Once you've downloaded the content, you can sync that metadata and it'll organize all your content within seconds into their old collections. Cool, huh?<br /><br />Enough gushing about onboarding, let's move on to the UI. I like it, I like it a lot. Instead of the boring lists of text approach of the Kindle Touch that carried over from the pedigree of Kindles lacking a touch interface, there's now more of a cover flow-like interface that uses the covers of purchased books or the first page of personal documents sent via \\\\\"Sent to Kindle\\\\\" (otherwise just some text in a box). It fits 6 covers on a page and it totally looks more polished to have this. You still get X-ray as in Kindles past, so nothing surprising there, and you still tap 3/4 of the right side of the screen to go forward (or swipe right to left), 1/4 of left side of screen to go back (or swipe left to right), and top 1/5th of screen for menu (including the home icon). However, there are three new features that are wonderful. The first is the time left in your chapter or book. It's actually quite accurate. If you vary the pace you read at or linger too much on pages caught up in daydreams then maybe it's not so good for you, but it seems to be adaptive. So if you start reading something slowly and then speed up a bunch, it will adjust, I've noticed. I'm still not sure if it's per book or per device, but I do know that information isn't stored in the cloud or anything - that math is done on the device itself and if you were to wipe the device it'd go back to defaults. The sacrifice is that you have to hit the menu area at the top to get to the page number, but if you tap the lower left corner it cycles between time left in chapter, time left in book, and Kindle proprietary location. The second main change is the addition of more fonts - I was taken aback at how cool this is. For certain books certain fonts really pop - I'm reading The Princess Bride right now, primarily, and using Futura makes it feel so much more like a real book to me. As advertised, you can go one font size smaller than before, which I don't ever use but it's just as sharp as you'd expect even at that size. Oh, and of course the physical home button is gone. I thought I'd miss this but I surprisingly enough do not at all. The last major change is in the upper right corner of the navigation screens - you can not only change how you sort but how you filter (collections, novels, periodicals, etc), which is a small detail but very nice to have.<br /><br />Getting down to the screen itself, there are some real revolutionary changes here. First of all, it's capacitive touch. I thought this would never be possible and I could be totally wrong but I haven't heard of another e-reader pulling this off. The Kindle Touch IR touch screen was fine but took some getting used to and meant that objects other than your hands like maybe a piece of cloth from your blanket falling on the screen would turn pages. Now, much like your smartphone it requires your finger specifically to turn pages (or a sausage, but if you're reading with raw meats in your hand then you're an odd duck). Secondly, the lighting technology is phenomenal. While it's true that you can't see the light coming out of one side of the device like you can on the latest generation Nook, you can see around all the edges the slightest hint of the layer of light under the screen if you turn it at the exact right angle. Plus, at the bottom you see the tiniest bit of fading under dark conditions. Other than that, it's stunning. Everyone that I've shown it to has been equally impressed. Even better: even at its lowest brightness (which you control very easily via the top menu from any context on the device you're in), it's a good bit whiter than the Kindle Touch was. For the first time ever, I really at times felt like I was reading a paper back book in high definition. In the past the e-ink has always impressed and been super easy on my eyes, but the grayish brown background always made it feel like an e-reader, which wasn't a big deal to me. However, it's a very nice touch that you'll almost immediately appreciate. I like how under well-lit situations, keeping the light somewhere in the middle just improves the contrast and feels nice on my eyes, and turning it up to the max it doesn't even seem like it's backlit at all, just even prettier than before. In darker situations, I can turn it down to the lower half of the lighting spectrum and read without issue or eye irritation versus a bright white screen. I've only done this for 20 minute bouts because reading in the dark a ton isn't great for you, but if your lamp just isn't that bright, the Paperwhite has got your back. One other thing you may notice in my photos is the contrast improvement. It's subtle, but it's there. I couldn't really tell between the Kindle Keyboard and the Kindle Touch, but I totally can now. Don't get me wrong, it's not a life-changing improvement, but within an hour or so of reading on my Paperwhite I could feel in my eyes that something was just different other than the whiter background, and on super close inspection realized it was the addition of more pixels.<br /><br />A recurring issue for me in the past was the case - so how does this one stack up? This is the first [[ASIN:B007R5YFS4 Kindle case]] where I'd give a five star rating. It's outstanding and a great value at $40. I loved that they brought back the textured leather - it doesn't scratch up and it grips so much better in my hands. The magnetic clasp is an inspired touch. It may have been inspired by Apple, but I'll take it. It's the perfect balance between the Kindle Keyboard strap and the Kindle Touch free-balling look. When held in funky positions or dropped it doesn't fly open, but it takes very little exertion to get it open. The best part for dorks out there like me is the auto on/off thing. I thought it was just a gimmick when I heard about it, but having used it for a couple of weeks now I'm just blown away by how much it enhances my experience. I can literally read a little bit while waiting on an elevator for a second because it turns on so quickly and I love that I can shut it without being worried about hitting the physical home button the Kindle Touch had or even the IR screen itself because I know there is no physical button and that it'll turn off immediately. I like that the inside of the front cover has a nice texture to it that looks really polished and that the side, top, and bottom are a little rubbery to absorb shock better. Just as before, the Paperwhite fits so snug that you'll never have to worry about it falling out of the case or getting damaged because of how solid the shell is.<br /><br />So as I alluded to earlier, I do have a couple of minor gripes. I'm bummed that they did away with the swipe up and swipe down gestures. Formerly, these gestures let you skip chapters and I loved it. I'm probably going to write in to the Kindle folks and beg them to bring back this feature. I don't know why it went away. Speaking of cut features,  why can't I toggle WiFi on/off from the top menu? I have to go to settings now to switch airplane mode on/off. That makes it harder to conserve battery life because of the added work so I'll probably sync less often. One other lost feature: text-to-speech. They cut the speakers and headphone jack out very quietly (coincidentally), so you'll have to opt for the cheap Kindle model if you're visually impaired, which probably makes more sense. I'm not a fan of the black color. My favorite Kindle color is still the graphite from the Kindle Keyboard. It's nice that the back is more rubbery than the smooth Kindle Touch back, but the bezel being black means that it retains your hand grease more easily (the screen itself doesn't seem to, mainly just the bezel). The fact that the home screen has a bottom row dedicated to recommendations and hot titles is kind of cool, but I wish it was opt-out. I'd prefer to use the screen real estate for more collections. Plus, it doesn't even exclude books I've already bought, which is disappointing; hopefully that'll get fixed later. Speaking of ads, the ad-supported device only saves you $20 and requires a swipe-to-unlock (because of the new case, I'm guessing). I think going ad-supported is silly now because of this - it was a lot moresensible in past Kindles.  One last gripe: the Paperwhite still isn't lighter. I'm guessing they compromised here in favor of the battery life. With the case on, it actually does feel a little easier to hold in one hand than the Kindle Touch, but still not quite as nice as the Kindle Keyboard.<br /><br />A couple of last notes: the jury is still out for me on battery life. It's doing pretty well overall, but after decent usage for a week and some change the battery is at maybe 70%. So I don't think it'll hold up to the two months I was promised (even with WiFi off), but I think it'll easily meet at least the month that my old Kindle had even with the lighted screen, and I'm perfectly satisfied with that. It's slightly zippier overall than the Kindle Touch. Page turns are a little faster and the black screen flashes are so quick that you really barely even notice them. Web browsing is a little better, too, but still nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Ok, I think I've said enough here - as a whole, I hope I've given you a pretty good idea of what the Kindle Paperwhite is like. If you own a Kindle 1 or 2, you need to upgrade to this. Even if you have the Kindle Keyboard and Kindle Touch, I'd say this is a nice upgrade but probably more valuable for the Kindle Keyboard users. Personally, I don't at all regret my upgrade from the Kindle Touch. I really feel like it was much more sensible than my upgrade from the Kindle Keyboard.

That frugality was short lived, the HP didn't make to its third birthday, and once again I was lusting for a Macbook.  This time I went for it.  I've only had the computer for a few days, so probably no genius insights and a  lot of my initial observations have been said before, but I'll proceed anyway.  First, and most obvious, straight out of the box it's...pretty.  I mean seriously this is one darned nice looking piece of technology--nothing clunky here.  Okay, like others have said, straight out of the box, it was easy to set up and worked like a charm.  Because I have no Mac experience I figured I'd be on the phone with Applecare pretty quick, but the only assistance I needed was from my Internet service provider, to remind me what my wireless password is.  After that I was good to go.  Shocking!  Not a single other glitch.  As far as learning curve from Windows to Mac, it's going fairly well.  Key board shortcuts are fairly intuitive--command instead of control, Finder instead of \\\\\"My Computer\\\\\" (I think that's right). The screen and back lighting are amazing.  BTW: I have had to call Apple support and they've been very helpful, and reasonably pleasant.   Also, so far, I haven't spoken to anyone in Asia.      The only negatives I've noticed, is that there's an awful lot of real estate between the edge of the computer and the key board. I'm sure there's some ergonomic plus to this; but, for me, it's just  annoying.  Course, I may just need a lower typing surface (dining room table is supposedly for eating? Who knew?)  Also, for the cost of the computer I wish a mouse had been included, even an inexpensive usb connected one.  Still, Best Buy opened at nine, and the magic mouse was on sale, so not so bad.",

While it's a leap into next gen computers, the touch pad was not ready for this laptop. It's glitchy at times and takes getting use to, but once you figure it out then it's not a problem. Windows 8. Again, just need time to adjust but it seems like Windows 8 would make more sense on a system with touch interface. Until I get better acquainted with it, I'm using the desktop mode.",

If you have a firewall you may need to setup your software to allow the adapter to access the internet(basic setting for a firewall).    The unit is small, does not have any special switches or antennas so you can really fit it anywhere.     I am very happy with my Vonage service. The $25 unlimited plan is cheaper than my broadband provider's plan and it won't increase after 12 months. Furthermore, the international call rates are much lower and calls are free to some countries in Europe    Reliability has been good. If for some reason the line goes dead, the calls get automatically forwarded to my cellphone. This rarely happens, to fix it, I need to unplug it for a seconds and the unit will reset automatically. My guess is that this happens because of problems with my broadband provider and not because of Vonage itself.",

Not sure if the originals will work again but as long as the new sticks work then that will not be an issue. Pressed the four new sticks in place making sure to align the stick in the slot properly and being careful to ensure that they are properly seated in the slot. Take a mental note or a quick picture of the height of the original sticks before you remove them so you can visually confirm the new sticks are fully seated.  Replace the cover and tighten the screws finger tight ensuring the cover is flush with the frame of the computer. Plug everything back in and power up.  The system booted up in what seemed to be the regular amount of time it took with 4GB. Confirm that the system sees the new RAM by clicking on the apple and selecting the \\\\\"about this imac\\\\\" menu item. It sees all 16GB and seems to run about the same but some things seem a bit quicker after first use. Running a game \\\\\"Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare\\\\\" definitely loads and runs faster.

Just pull it out of the box, cable it to a router port (like the LAN cable in Hotel Rooms) and you are ready to pair your devices.  However if you want anything more, read on.<br /><br />First to be clear, what is the difference between an Access Point and a Router?  A router lets multiple devices (Wifi, cable or both) share an Internet Line like a cable or DSL modem.  The router provides all the functions to make this happen.  An AP does NOT connect directly to a modem or like device.  It REQUIRES that what you connect to a line that already has the functionality of some kind of LAN routing device like a router port.  The AP has more limited functionality.  It simply allows multiple devices (wifi only in this case) to share a single router port or similar type connection.  It has less functionality than a router so is dependent on there already being a router behind it.<br /><br />This device can also act as a number of other device types as the description details.  There is also much more information on the TP-Link web site.  Go there before buying if you want this to do anything other than use this as a default AP device.<br /><br />If you do want to access the administration menu to do anything, it does not access like most other routers.  Most routers work fine if your computer LAN poert is set to automatic IP and DNIS addressing .  Because auto-DNS can cause problems sometimes on wide area networks like in a Hotel or large business, the addressing is static and you have to change your LAN port to a specific configuration if you want to access the menus on this device.

I put off ordering the HiRise for my iMac for months. It sat it my cart. Then it was &#34;Saved for Later.&#34; Then it was relegated to my &#34;Wish List.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Do I really want to pay $70 bucks for this thing?&#34; I kept asking myself. &#34;$50? Maybe. $30? Sure. But $70? Really?&#34;<br /><br />The problem, though, is that I'd tweaked my back running and had been in-and-out of physical therapy for it for months and months. I did the stretches and exercises religiously. I iced. I took medication.<br /><br />You name it, I did it -- except making an ergonomic workspace. I didn't want to spend the money, sacrifice my retro orange office chair, or rearrange my desk. But I sit at my desk for 8-12 hours a day working at my computer. Ergonomics needed to be dealt with. First, I jettisoned that orange chair and picked up the Ikea chair recommended as the &#34;best budget&#34; ergonomic office chair. That made a big difference. Immediately, I noticed the effect on my back.<br /><br />But one problem lingered. I was slouching to see my iMac. I'm tall. The screen was too low. Most experts say your eyes should be near the top of the visible area of the screen when you sit up straight. Some even say closer to the middle. My eyes were all the way above the top of the fame of my iMac. Over the course of the day, I'd slouch more and more, defeating the lumbar support of the chair, since I wasn't sitting up straight. Something had to change.<br /><br />I experimented placing the iMac on some books. Immediately, it helped. I could get to the proper sitting height. I was sitting straight. The lumbar support of the chair was hitting me in the right spot. My feet were on the ground. My elbows were resting comfortably on the armrests.<br /><br />But there was one problem: Did I really want to leave my precious iMac (and all of my work) entrusted to a few old hardbacks? (And they'd have to be ones I'd planned to read but realistically knew I'd never get to. &#34;Ulysses,&#34; anyone? Maybe &#34;Gravity's Rainbow&#34;?) The iMac is designed to sit on a table. It balances there well. It's not likely to tip on that surface and, were it to tip, it would only tilt a few inches before hitting the table. Not great, but not terrible. Balancing on some slippery hardbacks (or, worse, unstable paperbacks)? It's not designed to do that. And the fall? Now we're talking some serious height.<br /><br />So, finally, I took the plunged and ordered the HiRise. When it arrived, I was worried. Would it be worth it?<br /><br />Immediately, I was struck by how well-packaged it was. As I took the pieces out, I noted how solid (and heavy!) they were, along with how perfectly they matched the iMac. Contrary to other reviews, putting together the unit I received was easy. Everything lined up perfectly. (And it comes with a hex tool for the screws.)<br /><br />Once I had it all together and my iMac placed in it (after some experimentation, I went with the highest shelf position -- like I said, I'm tall), I was thrilled. It looks great and, most importantly, it's sturdy. Using the screws to attach the back plate, it's safe to assume the iMac won't be going anywhere, forwards or backwards. And the base is wide and (like I said) very heavy. You couldn't tip the HiRise over, side to side, if you tried. (One other nice touch was a small grey rubber bumper around the opening where the iMac goes to prevent scratching.)<br /><br />So, could you use some books? Absolutely. Would it be better if the HiRise for iMac was $20 or $30 bucks cheaper. Yes. But not if it meant a sacrifice in quality.<br /><br />At the end of the day, $70 bucks is a small price to pay for good ergonomics (as well as the assurance that you iMac won't topple off that unread copy of &#34;Moby Dick!).my precious iMac (and all of my work) entrusted to a few old hardbacks?

The driver comes with CD has a bug such that you need to open its control panel after every reboot to get the sound out. Some said C-media's driver fixes it but I tried and it actually makes it worse. Turtle Beach's update driver Mar 2006 does fix this problem.  <br /> <br />But none of the driver fix its second problem. Which is very important to me. The problem is that it's microphone is way too unsenstitive. Turn the microphone volume control all the way to maximum and you still need to speak very loud right in front of the microphone to have it output a tiny sound. I happen to have a webcam with microphone so I know how bad the built-in mircophone in Montego DDL is. It just doesn't work. Too bad without using microphone intergrated in sound card will cause echo. So I still need to get a sound card with working mircophone. If you do no plan to use microphone, buy this card which is a good value. Otherwise, don't try your luck. Its microphone just doesn't work. <br /> <br />I end up returning this card. Stick with Santa Cruz which still work fine.",

I was very skeptical from changing from hardcover books to virtual, and I still buy and read hardcover books, but the ease of the Kindle makes it much easier to fulfill my rapid cycle through various books. The books are (usually) slightly less expensive and I can carry around just one device with multiple books on it.

And it seems i can not get any help ... because Samsung no longer accepts the existence of this model. they have ALL the other models just not THIS ONE. and thus i can't seem to get anywhere in contacting customer service because i need to select the model from their list ... but they don't make it any more so clearly no one will ever contact them in regards to a brand new laptop shipped directly from SAMSUNG! I am extremely upset. up until this moment i was a die hard Samsung fan. Now i am gravely sorry i didn't just by a MacBook and iPhone, tho i may just return my new Galaxy S III and this laptop and do just that.<br /><br />  Problem: EVERY TIME I TURN ON MY LAPTOP AND CONNECT TO MY WIRELESS NETWORK, THE *ENTIRE* NETWORK CRASHES.<br /><br />I am sure there is a simple solution to my problem. however i am not a techie savant so alas problem. It's brand new out of the box and i don't feel that i need to pay to bring it to someone to FIX a problem on a NEW computer i just spent over a grand on! I did go and update all the updates listed on the laptop. And even disconnected from the \\\\\"HomeGroup\\\\\". That helps for about 45min and then back to the same problem. i searched online and saw that some people suggest something about redownloading the drivers or what not ... again i don't feel that i should have to jump through these hoops and wish that Samsung had a better system to for issues, because the one they have is gravely flawed.<br /><br />I do have multiple other laptops and wireless devices (including my Kindle Fire HD) and all the rest connect no problem. it is only once this is connected. i have tried even rebooting my router.<br /><br />Update: I have since returned the computer with zero hassles from Amazon.

Lower than expected battery life - I was expecting 3-5 hrs, get more like 2-2.5 unless you shut everything down.    Power supply issue: my computer had an issue with the supplied 2-prong A/C adapter where a small amount of voltage ran through the wrist/palm rest area of the notebook. A \\\\\"buzz-like\\\\\" vibration could be felt, that was only noticeable as you slide your fingers/hand across the wrist area, and disappeared once the A/C adapter was unplugged. After discovering the problem's cause on [...] I called up Sony and they over-nighted me a new 3-prong A/C adapter that fixed the problem.     Summary: a great powerful, portable notebook that fits my needs perfectly. Would definitely buy again. Not 5 starts due to shorter battery life, pre-loaded garbage, and power supply problem.",

            "input": "Personal perspective: I purchased an Airbender Air 2.0 direct from Idealpoint. After setup a number of keys were discovered to be bad and/or non-responsive. I was anxious to get a working keyboard; therefore, to save time, I received an RMA from Idealpoint and shipped the case back and ordered one from Amazon Prime at the same time. When reviewing the 2.0 on Amazon, I believe I addressed fairly the quality control issue regarding the keyboard as well as  what I thought of the functioning keyboard I got from Amazon.<br /><br />Airbender Pro:<br /><br />The package was well organized and the instructions for assembly were clear, concise and easy to follow. The 1st thing I noticed after unpacking was the bulk of this case. It is built well and it is obvious that it will accomplish its protection mission easily. Additionally, it fits like a glove which provided comforting \u201cclicks\u201d as it went together. It is definitely designed for the Air!<br /><br />It is heavy (2.58 lbs with iPad); however, I felt the weight was reasonable considering the level of protection it would obviously provide my tablet. When this case is closed it feels very secure (like a tank!) and provides access to all iPad ports and has the auto off/on feature in the cover that actually works well. However, there were obvious compromises made to ensure this security.<br /><br />One of them is weight which makes the unit feel top heavy in your lap. After using the case in laptop mode for a week I began to understand that perception., However; in fact it only \u201cfeels\u201d top heavy and does not really impact usage but is annoying. I have used it setting on the arm of an easy chair typing this review in lap top mode and it is very stable. Many people use iPad keyboard cases in their laps and if you have the extension arm directly in between your legs it can feel unstable  If you move it right or left slightly it is stable as it is on a desktop. An easy solution for this would involve broadening the extension or provide an optional slide out piece that would establish a leverage base to one or both legs. Refinement of this one piece would silence many critics.<br /><br />Other observations which could be complaints by some users are:<br /><br />1. The locking and extension mechanism on the metal extension arm while innovative, is somewhat clumsy and could be improved. There should be a way to ensure the arm stops when it reaches its maximum extension without pulling away from the keyboard. Essentially, the release next to the extension should only serve to release the tablet from the keyboard<br /><br />2. Initially there is a tendency to pull the outer protection loose at the space bar location when opening until you adjust your opening habits.<br /><br />3. The ports are so well protected that they may be difficult for some to easily access. However, the only port cover I found difficult and needed a real fingernail was the lock/mute port but I use the software lock/unlock feature (swipe from below) and you can easily mute with the volume button so it\u2019s a non-issue unless you really want to use the switch for manually locking the screen orientation.<br /><br />4. Due to it's bulk and weight you can not maintain lower angles while reading without the tablet lowering to the keyboard.<br /><br />5. The bulkier edge coupled with the built-in screen protector at times produces a lack of sensitivity on the edge of the screen when moving apps/folders to another screen.<br /><br />The Bluetooth function found the iPad easily and has worked flawlessly as did the version 2.0 previously. The keyboard charged in 45 min and has outstanding battery life as advertised and every key functions as it should to include the iPad specific row on top.<br /><br />The ability to remove the tablet from the stand easily, use the stand and iPad apart from the keyboard, 360 deg iPad rotation and the ability to position the screen at many different angle for reading, etc. makes this case extremely versatile.<br /><br /> In my opinion, at over $169 the Clam Case, which I owned, is this case\u2019s only competitor and for all that money its only real advantage is it has a stiffer screen positioning mechanism. You can\u2019t go wrong with this case and I would recommend it highly.",

It was cheap, and the materials used reflect that, but this should be expected. The leather they used is holding up well, but I have numerous threads that are coming out of the leather. Grade: B<br /><br />Screen Protection: I like the front cover on the case. It provides, to me, a sense of protection to the screen of the phone from scratches and drops. I do not know how much protection it provides, but there were times where I mishandled the phone and thought for sure my screen would be smashed. As it turns out, my screen is intact so far! Additionally they send a screen protector. If you take your time and are patient, you will not have any problems with it. I have no bubbles, and it works as intended. Grade: B+<br /><br />Phone Body Protection: The plastic case that surrounds the phone and keeps it mounted to the leather is brittle. I drop my phone a lot, and I expected this case to be able to handle most of the minor bumps. After a week, the cheap plastic started to show its true colors. Pieces would constantly break off, and at one point had a sharp piece near my ear that would make it uncomfortable. After a while, all of the plastic that wants to break off will break off. However, despite the lack of plastic, my phone has remained in the case and in place. Grade: C-<br /><br />Convenience: It is nice to be able to leave your wallet at home and only take the essentials for the night. Cash works fine if it\u2019s folded and not in large quantity, and you can easily store an ID and credit card. The cash slot also makes a great screen wipe holder. The only disappointment was that the bottom slot became unattached from the case, and if I'm not careful the card will slide all the way down making it a challenge to remove. Grade: B (would've been higher if credit card slot stayed attached)<br /><br />Design: This was not too feminine and rather conservative (which is good because I\u2019m a guy!). The stand feature works 80% of the time (the other 20% the phone slides out of your viewing angle), and the magnetic flap gets in the way of viewing unless you bend it back (once you break it in it is not an issue). Taking pictures with the back camera is somewhat of a juggling act. I do not take pictures often, but if you do this will be bothersome. I have not experienced any flash glare. Front camera works fine. Also, the stylus is cheap, and I broke the clip on it the first week, which is sad because it was really nice to have. Grade: B-<br /><br />Overall: I still use this case daily. I am not dissatisfied for what I got, for the price I paid, but there are areas that could be improved. Grade: C+/B-",

When I opened it, it seemed very pretty and slick, the drive can have a password protection and there is also a way to encrypt your files. The problems started when I tried to do such things. The most simply of tasks, backing up, can't be done with this drive. It stalls if the backup is too big and after a few minutes it completely stopped. It has taken 2 hours just to backup 700Mb of data due to the fact that it has been halted to 100Kb a second, something that any modern drive can beat easily. Going through forums to fix the problem yields no results due it being a software error. Its also worth noting that this is IF you want to have password protection on your drive. If not you can just delete all the WD software and leave it completely bare, which is not the point of anyone buying this hardware. Completely disappointed in this product.",

It looks and fits okay, but the micro-chip in it sometimes can't make sense of what it's current charge or time remaining is.  I initially wanted to return it, as i assumed it was faulty, but Amazon made it such a hassle that I am just gonna suck it up.  I am trying to drain it completely before charging it...completely, hoping this will extend it's life.   So, bottom line--- if you are like me and are at the cusp of getting a new Macbook anyway but just want to keep your old one on life support, go for it....I can't rationalize spending $130 or more on a battery for an old laptop.",

The setup was annoying, because occasionally, when I would apply a new setting, the router would never come back online, after 'rebooting'. I usually had to go back to my basement, and power cycle the router. Eventually, I got everything set properly.<br />Then my wife complained that her tablet kept disconnecting. I changed some settings, and it appeared to work, for about a week. Then I started having issues where my whole house wifi would reset, usually while gaming on my PS4.<br />So, last weekend, I factory reset the router, and started over. The setup went much better this time, and everything appeared to be good. Then I went to remote into work, and my desktop PC (wired), would not connect. I then tried my server PC, which is wired, but had been off. It too would not connect. So, I tried to access the router, using the web interface, and it just sits on a screen saying 'waiting'. Looked on the Linksys forums, and I see this problem has existed for over a year, and has not been even acknowledged by Linksys.<br />So, I try the mobile app, and it connects, then shows the 'searching' screen after about a second. Then it finds the router, and one second later, it searches again. It's an endless loop. I even tried reinstalling the app (and clearing cache). As soon as you look at devices, it goes into the loop. Look at the comments on the app, and you'll see (again) this is a common problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all this trial and error, has extended me past my return period. I just ordered a Netgear, and I'm done with Linksys. I bought this to replace my e2000, which had been acting flaky, and randomly resetting the wireless connection to my laptop (no other devices were dropped). I'm done with Linksys.

I bought a Kindle 2nd Generation back in 2009 (?)  and I truly think the Paperwhite is  what I was looking for with my original Kindle.  I have an iPad and people ask me all the time \\\\\"Why do you need a Kindle AND an iPad?\\\\\"  The iPad is wonderful. I love mine but it has limitations. It's a little heavy after holding for a period of time, it strains my eyes, and try reading on it outside, because it won't happen. But you probably already know that. So back to the review.... let's talk about the benefits of the Paperwhite.<br /><br />It's lightweight but still sturdy. I don't feel like I am straining to keep it held while reading, but it is also sturdy enough that I think it could stand some minor drops (I hope this doesn't happen, but it probably will). I love the fact that it is touchscreen. Not only that, but a fairly responsive touchscreen for the money (a minor flaw I'll mention later). My Kindle 2 had this round chiclet-style keyboard that may have been fine in the day, but always just seemed off to me. I am SO glad the keyboard is gone (and has been for a while, I know). Highlighting on the Paperwhite is a breeze compared to the old joystick style.<br /><br />I also love the lighting feature. Duh, that's why most of us are buying them. I have been very lucky with my Paperwhite. I don't see any dark areas like some people have mentioned. It's a perfect amount of light that illuminates the screen. The E-ink is noticeably sharper than in previous generations. It's nice to see grey type on a white screen compared to the grey on grey with previous generations.<br /><br />I also love the feature that tells me how long until the end of the chapter. Perfect for when I find myself yawning a little too frequently and need to finish up.<br /><br />I know this sounds kind of odd, but I also like the rubber-type material that is the Kindle backing. It's not cold like an iPad andseems to be a little more scratch resistant.<br /><br />What don't I like? Once you get used to the responsiveness of a higher end tablet, the Kindle can feel a little sluggish. But I have to remember that this is for READING, nothing else. That's honestly all I can say negative about it and that's not even a major gripe. The special offers on the screen don't really bother me.<br /><br />For the money, I don't think there is a better e-reader on the market. I have enjoyed it at home and cannot wait to take it on the road and on the plane. After 10,000 feet, of course :)",

The screen was very wet, and my fingers stuck to the sticky side of the film even though they were wet too.  I tried to imagine how I would explain to Amazon (after I destroyed the Kindle) why this seemed like a good idea at the time.  The result was a smeary screen full of tiny bubbles that would not smooth out.  I pushed so hard with the plastic device provided with the kit, that I was leaving marks in the screen protector.  I left it alone for a few hours, but it didn't look any better.  I pulled it off (and was relieved to see the Kindle screen was still okay) and tried putting it back on again with more fluid.  There were fewer bubbles this time, but more smears.    I couldn't look at it anymore, and put it away in a drawer for two days.  Amazon was prompting me for a review, so I pulled it out to take pictures of the crappy application.  I was willing to take some blame for the bad results, but I thought people should know how difficult this product is to apply correctly.  I work at a library and have successfully applied numerous screen protectors to a variety of devices.

The keys are large enough so that my relatively-large hands are able to access them without any errors. Even as I type this review, I am not experiencing any issues.<br />  So far, I have not encountered any problems regarding signal connection or latency. There have been times when I press a key and it becomes virtually &#34;stuck,&#34; causing the same letter to appear repeatedly. However, this usually happens when I am typing while the tablet is busy performing some moderately intensive task, so I assume that the issue is not caused by the keyboard.<br />  The keyboard looks and feels like a luxury item. However, there are two design features which irritate me:<br />  1) The cover/stand's surface is a dust magnet! After only three days of owning the keyboard, the cover somehow managed to cover itself in a noticeable sheet of dust. It is relieving to know that the cover serves its purpose by keeping the keys clean, but I would have appreciated if the thing did not have a tendency to collect dust. Perhaps Microsoft did not consider that Arizonans would purchase this item.<br />  2) That same dust-collecting cover has a third purpose. The only way to turn off the keyboard is to place the cover on it. This feature would not trouble me so much if the keys were not so close to the edge of the keyboard. There were times when I would place the cover on, unaware that I was pressing the shift key in the process. This caused some unwanted shift-click functions when I was attempting to use my tablet's touchscreen. To address this, I usually turn off my tablet's bluetooth receiver before putting on the keyboard's cover. I wish that Microsoft would have designed the keyboard with a basic on-off switch.",

The lightweight, the balance, the thinness, true Sony craftsmanship<br />- screen colors are rich, the resolution more than adequate at this size. I like the true HD and elongated form factor more than I expected.<br />- Sony Apps: SideView remote way cool -- it's made me enjoy using my television again. Sony Unlimited music doesn't get enough cred. This is really an excellent service with HD streaming, offline playback and playlists, and a virtually unlimited (as the name says) music catalog.  I use this along with Tuned In Pro for my radio.<br />- Waterproof is more useful than I thought. When on vacation, I used in and around the swimming pool. Nice feature.<br />- Battery very fine, longer than I expected due to lightweight form factor.<br />- Speed very fine, no problems for me, snappy.<br />- Music and sound are quite good for a tablet. I pair it up with my Jambox, or else use headphones, so it is more than adequate in my opinion.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- guest mode was removed. maybe this will come back in next OS update. minor, but nice feature for sharing in the family.<br />- screen is a bit smudgy. I may step up for the screen protector.<br />- the cradle is well designed and very useful. downside is the 3' USB cable. It needs a 6' cable to be able to use a floor socket. this was a compromise as the old Sony tablets had real power supplies.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm extremely happy with this tablet, with the speed and the business apps like Skype, box, and office I can finally use this as a real laptop replacement. The entertainment options rock, and this makes a true fun and business device for me.  I think the price is fair. It's a real laptop equivalent but better in so many ways. The engineering and form factor that Sony puts into the product, I can see the difference.  This is a 3rd generation product and it shows.",

I did not base my decision on these other fake reviews as I did my own research to see how it holds up against all other sub $200 tablets. Everything I read seemed like it was a very promising product.  Cons: At one point, I turned on the tablet and the whole screen was pixilated. It eventually cleared up but this is not something that should happen with any tablet, ever.  You have to download and install your own .apk files. I've found that once the tablet goes into \\\\\"sleep mode\\\\\", it's very difficult to get it to boot back up. It took me 4 hours at one point to get the device to turn back on. The keyboard buttons are too flat and makes it difficult to type.   Pros: it has a beautifully responsive touch screen that responds just as well as an iPad. The internet ran screaming fast. It's really nice to watch movies on (even though the resolution is 800x600, but it's a sub-$200 tablet, to be expected). There is no choppiness at all like you see with a lot of tablets under $200  Overall it's a good product, but has a couple major bugs that need to be addressed.

            "input": "11/11/14:    I LOVE this tablet very very much. I personally do a lot of artistic things and go to school so this is very handy when out n about. Also very nice for organization! I carry much less than i used to, ie: binders and books , since iv'e had this. i have a small pouch where i carry my tablet in it's case, the charger just in case (you never know) ear buds, and a wireless keyboard.    Body: Slender but a good weight in the hand but I use it in a case( very light the backpack!!!) . Stylus tucked flush in the bottom right of the tablet, power button top right, volume right beneath it- windows button (toggle between screen on the left. There is NO USB port for your thumbdrive, only the smaller port. I suggest purchasing a OTG Micro to USB 2.0 Adapter if you frequently use a thumb drive.    Screen: Sensitive, the included stylus is perfect with the different pressure levels. that feature is taken away if you use another stylus, but still works with my backup pen. I suggest getting a screen protector for your tablet! Particularly if you have a heavy hand when writing or you think you will find yourself writing a lot in general.    ***CAUTION*** Research your cases for your tablet! Ask questions about it with the sellers! I purchased a case i assumed to have no magnets by the look and the description from a seller on amazon-but it ended up having small magnets to keep a back panel secure. Magnets WILL mess with the sensitivity/connectivity from any stylus to the screen- creating a fade-out effect. Always double check- even if it's said to be made for your tablet.    Battery life: Perfect for my needs! They say up to 8 hours, but it really depends what you do- If you have several programs you're going between- like listening to music on youtube and running a drawing program for a while- itll drain a battery a little quicker. just use common sense- tap the power button when you're done with it.    *A note on Apps!*  The tablet comes with really handy apps for everyday use- note-taking and organizational purposes.  I prefer the Windows Journal for my class Notes for its easy-to-edit ability. If you write a bit more neatly, the OneNote will work perfect- particularly if you like more visual organization methods. I wanted to add this so other students did not feel they had to rush off to get an app right away without looking at these included ones first! ALSO- you do not HAVE to have programs as an app from the app store! You can download programs as you normally would on your windows 7 (if that is what you are accustomed to) All the programs are listed in app mode when you swipe up (so you know where to find your new programs you downloaded in PC mode.)    Typing vs handwriting: I have smaller hands mind you, but i found this actually very easy to type on when in a case, (in lap or on a table for long periods of time) but I you have need for more wiggle room, id suggest a wireless keyboard if you see yourself typing ALOT in the foreseeable future. :) Handwriting was very fun- more so than i thought it would be- just takes a little getting used to how you write.    Interchangeable between modes! Very handy on both accounts- I have found myself using both modes on the tablet for different things- only thing i wish still worked is listening to music on one- switching modes and still being able to hear it. It instead continues where you left off when you switch back. Not a huge loss though!    I suggest playing with this for a day, after you charge it completely- just so you can figure out how windows 8 works if you are new to it. Overall , I am totally dazzled by this, and find myself taking notes as often as i draw! Once im done with my drawing, I save, plug in my USB with my adapter, and transfer it to my laptop at home to continue off where i was in photoshop. Very mess free compared to carrying a bunch or art supplies or a heavy laptop around!    Hope this helped! I will update more if i come across anything new~",

I used my PC a lot for work and entertainment so I am used to pay a little heavy for things that I used a lot. I bought this because the original mouse of my PC started failing and I needed something fast an inexpensive. This is a good buy for someone that do not use their PC a lot. If you buy it, make sure you have an open USB port that you do not need, because it needs to be locked into a USB port. You will need to download the drivers from the manufacturer website in order to set the 5 buttons functions. Otherwise, it will just work like a normal mouse. Thankfully, downloading the drivers from the manufacture's website was a breeze and it was really easy to set up the buttons. It feels good in my hand also.. WARNING.. The battery compartment in this mouse is ill designed. It uses a AA battery, and to get the battery on or off its a mission. 3 starts for the battery compartment and for the weird feeling at left clicking. I will re-write a review in couple of months to update this.  UPDATE: I like to report that after getting used to it the mouse works really well. No problem so far with it.  I will recomend this purchase to anyone. Hopefully the manufacturers of this mouse will redesign the battery compartment. However, if you insert really good batteries it will work for a long period.

This on the other hand, is finally a quick and responsive 7\\\\\" tablet at nearly the same price as Fire. Apps just launch, graphic intensive magazine pages flow, and the touch screen keyboard is easy to use with my relatively large hands.

I'm sure I'll be adding more praises as time goes by.<br /><br />Only issue I'm having is that the compass is always 90 degrees off, it always points West instead of North.

A couple of reasons, perhaps.<br /><br />I noticed that the hard drive tray face plate, for lack of a better phrase, no longer includes the lattice of holes that were present on previous designs. Maybe this is stifling the air flow across the hard drives.<br /><br />I also noticed, while monitoring the system, that the [default] fan speed in the TVS-463 is apparently too slow to do much good for the hard drives. I stress default here because as soon as you change the fan speed from 'Smart Fan' to medium or better, the overheating issue is irrelevant, although the drives were still running warmer than they should be.<br /><br />My fan, set to 'smart fan', was rotating around 450-600 rpm even as the system began to beep and present a hard drive over temp warning. Interestingly, the CPU and System temps were normal. Does this tell us the hard drive temperatures are not taken into consideration when calculating the 'smart fan' speed? Perhaps there was a bug; who knows.<br /><br />In any case, I monitored the system and this behavior for a week. I contacted QNAP support to see what their response would be and they told me to &#34;set the device to medium fan speed.&#34;<br /><br />Are you familiar with the term work-around? :)<br /><br />Right, what else could be done? Nothing. Wait it out for a potential firmware update addressing the issue or return it and get one that doesn't overheat drives.<br /><br />Replacement candidates: TS-453 or TVS-471",

I can only say that I have not had any problems with it yet.  As for some other reviewers comments about the plastic corners on the back breaking, I have not tried to remove the case since first putting it on the iPad Air, so I don't know if I would encounter the same problems.  (I'm not going to press my luck :).  This case provides protection from mild bumps and screen protection from scratches, but I don't think it would help that much if the iPad was dropped.

Being a European in the US i miss very much widescreen broadcasts that i am used to there and so the HDTV option was the obvious.  I have it running on a 20\\\\\" 1.8Ghz iMac G5 with 1.26GB RAM and a 250GB HD (also another same external).  I live in a ground floor apartment which has no external aerial hookup so i have indoor (rabbit ears) antenna plugged into it (i may get up on the roof later and see if i can patch into the antenna).  The reception is not fantastic (though the strange thing about DTV signals it that you get no fuzz.  it's a fantastic picture, but it can drop out for a few seconds at a time.  it's not variable, it's either there and great looking or its not there.)   The system requirements shouldn't really be so low.  It really does require a dual G5.  Unfortunately you can't live downsample the HDTV signal to a 720 or SDTV signal to suit your machine.  HDTV signals are choppy.  Not really an ideal viewing solution.  Great if you have a dual processor G5 i'm sure.  But for anything less, don't expect much.  My solution is to record the HDTV programs (which is not proceesor intensive), then downsample and compress them (which still ends up looking better than a regular analogue US NTSC signal on a regular TV) and then watch the recorded downsampled programs.   <br /> <br />Note:  EyeTV software only records the unadulterated HDTV signal.  If you want to compress or change format you can export it (in EyeTV) to another format.  But beware this encoding take a long long time.  Turning a 30 minute recorded program into a MPEG-4 640x360 movie (which still looks really good from a TV viewing distance btw) it will take 4 hours (on my system which ain't the slowest by far!) <br /> <br />To be honest with you i bought this unit to replace my previous solution of downloading bittorrents of HDTV recorded programs.  These torrents have becoem less widespread due to certain file sharing law suits.  I like to beable to watch only the programs i like.  Most of the rest of american TV browsing i find to be depressing.  I do have a solution in this.  I now can replace these downloaded TV programs with a Legal alternative, however i now realise the work that the kind person who recorded those programs and compressed them  and put then on the internet did. <br /> <br />Result:  If you've got a dual processor G5 and a good antenna hookup then get one of these.  If you've got a lesser Mac and need to have a widescreen program (as i do) then get one but know that watching live TV won't be so good, and you'll have to wait a while before you can watch your recorded programs (a similar time it might be noted was required to download a program over the web).  If you want TV on your lesser mac and don't care so much about widescreen signals, then get one of the normal non-HDTV EyeTV tuners (the 200 i think?). <br /> <br />If your bugdet is not small.... fork out and get didicated hardware. i.e. a real HDTV and DVR.  It may be much more expensive but you won't have to put in so much work to watch your TV programs! <br /> <br />I'm not disappointed.  But i am very techy and very Mac oriented.  I wouldn't recommend this to someone who doesn't spend so much time playing around with computery things.  If you already have trouble programming a real VCR then purchasing one of these is gonna result in your having less hair. <br /> <br />hope this helped you.  Sorry if i waffled.",

There are two aspects of this mouse however that a potential buyer might want to consider.      First if you have a smaller hand print like mine, the buttons on the left side may be somewhat awkward to use.  It's hard for me to depress button four without depressing button five.  In order to compensate for my shorter thumb I have to grip the mouse at a slight angle which results in a less comfortable grip.  If I'm playing a game where the left mouse buttons are critical I switch to the R.A.T. 7 which has been optimized for my hand shape.      Also, even though there are five profiles that can be stored on the mouse, there is no button on the mouse specifically for switching from profile to profile without using the Mionix mouse software.   If a button like this were present, this mouse would be very near perfection.    Finally I have read several reviews of the Mionix Naos 5000 that criticized the weight distribution mechanism on the bottom of the mouse.  While it is true that the weight system is somewhat clumsy, I personally do not see this as a significant drawback whatsoever.  Once the mouse is weighted it would seem doubtful that the user would be constantly changing them.",

I have used this keyboard and mouse for several months (nearly a year).  The major complaint is this keyboard often misses keystrokes during normal typing.  You will type a word completely and correctly and occasionally a letter will be missing.  I write invoices about 5 to10 times a day and this occurs in nearly every invoice.  If this keyboard were a few years old then I would understand but it's less than a year old. I have been dealing with this since about the 2nd month of use.  I have tried changing batteries, relocating the USB dongle to different ports on my laptop/docking station (even moved offices but not for this reason).  Nothing improves performance.  Now I'm not saying this is junk.  On the contrary....for light to moderate use this keyboard is awesome.  I would highly recommend this for travel as the size is perfect.  As for using in an office for daily use.....well it just barely misses the mark.  I wanted to keep my desk free of clutter, looks like I'll be searching or a different keyboard at some point in the future.  I'll keep using this for now.     ORIGINAL REVIEW  -  The keyboard is very quiet as described.  The spacing of the keys is similar to a standard keyboard while excess plastic and trim has been removed.  Type just as you do on a standard keyboard without missing keys. The mouse is very small but perfect for travel.  The mouse covers a little less space than a credit card making it ideal for cramped locations.  They keyboard and mouse use two AAA batteries.  The keyboard is raised by the battery compartment providing a comfortable working angle.  Both items are very slim and easily stowed for travel.  When not in use, the USB wireless receiver can be stored in the battery compartment of the mouse (and arrives this way when purchased).  This review is to help those who are lookingat this product for its size.  This product has not been used extensively enough to offer any advice on reliability.  Product operating on a laptop using Windows 8.1.",

It's well designed, it's built well, and it just feels good and looks nice. I'm confident it's safe - and I'm a worrier!<br /><br />The design: Nice snug fit for the Touch, no slop nor too tight. The memory foam protects without adding bulk. I think it's the most streamline case (sleeve or not) I've seen with this much protection and ease of entry. The velco is just long enough to hold the case closed and short enough that the annoying ripping sound of velco is a quick.(A fact my spouse appreciates.) Since I don't have to stuggle with a longer piece of velco, it's no big deal to keep my Kindle in it's case.(An added bonus for when I don't want to look at the current screen advertisement.)The quilting on the cover helps me grip it better and adds to the case stability.<br /><br />The build: I'm very very picky. My sleeve didn't have the tinest bit of stitching off or any flaw. The case feels substantial and solid, even though it's light.<br /><br />Aesthetics: I was surprised how the brown color pleases me, since it's not a color of anything else I own. It's a rich chocolate brown with enough brightness to have some interest (vs black) yet still be subtle. It looks good lying on any surface -- it doesn't clash. I also enjoy the feel the slight yielding the memory foam will give when firmly pressed. (great for those boring moments....)<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying any sleeve -- get this one. It's just perfect. You'll soon forget the cost and just enjoy the product.",

Looking around at laptops, I realized I didn't want a netbook, despite the price and battery life, because of the tiny screen and keyboard.  Then I saw a 13.3 inch laptop at the store, and decided that was the perfect size.  Not too small and not too large.  My Toshiba is light enough to stick in my backpack and not worry about breaking my back, and it's small enough to fit as well.  The keyboard is decently sized, though it's missing an actual number pad.  The number pad is a small section of the keyboard used with the Fn key.    I have not tested the limits of this laptop, as I only meant it for school work.  Typing and internet use.  It does great at both of those.  The only game I've tried on this laptop is Minecraft, and I can say that that doesn't run all that well.    I've noticed that the speakers can be amazingly loud sometimes.  It's nice when you want to show a video or song to some people.  Even in a noisy room, it's possible to hear.    I am pleased with the battery life, as I can get out of my three hour class with about half the battery left, if I've got the brightness set down.  I'm sure I could do more to get more battery life.    The downsides to this laptop?  Every now and then, it's been a disappointment that it doesn't have a cd drive, but that isn't too bad a problem.  However, I do dislike the mouse pad(mouse pads in general, this is a pretty good mouse pad.  I just dislike using it).  That was one of the big issues I've had with laptops.  I haven't got around to buying a usb mouse yet, so I try not to complain much.    Overall, I'm glad I went for this Toshiba.  It was well worth the price, as I will be using it for a foreseeable while, and have already used it for a semester and a half.  If you are looking for a decent laptop at a decent price, one that is lightweight and not too big, one for school work, then Iwould definitely recommend this one.",

I noticed 2 problems specifically: 1) the plug does not fit snugly in the socket -- it can wiggle a bit, which can cause a disconnection in the line when the cable or switch is bumped.  2) the #1 pin (the orange/white wire connection using Standard 568B) does not always pierce the wire fully.  Upon further inspection, when the connector is crimped, there is a tendency for pin #1 to be pushed aside rather than driven into the wire.  This happened on two of the connectors.<br /><br />I decided to measure the plugs against the plugs of 3 other manufacturers.  The width of the 3 other manufacturers' plugs ranged from 0.457&#34; - 0.460&#34;.  These plugs measured 0.451&#34;.  This may seem like a small difference, but my assessment is that this smaller width is the cause for both the loose connection and the crimping problem.<br /><br />However, once I fixed the crimping issue, and if the wires/equipment is not jostled, the plugs work.",

After days and nights of figureing that out, I found where you could disable this message.  The help files and manuals do little other than tell you how to plug it in.  In troubleshooting, it tells you to disconnect the power and restart it.  The reset switch does not reset the base station.  If you go into the setup utility, your IP addresses and sharing and other things are the same.  The only thing the reset button does is reset the password.

It was hell getting the internet to work.  The Wan port is advertised as a gigabit port.  That may be true, but the other three ports are 100 Mbit ports--that's false advertising.  USB port is the main reason I liked about this base station.  I wanted to share my printer over it.  Printer sharing: It only works with about 15 HP printers, unfortunately, it does not work with my printer.  I also wanted to use the USB port for my external hard drive.  It works with USB thumb drives, however it does not work with drives formatted in NTFS-it only works with FAT formatted drives.  This again is not documented or advertised.  You are hard-pressed to find any support on the website.  It is a pretty unit.

When I told the company rep what the Amazon price was, she said that was quite a discount. Armed with that info, and the good reviews (these are also listed elsewhere on Amazon with a price of $38.99 and a lot of GREAT reviews), I ordered them.   Even with the standard shipping, they were here in just a couple days. Couldn't have been easier to set up and I'm VERY impressed with both the look and the sound. A couple other reviewers had issues with the blue light on the front of one speaker, which I don't get at all. It doesn't flash or anything, so I don't see it as any more intrusive than the blue light on the front of the computer.   And as an example of how great the sound is, I was watching a TV show on my computer where a couple of the characters were out in a thunderstorm. There was a big clap of thunder on the show that was so realistic, my dogs freaked out and hid under the table.

The drivers were available for both 32bit and 64bit Windows 7 (and earlier OS'es too) and seem to work just fine.<br /><br />Now the not so good.  First of all, the USB3 port is very tight, putting in and removing a USB device requires about twice the usual force.  In my notebook, this means the card ejects itself every time you insert or remove a USB device.  This is only a minor inconvenience though as it plugs right back in and works fine without rebooting.<br /><br />My real problem with this card though was the performance.  I bought it to hook up a [[ASIN:B007YXA5TC SanDisk Extreme 32 GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive SDCZ80-032G-X46]] to my notebook and while it works fine, it is not much faster than USB2.  On my USB2 port, the drive reads/writes at 30.8/25.7(MB/s).  Hooked up to this USB3 card, it is 37.7/36.6 or 22%/42% faster.  Just for comparison, hooked up to a native USB3 port on my desktop, the same drive is 198.1/109.0 or 543%/324% faster than USB2.  Note that the speed of my hard drive is not a factor here as I tested this speed using CrytsalDiskMark 3.0.1 which reads and writes directly to the drive you are testing, it does not copy data.<br /><br />So, if you are really just looking for an extra USB port that will sit flush with the side of your machine, and you are happy with it being just a little faster than a USB2 port, then this card is a good choice.  For me though, I wanted real USB3 speed and from that point of view I figure I only got a fraction of what I was expecting.",

I actually tried one foot controller that cost over $600. My problem was that the foot switch needed a lot of pressure to create the click, and that actually started giving me ankle and shin problems.<br /><br />I decided to try the StealthSwitch 3 programmable USB foot switch controller because it seems like a cheaper alternative to other things I saw on the market. I was pretty confused by it at first \u2013 I bought the wrong foot pedal.  Basically, the way this StealthSwitch FS \u2013 1 works is you need both the programmable USB foot switch controller and the StealthSwitch FS \u2013 1 momentary contact foot switch pedal with the 3.5 mm (1/8 inch) mono audio plug. Once I got both pieces though, it was awesome!<br /><br />It was very easy to set up \u2013 practically plug-and-play, although you do have to decide what kind of &#34;click&#34; you want the foot pedal to create. There is a drop-down menu and you can basically click left click, right-click, double-click \u2013 pretty much anything you could possibly click, it is an option.<br /><br />Once you assign a type of click to the foot pedal, you're good to click! This has completely revolutionized my ability to use the computer. By far, it is the best foot pedal I have found, because the StealthSwitch FS \u2013 1 uses the least amount of pressure to create the click of any foot pedal I have found. I bring one to work and have one at home.<br /><br />If you need a method for creating mouse clicks that does not use your wrist because of carpal tunnel syndrome or other hand or wrist problems, I really recommend the StealthSwitch programmable USB foot switch controller + the StealthSwitch FS \u2013 1.  Just make sure to buy the correct foot pedal to pair with the StealthSwitch 3 programmable USB foot switch controller\u2013 it has to be the one with the 3.5 mm audio plug, not the USB plug.o plug, not the USB plug.",

At their highest, movies are, let's say, comfortable.<br /><br />The keys are chicklet style--widely separated and little push. But unlike my older VAIO S150, the cursor won't skip around while typing, so no need for Touch Freeze. Tight here.<br /><br />At 11 inches it is much easier to type on than the my netbook, but not at all like my regular laptops. Probably no extended typing on this one.<br /><br />The screen is...OMG! It's not that the color is brighter it's the saturation! Colors are high contrast and just jump off the High Definition screen. Like nothing I've ever seen! It's the saturation, the WHITE (no yellow) background, and the razor (and I do mean razor) sharp HD screen. When desktop icons make you stare.....<br /><br />Processor speed. The Core 2 Duo Ultra Lo Voltage chip is as fast as any of my other Core 2 Duos. With the Core 2 Duo and Windows 7 Professional, absolutely no need for more than a gig of RAM. It has infinite settings and adjustments for everything possible. I set the power on the chip at 75% to extend the battery life (and not dim the screen), and it is sufficiently fast, but you can feel the chip tugging on the bridle. Powered down to 75%, and the ubiquitos Sony fan turned down to 'quiet', the battery gets 4 hours.

Third, how light and thin it is--even with the dual-layer DVD burner. Fourth the wifi--picks up places I didn't know existed. Has wireless a/b/g/n--and I still don't own an 'n' router.

I \\\\\"touch\\\\\" the button, I \\\\\"hold\\\\\" the button, I \\\\\"press\\\\\" the button and...nothing happens. Then I try again and again, it finally appears.

So far, this has been a flop as well.  Limited documentation.  I've set it up per the instructions in the admin console, but it does not seem to index anything for sharing.  My old Go Flex works perfectly.  Shame on you Seagate - you should be better than this.<br /><br />I rated it as a three, simply on the ease of setup on the network, the RAID protection and the general satisfaction of the physical box serving its function.

I wanted an elegant experience and something lightening fast.  This computer has it all!!!  I have used it for 3 months so far without any problems.  It is perfection in design and function.  I still don't know how they put everything into such a thin, but sturdy chassis.  The attention to detail is amazing.  It doesn't run hot sitting in my lap, which was another requirement.  There is a lot of subtle simplification in this computer.  It only has 2 USB2 ports, which are all that is needed when you add a powered hub [[ASIN:B0006TIA8Y CyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Hub]], and connect it with one USB2 cable.  The powered hub sits on a credenza that holds all the other devices I need (scanner, wireless mouse, DVD/CD drive, powered hard drive for backup, Scandisk flash memory, thumb drive, etc.  I run wireless to a Cisco router/LAN [[ASIN:B003B48UQ8 Cisco-Linksys E3000 High-Performance Wireless-N Router]] with a LAN printer and that leaves only the power cord and the USB2 cable to plug in or unplug.  I love the silence of a solid state hard drive.  I love everything about this computer.  It is an elegant and beautiful experience every time I use it.  I have the 64 bit Windows 7 and 2010 Excel/Word/Outlook programs.  What a wonderful software upgrade, and everything is so fast.  The screen is like looking at a photograph, it is so beautiful!!!  Welcome to a whole new world!!!  I have owned Dell computers for about 10 years and have always been impressed with their service when needed.  This was a replacement for a Toshiba tablet computer.  I will update this review if I encounter any problems.  I hope many of the Amazon readers will be able to enjoy this wonderful experience.<br /><br />Note added 12/10/2012:  Solid state hard drive died.  Replacement was approx. $480, so I purchased a new Dell laptop.  I still went with the SSHD on the new Dell, because it is just so fast.  Also enjoyed every minute using this machine.",

The bag does not open flat - only a top zip.  This is fine most of the time, but when one is taking the battery out, one needs both hands.  Tough to do.  And there is an additional USB port - but at the bottom of the battery compartment.  Again, difficult to use.<br /><br />If you are thinking it would be a simple process to re-route the included cords - nope.  It is simply not doable.  One of the pockets is clearly designed for your iPod.  I do not own any Apple products - so one compartment is occupied by an Apple connector.  Useless to me.  The other \\\\\"powered\\\\\" compartment has both a micro USB and mini USB.  The micro USB bent when I inserted it into my Android phone.  It is no longer usable.  I COULD return it - but I think I can get a little mini-to-micro adapter and be fine.  If an adapter from Apple to micro exists, I don't know about it. I think this is flimsy construction, since I have never bent a micro USB before - though I know it does happen.<br /><br />The construction of the bag seems solid.  I like that the supplied charger cord (for the bag itself) can be used either while the battery is in the bag - or out of the bag.  One could have more than one battery - and always have one charged.  Due to the cost of batteries - I likely will not choose to do this.<br /><br />The battery came charged - mostly.  3 bars out of 4 possible.",

I am very happy with this and I have installed it on my cars dashboard. It blends in nicely, I don't have an ugly universal windscreen mount clogging up my screen and I can attach and remove my phone in an instant. It comes with all the attachments you need although I did use a different screw that had a nut on to allow me to fix it to my dashboard. All other screws are for wall mounting only and therefore do not need a nut to be tightened from the rear.<br />The grip is very strong when aligned with the supplied metal disc (comes with two) but it will still attach even when not fully aligned. This happened once and when I pressed my phones home button the phone tilted and came free from the magnet. Maybe there would be a stronger hold but I use an Apple iphone slim leather case which hides the metal disc and so there is not direct contact between the disc and the magnet. My phone has not fallen at all and it always holds in whatever position you want - even on bumpy roads.<br />I also intend to try this with my iPad in future. The magnet does feel strong enough but until I test it I cannot give any personal recomendations for this. I might try the Magbak magnets for this especially as the magnets are very slim and discrete. But with the shapes of iPads changing all the time I would have to keep buying a new model of Magbak each year too as they are not universal like the iOwall.<br />The only downside to the iOwall is that if I want to upgrade my phone I would have to remove the metal disc as I don't think I can buy these discs separately? Like I say I can't buy these direct from iOwall. I currently have one disc glued to one of the Apple stickers that comes with your iPhone and that sticker is stuck to the back of my phone. It doesn't look great but it won't damage my phone and it's also covered with a case so you cannot see it.<br />Over all I am very happy with this item.

It holds the kindle 3 perfectly and securely...without covering any buttons and without any hooks sticking into the kindle...I've heard there were problems with those. I also got the M-Edge reading light that is made for these covers. It is plenty bright and the AAA battery lasts long and are available everywhere. Perfect!!!

I had to download a manual because I lost the one shipped with it but that was relatively easy to find.  It paired with no problem to my Blackberry Pearl but it took a little work and reading before I could pair it to my laptop. I kept getting an error for one of the drivers (Lubix NC1 mono audio) so I disabled it and tried again and now I'm listening to my music thru this headset. The sound is okay, not high fidelity, but it does sound better then my laptop speakers.  The headset is worth the price I paid for it and it does the job it is made for. One little detail I took issue with is the website listed for support: [...] takes you to a blog about New Age Philosophy.   For real? What does that have to do with a bluetooth headset?

After less than a year, this dock stopped working.  There was no sign of physical wear, but the fit of the docking connector just wasn't there -- I had to push my iPad down onto the connector and hold it in place to make the connection and continue charging.

So, anyone seeing this, my vote is a 3.5 rather than a 4!<br /><br />Pros:<br />I'm new to the Kindle world, but my wife owned a kindle keyboard and I've used hers a few times over the years. I decided to purchase a cover to protect my new Kindle, since most assuredly my kids would drop it. This cover has a good grip, and it's durable; granted I've only had it a month. I like the feel of it, the grip, and the colors. It is fairly easy to hold (more on this later) and doesn't slip out of my hand.<br /><br />Cons:<br />These two reasons are why I am not voting 5. It's over priced! I do think it's better than the other options, but I struggle with whether it's worth the price or not. Because of that, I struggle to recommend this.<br /><br />Secondly, I wish it had some sort of strap to lock it open. If Amazon does do something like that, I'd like mine to be replaced, or at least they should send me a retro-fit kit. Anyway, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to hold it. Sometimes I hold it open, and other times I hold it closed. I find it most comfortable holding it with my right hand, but the left is a bit more uncomfortable and awkward. Amazon needs to figure out how to lock it open with a strap, magnets, button, or something. If that is addressed, then it would be more of a 4 to me rather than a 3.5.

Dont bother trying to move the apps to an SD card. It is not yet supported. I've tried remapping an all of it. Once I learned a few things, what works and not, i came to be happy with the device. Yes, it is better than the chrombooks. Less work arounds. The thing is, doing it this way can be hard too. Have someone help you.<br /><br />1. Create a virtual drive. Be careful, but its not hard to do on your sd card. get the large one up to 64gb, nothing higher supported atm. You need to create a script, use windows task manager and set it to run the virtual drive. There are good explanations on the net. Adding links will only get them removed by amazon anyway.<br /><br />2. Even when things download, they love to go on the c drive. Copy and paste them to the virtual drive, then run them. They tend to run and download from there. ALSO ONEDRIVE AND DROPBOX can be a pain, so do them this way as well. (cut and paste). If you are not doing a ton ont he computer, you dont have to move it. Also, each has a setting to move the folder to another drive. They may not go to a removable device, hence making a virtual drive out of the sd card. You can manually move them if you choose. The HP drive comes with the computer and has no limit as of right now. It is just on the file size you upload, not how many things you upload.<br /><br />3. Remove bloatware. Go through the reviews here depending on what you want to keep. Remove the junk. Or buy a clean setup from hp directly. Careful with APPs. they take a lot of room. I'd suggest getting things you can't download any other way. For example, skip the kindle app, and download the pc version onto your virtual drive. Besides, you do get a card to buy a few free things. I opted not to use word 365...i have another version that is subscription-less. I loaded the other version onto the virtual drive, but assumenot many people can do that unless its older versions. Open office is a free software you can use to write.<br /><br />4. You can change settings using libraries. I didn't want my pictures and dpwnloads to stay ont he c drive. This is not too hard to get once you read it a few times. I mapped folders with the same names onto my virtual drive. Ex. Program files, Program files(x86), pictures, documents...i added them to link with the c drive libraries to &#34;show up&#34;. I then removed the primary (c drive) which automatically makes the virtual drive ones Primary. so you may see Documents, and Documents (your name here). Don't delete the c drive ones. Just read up on this and you should find an answer out there. Make sure that everything points to the correct folders. Start with one at a time to make sure it works.<br /><br />And that is just a few things that you can do. I know its a bit tech heavy, but for the price, I felt it was worth it. Now, I did this not know anything when I started.  I prob can't answer a bunch of questions. Basically, this is what I found that works. No, its not really easy. Creating the virtual drive was hardest for me. Not the mounting part, but the script because I was making my own drive letter. So I have a c drive, a d drive which is my sd card, and a partition on the sd card that is virtual drive E.<br /><br />I am new to windows 8.1, and there may be a better way to do this. This is just one way or one options. I'd look up how to show windows libraries first as they were not set up on mine. I hated windows 8.1, but i see some things that are easier. Everything feels hidden. Remember to leave space on your c drive to help the computer run fast. So far, I've had no trouble with my blue 11 in stream. I was so frustrated for over a week. I guess I just miss the lil netbooks that worked so great for me. I can't afford a surface right now, but those are the new thing :)<br /><br />The case feels plastic, but smooth, keys dont click to loud and are wide enough for my fingers. the view is not great, but not bad either. I can see everything without a clipped end. I really do like it, though i feel windows 8.1 on such a small drive is redonklous. Each person will have a slightly different opinion based on what they do.<br /><br />I am using my computer to write, to do emails and internet, a few apps, read, and even the few programs I wanted to run take up more space than the drive has. I love it, and its been hard and fun trying to figure it and windows 8 out, but i do think it is worth the price...even over a chrombook if you do nothing else. Good luck!",

I wish they would have gone with the traditional text mode BIOS. Mouse support does not work for me and I don't even use a wireless input device so have to use TAB and cursor keys all the time.<br />Another quirk is the fact that the controller disappears from your BIOS boot order completely if there are other SATA HDD devices present in your system. This should not pose a problem if you want to move all your existing HDDs from your motherboard to the controller but It took me a while to realize...not being mentioned anywhere.<br /><br />To people having problems getting into the WebBios by pressing CTRL+H, you have to set the controller as your primary boot device in your system BIOS.<br /><br />A note of caution, this controller does not support JBOD but works with a single HDD in RAID0. There is a hidden way to enable the JBOD option with megacli but the feature does not work regardless.<br /><br />However, I give this a solid 8/10.",

I'm sure converters like these would've been easier to find in Asia and if Lik-Sang's site was still operational... Thanks a lot, Sony!    I'm only giving this 4 stars because its design requires you to connect a wired Xbox360 controller to it in conjunction with the PS2 controller in order for it to function. You must use a Microsoft genuine wired controller for this to work.  It works by fooling your Xbox 360 by letting it detect the original 360 wired controller while it \\\\\"maps\\\\\" the control signals to your PS2 controller. It was an annoying realization at first because I didn't own a wired controller, and had to shell out another $22 to purchase one (Amazon has the cheapest price). But this shouldn't be a problem to those who all ready own one.     This is made in China and the instructions for this are horrible! Just make sure to put the switch \\\\\"NOT\\\\\" on Joystick position... you'll see what I mean when I say that \\\\\"the labels are not the same as in the given instructions.\\\\\"  If it doesn't work at first, just hit the switch the other way.    Aside from a somewhat tacky way of its design having to rely on a wired xbox 360 controller and its poorly written instruction manual, the quality and reliability is actually quite excellent. This is a great converter to have.  It's pretty inexpensive compared to the other types available in North America that are selling for at least twice the price.

The old drive is the new back-up, in a 2.5\\\\\" enclosure.<br /><br />*** update ***<br />after one year or serious use (changing climates and very serious traveling) this drive has performed flawlessly. as an added perk, i look at the new line of Mac laptops and see that only the highest end versions have drives this size; in any event, my daily use requirments have far exceeded the 40GB OEM that shipped , proving that while this is a great drive, it was also a necessary upgrade for me.",

These are slide cases, so if your drive is too thick, there's no way to make it work.<br /><br />They come with a short USB cord, screws, a small screw driver and some stick-on rubber padding. The screws are super small so they are easy to lose.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the USB port. These are attached to the board via the small solder tabs. This is normal, but if you plan on using this as a portable drive, I would recommend supporting the port with something between it and the hard drive. I used a small piece of PVC I cut 7mm wide and a little tape to hold it in place. Whatever you use make sure it is non-conductive and will not compress, otherwise you'll still be putting stress on the soldered tabs and eventually the port will crack off and separate. Other than that, great little aluminum brushed cases. Has a little blue operation led too for hard drive activity.<br /><br />I am also including a photo to describe what I did.

            "input": "I have tried several different cases for my [[ASIN:B00GQDBS7O Apple iPad mini with Retina Display]], and I've also had the unfortunate experience of dropping the iPad once (with a case in place), only to have the screen crack. (This case was not what I was using when that damage occurred). Fortunately the damage was only to the very corner of the glass and does not extend into the display area, and is something I can live with as long as it does not spread further. I also would point out that our home has very hard tile floors, which are not friendly to sensitive things that might be dropped on them. For that reason, I'm particularly attuned to the design of a case and how protective I feel it will be for these expensive devices.<br /><br />This is a very inexpensive case, and I evaluate it as follows:<br /><br />\u25ba Pros:<br /><br />- I like the strap design, because it will serve to keep the cover well closed and in that way ensure a better protection to the iPad when not in use.<br />- The rotating design of the cover is very nice and enables the cover to be used to prop up the iPad in both vertical or horizontal position so that you can read or watch videos in whichever position desired.<br />- The cutouts are well sized and provide good access to the charging port, volume control, and so forth.<br /><br />\u25ba Cons:<br /><br />- It does not automatically wake up the iPad, or put it in the sleep mode, when opened and closed.<br /><br />\u25ba Comments:<br /><br />- Styling is really a matter of personal preference. I don't particularly like this color and style myself. The green color is somewhat more bluish than what the photos posted here on Amazon show. The top cover is fairly thickly padded, which I like from the standpoint of protection but it does add a bit to the bulk of the device when installed in the case.<br />- Fit of the cover to the iPad is just OK. The iPad fits into the bottom plastic piece reasonably well. Some covers wrap around the corners a bit more and provide a more secure attachment to the iPad.<br />- I think that the quality of the materials used for this case is OK but nothing particularly impressive. It is an inexpensive case, after all.<br />- I judge protection to be only fair, for the following reasons. When closed, it will provide a very good protection to the screen, and the top piece is also padded and for that portion of the cover does look good from a protection standpoint. The bottom plastic piece is going to be too rigid to allow any 'give' if the iPad is dropped onto a hard surface if it impacts on a side or corner, and I do not think it would protect the iPad from damage in all cases for that type of drop. This is not that much different from many other covers in this respect, but some covers do have a softer rubber corner piece, or full bottom piece, that I feel will provide much better protection to those areas of the device.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4-stars primarily because it is a very inexpensive cover and I don't think it is fair to expect much from something at this price. I do think that someone wanting a more protective cover for their iPad will find others that will be more suitable. I'm presently using this [[ASIN:B00GOKXMUK Samsonite Punched Case for iPad mini (59076)]] which I purchased myself and which has rubber corner pieces which I am hopeful will be protective to the corners of the device. We have the Apple smart case for our full sized iPad, and it has a rubber base which provides really excellent protection to the corners and sides of the device. The Apple cases are considerably more expensive, of course, so it is simply a matter of deciding how much protection you want the case to provide, and how you use your device and whether or not you think you'll be dropping it very often and need to be sure it is well protected.<br /><br />I received this case from the seller without cost and for the purpose of writing an objective review, and this is my own honest opinion.ore and provide a more secure attachment to the iPad.<br />- I think that the quality of the materials used for this case is OK but nothing particularly impressive.

The device itself is great, but I have 2 major concerns with the way Amazon administers the content:    1- No way to hide, or limit content to other Kindle devices on your account.  If you purchase a Kindle for your 12 year old son (like I did for Christmas), you can't restrict access to books in your library.  I purchased \\\\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\\\\".  While I thought that the book was good, it definitely isn't for a 12 year old.  As long as both Kindle's are registered under the same account they both will have access to all content in that library.  Amazon's customer support suggests creating a separate account, but if you do this you can't share books between the accounts.  So, if we both want to read \\\\\"The Hobbit\\\\\" I would have to buy the book twice, once for my account, and once for his.......Lame!    2- Kindle book purchases use the \\\\\"1-click\\\\\" feature and there is no way to turn it off.  So, with my son's Kindle on my account there is now way to restrict purchasing on his device.  When you purchase from the device it doesn't ask for a credit card (it using the 1-click card on your account), it also doesn't ask for a password, nor does it even ask a purchase confirmation ..... if you click 'buy' it buys right then.  There is no way to turn this off, it's like turning your 12 year old son loose in the book store with your credit card.  Again, Amazon customer support's solution is to create a separate account, and use a gift card as the CC on the second account ....... double lame!    Like I said, I love the device itself, but if I had it to do all over again I'd take a closer look at how the Nook handles multiple devices on the same account.",

Personally I prefer the silver or white versions.<br /><br />[Bad]<br /><br />Tablet Stability: Because this thing tries to be versatile (which is a good thing), there's a price for it. It doesn't hold the tablet super tight. What do I mean by that? If you look at the picture, the tablet just rests on this stand. One consequence is that you have a limit in terms of the angles you can use before your iPad falls. What happens when you say, click on the circle button of an iPad? Depending the iPad generation, the cover you're using, how your orient your iPad (specifically if you rest it horizontally), and how you press on the iPad's circle button, your iPad could fall off the stand; which kind of kills the whole point of it. To avoid this problem, you need to have your iPad standing in portrait mode, or you need to hold the iPad whenever you press the circle button to keep it from falling (one finger behind the iPad, and another finger to press the button). At the end of the day, this isn't a deal breaker for most people, just for me and my particular situation. (My parents aren't very careful especially with gadgets. I can just picture their iPad flying off this thing.)<br /><br />I reallywish there was a variant of this product that really held the tablet so it wouldn't fall. It would be great if it also managed to work with the tablet still in its own tablet case. Why? I wanted to put the iPad at near eye level (with the help of stuff like phone books to prop it up), so my parents wouldn't have to slouch while working with it.  I would pay for the extra cost.<br /><br />Packaging: I bought this product as a gift. Unfortunately its packaging is just a plain brown shipping box with a little sticker on it. Not exactly great when people open gift wrap. \\\\\"O wow, a brown UPS box!\\\\\"  Moreover, this is for an Apple product. For anything related to Apple packaging counts a great deal. (I'm wondering if the product designers or company management have ever even opened an Apple product? Even the cheapest Apple products have really awesome packaging.) I'd rather pay 5 or 10 bucks more to get better packaging. At least it should look decent on the outside. In general people who tend to buy Apple products are willing to pay more for quality. If this wasn't called an 'iPad stand' instead a 'tablet stand', this wouldn't be as big of a negative. Of course, if this isn't a gift you can just ignore everything I just said.<br /><br />[Misc]<br /><br />I received a defective version of this product. The stand would not lock it's pivot position, which is really really important for keeping the iPad stable. Some dial for tightening the position was stuck and I didn't feel like using pliers to try to free it. I didn't want to damage the product in any way. If this wasn't meant to be a gift, I probably would have tried that route. Anyways I didn't put this in either the good or bad points since it wouldn't be fair to either the manufacturer or people looking to buy it. This is one of the reasons that I ended returning it.<br /><br />[Summary]<br /><br />Good, well made product that should meet most iPad users needs with a few caveats. I'm just really surprised that this product hasn't made it on any reviews on the big websites or magazines. I guess they didn't bother to send reviewers free samples for good publicity?",

I made the transition from a B&N Nook to the Kindle in order to take advantage of 1) the internal light and 2) the capability of downloading books overseas, which I have need to do from time to time.<br /><br />Customers should know, however, that the lighting system is not perfect...at least, it is not as a homogeneous light distribution system as the Kindle ads might lead you to believe.  The way it works is that there are six LEDs (four embedded on the bottom, and one each on the bottom sides) that illuminate a thin sheet of fiber-optic that is positioned OVER the (in my opinion, superior) e-ink screen.  The goal is that the whole fiber-optic sheet would be evenly illuminated.  But, at least on mine and three others that I have seen in the batches shipped between 22-31 October 2012, the light distribution is somewhat uneven.  The four LEDs on the bottom, for example, leave a series of soft shadows extending into the first inch of the screen; these shadows look much like a mountain range.  On mine, as well, the light distribution in the upper-left quadrant of the screen is uneven.<br /><br />Neither of these problems bothers me too much, and I have adjusted quickly.  But, the customer should know that this is an area where Amazon has yet to perfect the new technology.  Nevertheless, until they do, I am enjoying thoroughly the ability to read anywhere at anytime without worrying about exterior lights or eye strain from back-lit devises.  Since receiving my Kindle Paperwhite on Tuesday (10/30/2012), I am nearly finished with the second book in Mark Berent's fantastic quintology on fighter pilots in the Vietnam conflict: [[ASIN:B001HN5J7S STEEL TIGER (Book II in the ROLLING THUNDER series) by Mark Berent]]  This series is a must read for aviation fans, or those interested in air combat or the operation of planes such as the T-38, F-100, F-105, and F-4 Phantom.",

I use a Kodak digital camera with a full frame SLR and Canon lenses and take raw images (about 12-14 MP). I use a 10 sec timer and wait for the image to be download to the disk before taking another photo. At the BR area I used two 1 GB Compact Flash cards from Kodak (made by Lexar) and a Lexar Platinum II 2 GB CF card. All three were bought from Walmart in Silver City, NM, in May 2006. I then moved to the Courthouse Rock area and put in a 2GB Ultra II San Disk CF card. The card was previously erased on my computer and then with quick format in my camera (space for 63 images). After two pictures the card said it was full. I continued to click for photos and a card error saying that that the image could not be saved. I tried several quick formats in the camera. Removing the battery or turning off the camera did not correct the problem. I then switched to the 8GB San Disk Ultra II CF card and had similar problems at first, but was eventually able to take several hundred photos although I have not evaluated them to see if they turned out. The two cards were bought from the Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Micro Center store in May 2007 although both have a copyright of 2004. Today was not excessively hot or cold.  With the first three cards I mentioned I have often taken 2 or 3 images in quick succession without any problems, but not with San Disk cards. Also the three cards have never given any problems on days below freezing or above 100 degrees. In 2003 when I first got my camera I bought two 1 GB and one 2 GB San Disk Ultra II CF cards. The 2 GB card held only 600 MB and was returned to San Disk. After a few months San Disk gave me a new 2 GB card (not used today). I will have to buy some more Lexar cards because I no longer trust the San Disk CF cards. I was trying to take panoramas and with the sun light changing the delays caused by the card problems made it difficult. I suppose that SanDisk sells higher grade cards because it knows that these cards are of low quality. Howard McPherson, Moab, Utah",

The bag fits them both comfortably and, I imagine the same would be true if I had the bigger 15\\\\\" macbook. It is super solid, good stitching and overall what you would expect from the makers of the \\\\\"Swiss Army knife\\\\\". There are lots of compartments for other items like your wallet, cell, phone, chargers, and even a \\\\\"Swiss Army knife\\\\\"! Although I would not recommend trying to take a knife on an airplane, there is a special little pouch for one, or something of similar size like, I don't know, pepper spray. Maybe tick-tacks, or nicorette (you should really quit). What I am trying to say is that the items you could put in the pouches are only limited by your imagination. Even though I can't travel on an airplane with a knife, I would not forgo the purchase of this bag because it has a special place to put one.  I would use my imagination to find something of equal size to put there. But enough about me, lets talk about the bag.<br /><br />It has nice zippers, really nice zippers. There are three zippers, but only the biggest compartment's zipper has a place to put a lock. Which is crazy, because if you are a thief you would just take the whole bag (which I would recommend if stealing weren't wrong, because this is such a crazy awesome laptop case) Although a little lock to keep out nosey friends and family isn't a bad idea. Or, if you are a spy, and have top secret plans or government documents, this would be a good bag to go \\\\\"incognito\\\\\" with. It totally doesn't look like a double agents laptop case, which makes it the perfect laptop case for an undercover agent. Plus there is that pouch for a knife!<br /><br />One other feature, is that is has a little place to hook your keys, which is nice. That way you always know where your keys are. The clip that you hook your keys (or anything, remember the imagination thing) is really cool. It's hard to explain, but it's got a little button you push, and then the ring \\\\\"opens\\\\\" and you can put keys on. Very nifty. The more I look at this bag the happier I am I bought it.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I am impressed and hope to enjoy many years of using this durable laptop case. By the looks of it's quality, I will most likely use this for future laptops when my current one is so obsolete that it is no longer usable.

This is your hard earned money. I came to find out that the product I bought was originally purchased from Microsoft then resold by a third party reseller here on Amazon, so Asus therefore refuses to stand by their policy and advertising to give out a keyboard dock. This isn't my responsibility! Amazon is quick to make their buck, Asus is quick to make their buck, Microsoft is quick to make their buck, and the reseller is too devious to properly advertise the fact they bought the item from an authorized retailer and just throwing everything back to Asus, who throws everything back to all the other parties. These people are lowlife greedy scumbags. This review will probably never get published because it contains the truth. How is the actual product? On a scale of one to ten, it's a solid eight. The operating system needs to be better supported and marketed. Just remember you are limited to applications in the Microsoft App store. It isn't so bad. 95% of what you buy something like this can be done on this tablet. I still think they should just give everybody the damn keyboard dock like they promised however. Typical Chinese manufacturer selling in the United States and skirting our UCC and warranty laws. You need a good unified media player with Windows 8 RT. You don't get one, but there is one out there (And more coming from what I gather). Microsoft are a bunch of idiot fools. You can do double or triple the amount of work, entertainment, and productivity on this tablet than Android, Chrome, or iOS (Apple is the worst greed monger on the planet and the worst liars, everything promised, NOTHING delivered). Anyway, they (Microsoft) will manage to mess up a great thing here one way or another (Like I said typical)and not get enough of a development and user community for their products and related products (Like this VIVOTAB RT).<br />So, in the end regardless of the price you're taking a big chance. Now, this honest evaluation isn't in my best interest, I own the product, I want to see it and Windows 8 RT succeed. But, after using computers and technology for over 30 years I know how these greed mongers think. So, you buy at your own risk. Please don't ever be so stupid or naive enough to believe these companies give a rat's behind about you. They don't. And they could honestly care less about the actual product. So, you buy something created solely to be manufactured in a sweat shop at slave labor wages, with the slim possibility it might prove useful and be supported, at an overblown price with companies who have NO INTENTION of standing behind their products or their corporate word.

I needed something that would allow my tablet to use Square card reader, then swivel so the customer could sign without ever picking up or touching the tablet. This worked perfectly. The bottom is nicely weighed so the unit stays planted (although I do wish it had a mounting option). The clamps on the left and right are made of a rubber material along with the dark grey circle between the clamps, ensuring no harm to your tablet while its clamped in. The base can rotate the entire tablet 360, the same way a person can swivel around in an office chair. And for even more versatility, the hinge that connects the top half to the lower half can flip your tablet to be viewed by someone opposite from you, which is perfect for over the tablet encounters.<br /><br />But looking at how the stand is set up, I can say I was one of the lucky ones. This stand probably wouldn't work with half of other tablets. The clamps that you see in the provided picture only slide out about an inch on each side, and are spring loaded. So whatever tablet that requires the clamps to stretch will fit nice and tight. However, like some iPad users here, when the iPad is in portrait mode (home button at the bottom), this doesn't stretch the clamps, leaving only the non slip rubber on the clamps to keep the iPad in place (thus the reason behind the 1 star reviewers complaint and loose iPads). I would think this is the case for only the iPad Air<br /><br />Trying to explain dimensions on something square could be confusing (height, width, and depth can be confused with one another) so here's a general rule for this stand- if one of your tablets dimensions is between 6.5-7.9 inches, then it would fit one way or another. The dimensions for a Nexus 10 are 10.4 x 7 x .4, so it would fit. Same with the iPad mini. However, the Kindle Fire HDX dimensions are beyond 7.9 inches or below 6.5, so it might not. Also, forget about having a case on while this tablet is clamped in. I recommend a full body plastic film protector, like Bodyguardz or Skinomi<br /><br />But all in all, the stand works perfect for my needs, and makes my business look very professional for a low price. And as many people have said after searching forever, its the only one of its kind at this pricet about having a case on while this tablet is clamped in.

This laptop is a pure beauty. I keep turning it over to look it from different angles. The gorilla glass is soft to the touch and just feels really nice. The aluminium board feels really nice too. I can't tell if the bottom piece is metal or plastic, but it feels sturdy. The screen is incredible to behold.<br /><br />2) Hardware. The keyboard is pretty good. Maybe it's just that I type too fast and am imprecise, but I do miss some keys/they don't recognize the strokes. The touchscreen is a joy to use, and very precise. The trackpad is OK. My last computer was a mac, so anything is inferior to their trackpads. Needless to say, it recognizes 1,2, and 3 finger motions very well. Skips around a little bit, and if I touch it too close to an edge then either the charms menu or the app menu-thing pops up. Very happy overall, however. Many other reviews mention the fact that the keyboard is 5 deep, not six. I did not think this would be a problem, but it is a little annoying now. What is especially frustrating is that to turn the volume up or down I have to use the function key, and BOTH hands, because my hand (and I doubt anyone else's) will stretch from one side of the keyboard to the other. Again, going back to the mac, it was nice having dedicated volume, mute, and play/pause keys.<br /><br />3) Miscellaneous.  The mysterious port on the right side (some people say it's a minidisplay port, others a acer proprietary port) works as a minidisplay port. At least it does for me. The 128 gigs fills up wicked fast. The fan is absolutely silent. I haven't played any games or done anything intense with the computer, but so far it hasn't gotten hot on the underbody at all. Warm, yes, but not hot.<br /><br />Overall this is a five star computer. I am extremely happy with my purchase, and love my new computer.

At first, everything looked like my super old LCD monitors, jagged edges and blurry. I had to upgrade my graphics card for a higher end card that supports WQHD 2560x14400 resolution which seemed to not fix the issues. I was very frustrated, had second thoughts about my purchase, thought maybe I got a bad monitor and wanted to return it. That was until I went to the graphics cards manufacturers site and found that I need to use a different driver other that the one that came with the card. After getting the correct driver, the monitors graphics are amazing and breathtaking!<br /><br />I agree with another review about the speakers in that these are monitor speakers and they sound better than most, but they are still monitor speakers. If you are looking for superb sound quality and amazing bass then buy a set of nice speakers.<br /><br />I have been using Macs for quite some time and I have a Macbook Pro with a retina monitor. The quality is just the same for me without the glare PLUS you get more screen. I am extremely happy with this purchase and I am thrilled to have bought this for half the price of a Thunderbolt.",

I had taken the hard drive out of my PS3 and wanted to make it a storage unit. Thankfully the solution was posted online and it was easy to format it.     I was reading other reviews and someone was complaining about this weird clicking noise it can make. That comes from using the incorrect USB cable. When plugging in the unit you have to use the  USB cable it came with or it will not work properly. Also make sure the correct USB connector is plugged in. One is a primary and other is a secondary. Plugging in both USBs gives the unit more power, but I am not sure why anyone would need to do this.     If you are thinking about buying one go for it.

It also protects the Kindle well and keeps it firmly in place, while providing the extra bonus of creating a more book-like feel.

There are many particulars that may determine what may or may not make a great tablet.  And it doesn't matter what you think they are when considering this tablet because... the power connector is an old-school barrel aka \\\\\"tip\\\\\" connector that barely makes contact, or doesn't make contact if moved only slightly.  There is no light to indicate that it is charging, and if you look at the icon on any of the screens to verify that it is charging it is not good enough... after you set it down even very gently- this is enough to have moved the connector in a way that it will lose contact and stop charging.  I had this about a week and two nights I left it plugged in and it didn't charge because of this.  I checked two display models at the store and they did the same thing.  It is unacceptable... unfortunately it is basically useless because of this.<br /><br />If you want a good tablet, with a Wacom digitizer, windows 8 and good battery life--- I say go with the Thinkpad tablet 2 by Lenovo.

I gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading.  I liked both of them and I have to tell you that they have held up very well.  One is over 3 years old and the other is 2 years old and I have not had any issues with them.  Since I have not upgraded in 2 years I thought I would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster CPU and a higher resolution display. There are many improvements beyond even those features.<br /><br />I have to tell you that overall I am impressed with this new one.  I didn't feel the need to purchase a Kindle Fire every year and when I purchased the next one I wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what I had.  I stayed with the 7 inch size as I like to portability and weight for long term reading.  I alternate between the Kindle Paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and I use the Kindle Fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email.  This new Kindle Fire HD 2014 version is very fast and easy to use.  Setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze.  I like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books.  The higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older Kindle Fires we own.  The screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older Kindle Fires.<br /><br />I like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera.  I use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and I own many Apple iPads, Apple iPhone and Android tablets.  The camera is just handy for that spontaneous photo or video and I take a lot of them.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the stereo sound output has been improved as I listen to a lot of books.  I use the text to speech feature a lot and I also use the Audible book feature a lot.  When Amazon sells the Audible version of the book at a good price when I buy the Kindle version of the book I usually get both.  I like to use Bluetooth to stream the Audio book to my car's stereo system and listen to the book while I drive, especially on a long trip.  My wife and I enjoy listening to books together.  This HD tablet pairs with my car and I can now use it instead of using my iPad or using my iPhone.  This feature keeps track of where I am in the book regardless of whether I am reading the book or listening to it with Audible.  The better speakers and louder volume is also nice when watching movies.<br /><br />The unit works well handling my emails and it makes it nice that I can switch from browsing, to emails to reading or playing an app on the same tablet.  I also have Amazon Prime so I can watch TV shows or movies.  This is a good tablet with a lot of flexibility.  I am still not a fan of the push ads but I am so used to them now I just ignore them.<br /><br />I won't discuss all of the specifications but I did include a table comparing the Original Kindle Fire to the first Kindle HD 2013and now the Kindle HD 2014.  For me it was a quantum leap to go from a Kindle Fire First or Second Generation and I am glad I made the jump.  This tablet is a good buy for the money as the specs are very good.  The table below shows the differences between the different versions and you can see the progress that has been made in just a few years.  I am buying this new kindle with confidence as my last two Kindle Fires have performed very well and I expect the same out of this one.<br /><br />One word of caution is that if you are buying this for a child then make sure to pay attention to the parental controls.  Turn off the ability to make In App Purchases (IAPs) and I also turn off 1 touch buying.  It is so easy for a child to make in app purchases and some of them can be as much as $99.99 on one item.  Children are used to playing games with fake money and they cannot tell the difference and you will be surprised when you get the massive credit card bill.  A few minutes of proper set up of the tablet for use by a child can save you a lot of headaches in the future.<br /><br />There are a couple of features that I do wish were in this product that I miss. I own and have tested many tablets and I love the ability of Android tablets to accept a Micro SD card memory addition.  I even have some tablets that I use 128 GIG SD cards in and this is a great feature. A very good Micro SD card only cost $100 and if Amazon would add this feature this very good tablet would be a GREAT tablet. The second feature is the ability to easily use apps from the Google Play Store. Most of the office and game apps are on the Amazon play store and I really do like the Amazon Play store the best. There are though some powerful tools on the Google Play Store that will not work on the Kindle Fire Operating system and that is a shame. This limits the customer from being able to use the best available software available.  This Kindle Fire HD 2014 is a wonderful top notch product but it would be a superior product if these features were included.<br /><br />If you are upgrading from a first or second generation Kindle Fire then this is a great move.  For someone that has the 2013 Kindle Fire HD this is a smaller leap in technology so you may have to really want one of the new features to upgrade.  I like my new unit and I am glad that I got it.  I am also glad that it came with the AC wall charger in the box.  I rated it at 5 stars and recommend it based on the results I have seen so far.  If you have any questions please send me a comment and I will try to answer you.<br /><br />Feature:------------Original Kindle Fire----Kindle Fire HD 2013-----Kindle Fire HD 2014<br />CPU------------------Dual core---------------Dual core a5 1.5 GHz---Quad Core with dual<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.5 GHZ and dual 1.2<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------GHz cores<br />RAM--------------------------------------------------------------------------1 GB RAM<br />Internal Memory---8 GB----------------------8 or 16 GB------------------8 or 16 GB<br />Available Memory-5 GB-----------------------5 GB or 12.2GB------------5 GB or 12.2GB<br />Display--------------7 Inch--------------------7 Inch-----------------------7 Inch<br />DPI-------------------169 DPI 1024/600-----216 DPI 1280/800----------216 DPI 1280/800<br />Cameras------------None----------------------None------------------------Front & rear facing<br />Camera pixels-----N/A------------------------N/A--------------------------VGA quality front<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2 Mega Pixel Rear<br />Battery Life--------8 hours--------------------up to 10 hours--------------8 hours<br />Charging time----4 hours---------------------under 6 hours---------------under 6 hours<br />AC wall charger--yes included-------------Yes Included-------------------Yes included<br />Speakers-----------dual stereo speakers---dual stereo speakers--------dual stereo speakers<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------virtual surround sound<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------emulated 5.1 sound field<br />Display screen--------------------------------------------------------------Gorilla glass<br />Case colors----------Black------------------------Black--------------------5 colors available<br />Microphone---------None------------------------None--------------------Built-in<br />Operating system--------------------------------Fire OS 3.0------------Fire OS 4<br />WIFI--------------------Yes------------------------Yes------------------------Yes<br />Sensors----------------Accelerometer, gyroscope in all versions<br />Size---------------------7.5\\\\\"x4.7\\\\\"x0.45\\\\\"----------7.5\\\\\"x5\\\\\"x0.45\\\\\"--------------7.5\\\\\"x5\\\\\"x0.4\\\\\"<br />Weight-----------------14.6 ounces---------------12.2 ounces----------------11.9 ounces<br />Ports--------------------Micro USB Charging----Micro USB Charging-------Micro USB Charging<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------or use adapter HDTV or VGA<br />Volume Switches-----No--------------------------Yes------------------------Yes<br />Bluetooth--------------No---------------------------Yes----------------------Yes plus BT microphone compatible<br />Audio output---------all versions with 3.5 mm stereo jack<br /><br />What's new!<br />* Links your account to your family so you can share apps, books, audio books and games and Prime instant video content.<br />* Each user can have their own profile page with email, Facebook and twitter accounts.

So it is possible that the antenna was damaged through shipping and was returned as so, but I will not be buying another one due to the overall lack of quality and performance seen during testing.<br /><br />I already own a Swann Wireless 9DBI/13DBI (box says 9, the actual antenna is labeled 13) Yagi which was hoping to replace to gather some more signal. Upon of the receipt 18dbi unit my initial impression was this thing was built like a piece of crap.  The elements are not riveted and are punched in to place.  The shipping had two of them loose and many others seemed to be loose but hadn't yet moved but could spin touched.  The antenna ring that the coax goes into is junky in construction consisting of mostly plastic and doesn't have the shrink wrapped element like my swann or other I have seen on amazon. Once the antenna was mounted and properly aimed, I couldn't even pull in my weak signal the other antenna sees.  I would have to agree with the other reviewer and say the power of this antenna is grossly overstated. This isnt' to say it doesn't totally work. I could still see other access points but they had lost several bars in contrast to the Swann unit.<br /><br />Pay just a little more and get the browning yagi antenna ([[ASIN:B003YL5WJG Browning 2.4 GHz - 2.5 GHz Enclosed Cellular Yagi Antenna]]); Name brands tend to have a little more realistic specifications.<br /><br />I also didn't receive any other parts except the u-bolts, none of the brackets that were pictured came with my antenna.

These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.<br /><br />I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.",

Many people complain about the PC using the headset as audio device as long as the dongle is inserted, even though the headset is off! I agree, but you can easily adjust your audio settings. I am on PC. In your control panel, make your other audio device(say your default sound card) your default audio and so programs don't pick the logitech wireless automatically. Only customize your chat programs, say skype, to use this device. this way, you can listen to music on from your speakers and use the headset for chat or internet calling.    The only piece that ticks me off is the fact that batter is not replaceable! For such a high price, I would not expect customers to have to through it away just because the battery has died.

            "input": "Lightwave:  First Impressions<br /><br />Here in this forum, I want to give my impression of what it is like to own my first higher end 3d modeling, rendering and animating software.  The price is quite more expensive than other modelers I have owned.  In this forum, I have reviewed such modelers as TrueSpace and Carrara and I have never paid more than a couple hundred dollars for any modeler, animator, renderer or any 3d software.<br /><br />So what do you get for nearly $1,500 ?<br /><br />Answer, if you are looking for just a basic modeler, renderer and animator, you can do the same or better with any of the less expensive modelers.  Feature for feature, you can often find many of the same features and more in software packages such as Carrara, Blender, Art of Illusion, TrueSpace, Amapi, all of which I have and absolutely love, and many of these modelers you can get absolutely free of charge.  Carrara 8 (I have the 64 bit version, the more expensive version, called the Professional version) costs hundreds of dollars rather than thousands and has a huge array of features.  But there is, of course, the prestige of owning a higher end modeler, and even this is certainly not the highest end modeler especially when compared with Autodesk 3D Studio Max, and Maya which can run $3000 to $5000 for a single license.  But, like the high end software packages, this software does have the prestige.  This is one that is used by the &#34;big boys&#34;; high end studios, such as Walt Disney, Lucas Film, and many others.  This software is used in major motion pictures and television programs for the realistic animations and for many of the special effects you see in movies.  If you see it in the movies or on television, chances are it was 3D Studio Max, Maya, or Lightwave that it was created and rendered in.<br /><br />And this software is built with big studios in mind, rather than for a single one man ( or woman) studio, although a single person can certainly use the software.You are paying for the capability of running up to nearly 1000 cores of processing power for complex animation renders.  You are paying for the name and the marketability of the things you can create with this software.  If you go to a professional modeling website which sells high quality meshes for professional studios, you don't find much with the .cob TrueSpace format, or .car for Carrara, or even .cr2 for Poser formats.  Most models are sold in .max or .3ds, formats which are 3D Studio Max and in .lwo and .lws format with is Lightwave format, and there are a few other formats, such as .fbx -- all high end modelers.  You are paying for big studio power and level of professionalism.<br /><br />The Lightwave software package comes with two parts.  The Layout program, where you assemble all your modeled objects to create a scene, rig characters (that is, give them skeletons, for animations), and render single images and/or movies, and add special effects.  The second part is the Modeler, where you actually do your modeling, where you can create figures and objects from scratch, edit existing objects, apply texturing (although you can also do this in the Layout program too.), and build basic skeletons for figures.  These are actually two separate programs, but you can link them together with something called a Hub program where you can switch between programs, send finished models to the Layout from the Modeler, and synch them together.  Most other modelers, on the low end, such as Carrara, have modeler, layout, and rendered all integrated together in a single program.  Again, since this software is made for major studios, this type of system makes sense, since a major studio would likely have a single team using the software for building the models, and another team for doing the actual building of the scene and another team for the actual animations and special effects.  They would only use the particular program that is suited for the job they would do.<br /><br/>People who have older versions will know that in order to use the full features of the software that you had to have a special key called a dongle.  This served primarily as an anti piracy device, since you cannot use the software unless you have a legal registry number and the dongle as a sort of key.  The dongle was a device that you could install into a USB port, and as long as you had the key in the computer, you could use the software and all of its features.  But in the newer versions (I think above 11.3) the dongle has been discontinued, and all you need now is just the license number and to register your copy of the software.  But you have to register to actually get the license number.  The serial number you get with the software, if you get CD or DVD is not the same as the license number.  So registering and activating your software is a little more involved.<br /><br />I bought the original disk media version which was the 32 bit version of Lightwave 11.0, and registering it and using the dongle was a bit of a nuisance.  But when you go to register your software and make an account online with NewTek, as long as you have Lightwave 11.0 or above, you can get a free upgrade to the latest version of Lightwave, which is, as of this writing, 05/31/2014, Lightwave 11.6.  I downloaded and got the 64 bit version for use with my computer.<br /><br />Lightwave 11.6 has all the latest features, including enhancements on its special effects machine, such as hypervoxels, which are similar to metaballs, but more dynamic.  You can use these for such things as flamethrower effects, dynamic explosive effects, liquid effects and so forth.  It also introduced soft body and cloth simulators, which the earlier 11.0 version did not have, in addition to its hard body dynamics and physics engines .  You also have dynamic hair and fibers, morph targets, and skeleton editing, and kinematics and inverse kinematics.  There is also more import and export capability.  You can import .fbx (Filmbox) and .dae (Collada) objects and a couple of other mesh formats into either the Layout or Modeler, .3ds, .max, .dxf , .obj, or many other popular formats.  You have a little more export capability, and you can export to .3ds, .obj, and .dae, and a few other formats.<br /><br />I have been going through the .pdf manuals and playing around with the software, and here I will give my first impressions of it.<br /><br />The interface is pretty straightforward in both the Modeler and Layout. And you can quickly find features and can often guess without too much thought what some things do.  Unlike many modelers, Lightwave is more menu driven rather than icon driven.  In other words, you can actually read what the buttons actually do instead of trying to figure out by the image what a button does.<br /><br />The Modeler appears to be primarily a polygon modeler with emphasis on subdivision techniques.  (Some modelers specialize in a particular type of modeling.  Some modelers, for example, specialize in NURBS or spline curves for creating objects, others specialize in subdivision, some modelers can model in a wide range of modeling techniques including both subdivision and NURBS, some are sculpting modelers, etc.)  But you can draw and create spline curves for use with such things as lathing and extrusion.  And you can create NURBS like patches with the spline curves, by joining curves together and building a series of polygons between them.  And metaballs and metaball like objects are supported.  There is something called a &#34;metaedge&#34; tool in which you can create metaball type objects of various shapes.<br /><br />Of course, it comes with basic tools for modeling objects, including drawing tools, spline curves are already mentioned, Bezier curves, simple polygons, etc.  There are various types of extrusion tools.  Path extrusion is supported as well as lathing.  It has a rather comprehensive list of point editing tools, a few I have never seen before, such as a stencil tool, which can create on a polygon surface a polygon version of text, logos, symbols, artwork, etc, this in lieu of using a texture map or a decal.  Of course, you can move position, rotate, and size entire objects or parts of objects, including faces and polygons, edges, and points (vertices).  There are twist, bevel, tools.  You can create text objects.  Booleans are supported.  There is a whole range of polygon, point, and edge manipulation tools where you can add, delete edges, faces, points, and modify geometry in various ways.<br />Subdivision modeling is fully supported with two basic types and various types of smoothing geometry tools, as well as tessellation, and triangulation tools.<br /><br />UV mapping and other types of texturing tools are supported and allow a wide range of manipulation of surfaces for figures.  And there is also a painting tool for doing various tasks such as weight painting for skeleton figures, to adjust the influence of bones on a mesh and surface color painting.<br /><br />&#34;Skelegons&#34; is what lightwave calls its rigging tool, which is used for making skeletons or bones of animated characters.  &#34;Luxigons&#34; is a tool used to turn all or parts of polygon objects into luminous objects i.e. light sources.  &#34;Powergons&#34; can be used to execute various tasks using polygon objects such as manipulating lights, etc.<br /><br />You can create complex hierarchical objects in the modeler, which Lightwave calls &#34;layers&#34;.<br /><br />The Layout program is just what its name implies.  It is where you create your layout.  You and insert objects that have already been modeled and arrange them and create a scene.  This is also where you can do final setup of animated characters, pose them, animate them, and so forth.  This is also where you can create particle effects, to create such things as smoke, fog, fire, and the like.  We have already mentioned hypervoxels and physics effects.  It also has a flocking tool, which for animations, simulates the actions of large groups of objects, such as a flock of geese, or a herd of elk, or a squadron of fighter planes.  I have not yet tried any of these tools yet, so I cannot yet say how these work or how realistic the effects are.  The Layout is also where your renderer is located.<br /><br />The renderer is first rate.  It is certainly capable of absolute photorealism.  I loaded preset scenes of a model car and World War II planes into the Layout room and rendered it using just basic settings.  Even in basic settings Lightwave rendered the scene very realistically.  There is a reason why Lightwave is used for professional movies and television.  The renders are certainly the kind you can use in movies and television.  The renderer supports lens flares, caustics (light through transparent objects,) radiosity (diffuse light), shadows, soft shadows, ray tracing, reflections, refraction.<br /><br />I have only started to work with this software, so I am still very new to it.  But this is my first impression of it.  I will provide updates and revisions as I learn more about this software and begin using it.<br /><br />One last word, if you are new to 3D modeling, you will need to look for tutorials, if you want to know how to build objects in 3D.  I myself have some experience in modeling, and learned much about modeling just by playing with this and other 3D software, so I never needed much with tutorials, although for TrueSpace, when I first started learning modeling, I did get Frank Rivera's book on TrueSpace (reviewed in this forum), as a sort of tutorial to help learn some aspects of that software and 3D modeling in general.  But if you are the sort that needs some pointers, the Lightwave site and a few other sites have tutorials that will help you get started in learning how to do modeling.  I think there are tutorial books on Lightwave as well.  The .pdf manuals, that come with the software cover the tools and theiruses, but the manuals do not contain much instruction as to how to model objects.",

I like to draw, but for fast, precise drawing - the feel of the bamboo was not as responsive as I would want.    The pen itself has an excellent feel in your hand overall. Nice heft. Well balanced, and at least an inch longer than the Boxwave - which means it fits better in a larger hand.  The clip comes off in case you just want a nice sooth cylinder. The clip even can be mounted in the opposite direction to achieve more length.    The drawing end of the stylus is nicely machined, and unscrews to reveal a removable rubber tip. One can use it with the end unscrewed and the tip fully exposed too.    Here's the bad part for me: Out of the box, the tip feels too sticky, and squishy. It gives too much. Initially it felt sluggish compared to the boxwave's responsiveness. So, I took it off, and stuffed it with a tiny bit of sponge (Mr. Clean Magic Eraser), and Voila! The tip is now firmer, and it glides better on the surface of the iPad. I decided that I should order some more rubber nibs. However, it was impossible to find them on the Wacom site -- for some reason they have the nibs hidden? Anyway I called Wacom and the sales rep told me to enter ACK20501 into the search box on the wacom.com site. 3 nibs for 5 bucks plus 5 bucks shipping. I'm going to experiment with stuffing the nibs with different materials to achieve the exact feel I like.     Wacom should produce tips/nibs with varying material densities, and feels.

The iPad was my second computing device - I had a laptop, but I needed something lighter and with longer battery life to lug around from meeting to meeting. The iPad fit my needs, except for the terrible file management choices that Apple made, which make routine tasks like adding (non-picture) attachments to an email reply almost impossible.<br />Enter Asus T100. At least on paper, this has everything that I needed: small size, physical keyboard, long battery life, and an operating system that pays attention to productivity driven users.<br />What I like about it:<br />- battery life is as expected, when using the device<br />- the core Windows experience is still there. Boring, but it gets out of the way for productivity tasks, unlike iOS7<br />- touch screen laptops are the way of the future.<br /><br />What I dislike:<br />- software integration isn't Asus / Microsoft's strong suit. You have to put up with random annoyances like the the volume overlay not disappearing off the screen once you're done with it, or the software keyboard appearing on screen even when the physical keyboard is connected.<br />- I've also encountered more serious bugs, like the physical software going AWOL - turning itself off. To get it back - a machine reset was necessary.<br />- the thing that's really disappointing is that in spite of the long battery life, the Asus / Microsoft combo hasn't quite mastered the standby. This thing would be dead in 24 hours, whether I use it or not. My iPad could last on standby for weeks.<br />- the Windows 8 split personality. Two applications for OneNote, both fighting for control of my notes. In general, the metro style apps are a bit too design oriented, and sometimes that does get in the way of their functionality.<br />- What good is being able to touch the screen, if I can't pinch to zoom? Most Windows programs support this, but on a 10 inch device, you really need this. Chrome (the web browser) does not support pinch to zoom, which basically makes it unusable. Pity, because IE (both versions) are not as good.<br />- Asus bloatware. I keep ignoring their offers for backup and other useless stuff. I'd gladly pay a bit more to be left alone.<br />- Physical design is mediocre. Buttons can't be controlled by feel only (I've pressed the Windows button numerous types when I was trying to operate volume), the trackpad doesn't have any feel to it, the keys are uncomfortable (after using the Belkin keyboard for the iPad, I know it's possible to make a decent small keyboard)<br /><br />In the end, this does the job, but barely.

As a hub, it's everything I wanted and for a great price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The output port (the port that connects the hub to the computer) is a micro B usb, which anyone with an android tablet, phone, etc. know is a weakpoint would eventually wear out. I would've preferred a more reliable full size or mini port, but I do not plan to travel with the hub so in my personal situation does not detract from the rating.<br />In the picture, there's 3 bright spots on the light bar, on the unit I recieved, only 1 works reliably and the other one has a delay when plugging in (about 10 seconds). Very strange, but I don't care about the blue lighting as I do about it's functionality.<br />Having five ports on one side and 5 on the other inherently makes a full loaded hub look very messy.

The Kindle works great and is a huge space saver, which is needed since I live in Hawaii. I was reluctant at first to buy one since I prefer paper/hard copy books. I started looking at e-readers when Borders closed down. I checked out the nook, sony e-reader, and Kindle since my friends had them. I decided that the Kindle was best for me. The decision was a tuff one but since the e-readers I thought of buying was the color versions. After looking at there price I thought I was better off buying an iPad or tablet PC. So I saved money and went with the Kindle. I figured with buying a Kindle if I want to read in color or could just download the Kindle app for tablet PC's/iPAD. I already have the app for the iPhone and it works great. Long story short I have been using my Kindle all the time when I read. The Kindle has grown on me alot and now I don't buy paper books unless they are cheaper (which is almost never). Downloading books is alot easier than trying to find them in the store. I also enjoy that I saved 50.00 by getting the kindle with special offers. Just to be clear they never pop up when reading. The offers show up as wall paper and at the bottom of the books screen. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to read books since its light weight, easy to travel with, and reads perfect under the sun. I also recommend the case with a light so you can read at night with no problems (thats of course you have the lights off in your house). It reads under any light.",

First I plugged the dongle into a port on a USB hub, inserted the driver cd, and installed it.  The \\\\\"gesture\\\\\" functions worked erratically or not at all.  I contacted the manufacturer twice, through its website, asking for help but received no reply.  It eventually worked after many hours of trying different things (and screaming a lot).  To get it working on my Windows 7 machine:  1) used the Device Manager to remove all drivers  2) inserted dongle into a USB port on the computer, not on the hub  3) then Windows installed the default driver  4) used Device Manager again to remove the driver  5) manually ran the setup.exe program located in the Windows7 folder of the driver cd  It worked, but only on that particular USB port.  This process was repeated several times because inserting the dongle in different USB ports caused the \\\\\"gesture\\\\\" functions to not work again.  Maybe it is intuitive after all.  The device slips on a hard surface, such as a desk, which I fixed by attaching small rubber pads to the bottom.  It worked properly and immediately on a notebook pc running Windows XP.  I would give the device itself a five star rating.  But I gave it a 3 due the trouble installing the driver and lack of manufacturer's response.",

I wish I could get the identical product in cordless, but I haven't seen it anywhere (If someone knows of one, just like this one, that's cordless, let me know! I've seen similar, but not the same.)<br /><br />Okay, the downside: after about a year, each time I have bought one of these for my main laptop that I used daily, the USB plug has stopped work, where you have to wiggle it to get it to work for a while, then it finally give out. The good news: Logitech has given me a free replacement twice when it was within a year of purchase, just mailed it right to me, in the box, brand new. I didn't even have to return the broken one. The third time it happened, it was after a year, but Logitech sent me a coupon for a significant discount off the purchase price. You can't beat that kind of support of their product, so be sure to save your receipt to prove purchase. I don't think you'll have the same problem as I have had though, since I literally use this mouse for about 10-12 hours per day, nearly 7-days per week for my work and personal stuff. I have three of them for three different computers.<br /><br />The way it allows your hand to sit still instead of having to move to mouse helps prevent wrist pain, and using the thumb to click with barely any movement at all is nice. The track ball can be moved with your fingers, whichever ones you like, and I've found the mouse to be super responsive. I can rest my hand over the mouse, and the shape of the mouse naturally curves to the shape of the hand, so I barely have to move any fingers or my thumb to use the mouse--which for someone who is on the computer as much as I am, saves a lot of repetitive stress on the hands and wrist, and helps with some of my health issues.<br /><br />It does take an adjustment period and I'll admit it's tough for me now to use other people's computers who don't have this mouse, because I'm so accustomed to it. But for the price, for saving the wear and tear on my hands, I just can't say enough good about this product. If you do buy it, don't give up on it right away after getting it. Give yourself some time to get used to it, because I think once you do, you'll be like me and won't want to go back to a regular mouse or a mousepad again!<br /><br />Oh, besides it being corded as a downside, I should mention that after time, the little rubber feet that keep it from sliding do wear off or fall off. I simply went to the hobby store and bought new ones to replace them, for about 60 cents. Really not a big deal to me.se, because I'm so accustomed to it.

After receiving the new router, we found that this one had the same issue. The wireless wasn't working. We're not sure if it was an issue with Windows 7 support or what... But we requested another one, and they sent it.  Finally, the third one worked. No settings were changed, we were just sent 2 routers that had wireless issues. While Medialink as a company for their excellent support deserves 5 stars, the product, unfortunately, did not measure up to my standards of an easy to set up router that would cause no problems.",

I have this USB in one place only; it is used as a alternative storage drive and is never moved. I am stating this because I am aware that regular docking and transport of a memory drive will incur potential shock and damage. With that being said, I tried to transfer the saved information from the original location to another but the device broke for the second time and could not be recognized by the computer. I lost the information and now I'm out those $20 because it broke at two months which is outside of the acceptable return time frame.

SO what do I not like.<br /><br />First off I think the fan vents are in the wrong place... When I use it as a tablet I want to be holding it by the battery bump in my left hand...  This means that the fan vents are pointing into my lap/chest when holding it close to me.  I think they should go out the side where the charger plugs in.<br /><br />Second the default values for the tilting of the screen when you swipe a circle with your finger are opposite for me... so I had to change the settings in the video options for page up and such to do what I wanted... not a biggie...<br /><br />But the MAIN PROBLEM which is purely cosmetic is that the top outside of the case with the display has started to lose its paint along the edge.  It is where my hand grabs the case to close it... I suspect that perhaps chemicals probably suntan lotion or other has caused the paint to warp and crack.  YUCK.

It is a very heavy and solid mount and it moves well and smoothly thoughout the range of motion.  As I recall it was possible to tighten up the joints, but it wasn't necessary with this light monitor.  Cable management was respectable as well.  While this product may seem a bit pricey it is worth the money and other qaulity mounts are close to or higher than this price point. I would recommend this product and would buy again.

The previous wireless device I had connected to this computer worked very poorly in this location -- the Netgear adapter works great.  It is also much smaller than you might think from its picture.  It is about the size of a deck of playing cards.<br /><br />My only criticism of this adapter would be the somewhat poor instruction sheet.  Anyone unfamiliar with computers and wi-fi connections would have a tough time setting this up if their router has wi-fi security enabled and you do not have a WPS-type router.  If using WEP security you need to specify if it is 64 or 128 bit encryption. You also have to specify your router's HEX key.  To set up other wireless devices in my home, like my wi-fi enabled bluray players, the connection is made with an ASCII key.  But this Netgear device requires a HEX key.  It took me a little while to figure this out because it also asks for a password, but once I entered my router's hex key and used the ASCII key for the password I was in business.<br /><br />This is a very low-cost way to add wireless internet access to another room in your home.

Luckily returned to Amazon within the 30 day window.  Second one was stable but this brings us to the bigger problem with both of them.  The casing on the units is not attached at the connector end.  When inserting cables ( even gently) the force required to overcome the friction with the socket and the cable end will flex open the seam on the unit.  In part because it doesn't align properly to begin with on the jacks.  After 3-4 times of plugging in the power cord the socket, which is only attached to the unit by the surface mount solder joints on the circuit board detached and now I have a paper weight.  The jack should have been attached with a peg, screw or tab that went through the board to anchor it.  Otherwise it would never stand up to very many insert and removal cycles.

I had some bubbles formed right after application but I was able to squeeze them out using an old applicator (or use the edge of a clean plastic credit card).<br /><br />This screen protector is made of high-quality Japanese films.

My main concern with a product like this is that it works, and it certainly does.  I may even have to buy another one soon, just for more ports!  One other feature that I thought was well thought-out was that there are no inputs or outputs on the rear of the box.  All ports (including power) are located on the sides and top of the box.

This keyboard doesn't work during the restart; so when I switch to Windows, I have to attach the USB keyboard.  I'll look into installing Parallels to resolve that problem.<br /><br />I paid $40 to Amazon for this keyboard, while the price in the stores is between $70-80.<br /><br />I don't know about battery life;  I assume I'll have to replace them every 8-10 weeks, according to the manual.

You do get what you pay for, the Trio is only as good as your wifi and internet connection.<br /><br />I do play games like angry birds, wordsmith, words with friends and others and have no problem with any. I also have facebook and skype and they both work well. I can view youtube but it can be slow at times. The sound is low but with a headset or ear buds the tablet comes alive. I added AndCad and it works great. The pinch and zoom works great and responds well. The camera and video quality are low but still work well and I have not seen the \\\\\"green\\\\\" pictures others mention. I have dropped this tablet three times twice on hardwood floors and once on carpet and it still works fine. The app stores that come with the tablet work well and you can add others as well just not been able to add google play store.<br /><br />In summary: If you want a good large tablet that holds up and gives you access to social media, online news, music, games, books, searches for anything and everything online, front and rear camera, usb connection(s), HDMI connection, headphones, and an Micro SD card slot then the Stealth is a good cheap alternative. If it gets broken, stolen, or lost I would only be out $130 versus a much more $300-$500+ to replace and repair for the others.  I would definitely buy it again once they add a bit more speed and better cameras.<br /><br />I give it a 4 out of 5 since it does meet my needs and the price can not be beat but if the video speed and sound were improved it would be a 5 easily.",

But, if you're like me, with a workhorse on the desk, and you're on the move a lot, you can't beat this Chromebook. It's essentially a web browser that you hold in your hands and can take anywhere. Though it's great for keeping up on email, Facebook, reading, or just surfing, I wouldn't use this machine to do any serious work. Sure, you can view/edit/share files with the integration between Google Docs and Drive, but working with large, complex files can be a pain when you're stuck inside a web browser.<br /><br />This little machine perfectly fills the gap between using a less responsive phone and the primary machine with all the expensive software. Great for taking to classes, or while travelling for work. It's snappy both in booting and while running. Video and audio quality is just fine, if perhaps a bit too quiet at times. Keyboard is visually appealing, very comfortable, quiet, and responsive. The lack of a delete key, is off-putting, however. The touchpad takes quite a bit of getting used to - I had to dramatically adjust scrolling speed so that a small swipe didn't send you instantly to the bottom of a page. Battery life is excellent; it's definitely an all-day machine without being perpetually tethered to a wall. I usually get about 6 hours of constant use before I need to plug in. The OS is wonderfully secure and worry-free, and the user interface is very clean and simple, yet looks great. The frame is very sturdy, as are the hinges.<br /><br />My only serious complaints are that you're limited to a small set of provided wallpapers, and the necessity of an internet connection to truly be able to use the machine. A little overpriced, in my opinion, but I'm absolutely willing to pay the premium for a great little machine that vastly outperforms a similarly priced netbook or laptop.",

I was concerned when I read that (after I placed the order and before I recieved it) but having used it I can say the delay is at most 2 to 5 seconds. Not really a big deal and very acceptable considering the fact it is using USB.     If your looking for a USB KVM this is the way to go. The sound option is great.    In case anyone is wondering it comes with 4 sets of cables. Each set includes two audio cables colored ping and green for mic and speakers on both ends and one cable that looks like a standard VGA connection on one end (this part connects to the KVM) and has a VGA connection on the other end and a USB connection (this is the end the connects to the pc).

They have a relatively small living room, so a huge unit was not really necessary.  After doing some research, I chose this unit based on some favorable reviews, and that it sounded like it would fit their needs.<br /><br />They are not super picky about sound, but they expect decent sound.  I on the other  hand, am somewhat of an audiophile.<br />My wife sits somewhere in the middle.........she is somewhat discriminating on her sound, and expects speakers to sound lush and not tinny.<br /><br />So here's the thing.  We took the unit over to their house and I hooked it up for them.  My daughter-in-law plugged her iPod into the port on top of the unit, and began to listen. She listens to current bands, such as One Republic.  Right off the bat, I noticed that the sound on this Craig speaker was tinny.  We turned the unit up, and I adjusted the bass to level 3.  Immediately, we encountered vibration and creakiness (that's the best description I can think of) from the cones.  You simply cannot turn the volume up very loud, without getting this negative vibration and sound.  We then tried it with just the television  sound.  We were disappointed that it basically provided no better sound, than you would get from a large television speaker.  Both my stepson and daughter-in-law were frustrated with the vibration, and the fact that you can't turn the unit up very loud without this occurring.<br /><br />This unit provides some bass, but it is limited.  There is not a subwoofer built in, so this is certainly a factor.  Nonetheless, I expected it to fill their small room with good sound without the obnoxious vibration that I have mentioned.  My wife told me later, that she was very disappointed with the sound that the Craig produced.  She and I were so embarrassed that we had given them a gift of this low caliber, that I immediately began shopping around for a better sounding speaker.  I have found one, and I am replacing this Craig speaker with a superior unit.<br /><br />I do not want to come off like I am snobby when it comes to  my expectations from a unit that is selling for basically a hundred dollars.  But let's face it.........when you purchase a speaker that gets pretty decent reviews, you expect it to perform admirably.  The Craig speaker may be just fine for some users who are not at all concerned with good sound (not to mention the ugly vibration). But for us, who run the gamut from not super picky, to very picky, this unit did not produce.  I am not associated with any electronics company, and I am not someone who is writing this negative review, in order to promote another product.  I do not like writing bad reviews, because it is not my nature to slam someone's product.  But I had to put in my two cents worth, because my experience with this Craig speaker, was nowhere near what some of the positive reviews indicated.  I would not recommend this unit.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read my review.",

It's also pretty comfortable despite its size.    Cons: Although the padding is generally very good, I think it could have used a little more on the bottom of the laptop compartment since that's where the hardest impacts occur but it's not bad. The bag can also be very heavy when it gets filled up but I suppose that's a con of physics more so than the bag itself.

I almost filled the entire 2TB and realized that my whole life is all backed up on one drive, so I purchased a second Passport to be a backup for my back up. The transfer speed is great and something that took 35 hours on USB 2.0 now only takes 5 or 6 hours. Now I feel secure that in case anything happens to my master backup, all my data is safe. I'm not afraid of the quality of the Passport, I'm afraid I might lose my Passport as it fits in my shirt pocket and I carry it back and forth to work and on business trips all over including overseas.

In addition it won't run anything google, you have to buy separate equipment to make it cast to the tv, and a lot of the apps I like are not compatible. Further, the wishlist button is not able to be added to the browser (which is especially dumb since it's an amazon tablet) and the only case that works with the auto sleep/wake feature is astronomically expensive and won't hold the tablet in place securely. I'm not a big technology person, meaning that I don't play games and don't need it to have optimum features and performance, but I do expect my devices to just work and work properly for basic functions and this just doesn't do that.

In the years since I have upgraded my components to a respectable level so I can play the latest games at 1080P. However, one thing I haven't changed is my gamepad setup. I've always been a keyboard/mouse kinda guy on PC, but one of the strong points of console gaming is a solid controller setup, which I feel Xbox has. I decided to try something new, and purchased this, i'm very glad I did. I've been using it for a few hours now and it's great. I prefer their controllers due to their comfort, button placement, and weight. They have a nice, sturdy weight to them as well, but as this is wired, it weighs less. These features translate well over into the PC version.    The controller's cable is pretty long so you could easily game across the bedroom with it, but it's a bit short for console usage.    It has nice response and the vibration feedback is nice! This controller works with almost every game in my Steam library (I mostly play first person shooters and racing sims) and if you're a fan of the console controller, this is a wise purchase to make as a PC gamer.     You can pick this up around $30, so it's fairly cheap in terms of the hours of fun you'll get with it. It's very durable, i've owned Xbox controllers for almost four years without anything happening to them, but I take good care of my possessions. This controller would make a great stocking stuffer for your teen kids, or for somebody who enjoys PC gaming, as well as technology.     I'm not really saying anything new here, but I'm really glad that I got this, as it brings a new light to PC gaming. The comfort, ease of use, and feature-rich experience it brings to PC gaming speaks for itself, and it's really like playing the games for the first time again. There's no learning curve to using this or installing it, just make sure you install the software drivers included on theCD in the box, and you're ready to go!",

            "input": "I have been seeking a fully-featured wireless mouse for the past two weeks and have finally found my optimum choice in the Logitech Wireless Mouse M510. The attributes I sought out included the following:    1) Full-size and ergonomic shape. I have fairly large hands, so most notebook mice cannot provide a sufficiently comfortable experience for long periods of usage time.    2) High battery endurance. I prefer a wireless mouse that minimizes battery replacement to improve overall convenience and reduce my dead battery collection.     3) Laser technology. A setting of at least 1200 dpi is necessary to track subtle movements, which are particularly important for graphical applications (i.e. solid modeling and photo editing software). Laser technology also allows for usage on most surfaces.    4) Inconspicuous wireless transmitter. I find great appeal in a low profile wireless transmitter, as it saves the user from having to remove the device from a notebook during travel.    While many other competing products from Logitech offer appealing features such as \\\\\"hyper scrolling\\\\\" and any-surface tracking a la \\\\\"Darkfield\\\\\", they each carry their own weaknesses as well. For example, I considered various notebook-class mice, including the Anywhere MX and the Marathon M705, yet as a person with fairly large hands, I determined that they were simply not large enough to use comfortably.       Notebook Mice:    With respect to the Anywhere MX, while its touted \\\\\"Darkfield\\\\\" technology and \\\\\"hyper scrolling\\\\\" are admittedly persuasive, does not appear to yield the battery endurance that I desire. The form factor is certainly far too small to permit the ergonomics my hands require.     In consideration of the Marathon M705, while it certainly has the battery endurance I desire, as well as \\\\\"hyper scrolling\\\\\", it still remains too small, and the price tag currently does not justify its purchase. The Anywhere MX (at the time of research) could be had for nearly the same price after rebate,and if I were to choose a less-than-comfortable mouse, I would be more inclined to compromise some battery life for features.      Full-Sized Mice:    Moving on to full-sized mice, I spent some time researching the Performance MX. The Performance MX touts a host of features, including a low-profile wireless transmitter, but I am not fully convinced that they justify the price. Furthermore, this device utilizes a cradle for charging, and I would prefer high endurance, which typically entails the exclusive use of AA or AAA batteries.     While researching this category, I came across the M510, which although it carries less features than the aforementioned products, represents the best compromise to the attributes I desire in a mouse. Notably, this mouse has a great form factor, and while not as large as the Performance MX, fits comfortably and ergonomically even for my larger hands. Admittedly, I would prefer that the mouse were a bit longer to fill out my palm, but in the manner I handle the mouse, comes very close to an ideal fit. Logitech claims battery endurance up to 2 years, which far exceeds my expectations, and reduces my reliance on spare batteries. The device uses laser technology, which actually does not perform optimally on my aluminum desk, but tracks perfectly on my microfiber mouse pad with high accuracy. I honestly did not expect the mouse to function well on my desk, so this is more of an observation than a concern. The device also includes the low-profile wireless transmitter, which overall adds to the convenience of the product, and lends itself to a more travel-worthy full-sized mouse. As an additional note, the forward and back buttons work perfectly, and are quite easy to access. Extra buttons that are actually usable certainly add greater value to this product.      Conclusion:    While this mouse certainly has less features than some of the competition, it can be had for a reasonable price, which from Amazon lies in the range of $30 to $40. The form factor is excellent, the battery life is sufficient, the accuracy is great, and the wireless transmitter is convenient. For those seeking a full-sized and ergonomic mouse that still affords some portability, the Logitech M510 is a great option, and should represent a serious candidate for any mouse-purchasing decisions.",

            "input": "PLEASE NOTE: This review is for the Small Alley Case for 13\\\\\" screens - not the Osprey Raptor Daypack.<br /><br />After taking the plunge to return to school, I found myself on the prowl for a new notebook; all the peripheral goodies to be purchased following in kind. A few weeks of research and product comparisons later, and I finally pulled the trigger by purchasing an [[ASIN:B005JCWSNQ ASUS U36SD-XA1 13.3-Inch Thin and Light Laptop - Black]]. Given the hardware, expected purposes, and personal preferences; the Small Alley Laptop Bag by STM Bags LLC seemed like the perfect choice. I'm about a week into ownership now and so far I'm very happy with my purchase decision.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Slim design, with vertical-carry: Minimizes the risk for an accidental broadside-bang into a chair, desk, car-door, toddler, etc. Further, the foam padding for the laptop compartment feels dense enough to add real structure to the bag, while thick enough to quell concerns about the inevitability of minor bumps and dings.<br /><br />* Durable: Mileage may vary, and I'll have to update after a longer period of use; but, the ripstop polyester outer-shell is waterproof and that's awesome. Similarly, most stitches and seams (outer and inner) appear to have been designed/implemented with consideration to actual reinforcement - not just to hold the thing together while it sits on a shelf somewhere. I should also note that another reviewer did say that the edges of his laptop got wet in the rain (due to the open-sided design of the flaps). I'd have to assume his laptop was larger than the recommended 13\\\\\", because mine managed to weather (Tee-hee!. . . sigh) a recent 100-yard dash across a parking lot during a significant downpour. The two protective flaps were securely Velcro'd down, keeping my new baby snug as a bug. I'll add a few customer images with references to the gaps just in case anyone wants a closer look.<br /><br />* Style: I'm a big fan of the minimalist design. I don't need a bag that communicates \\\\\"rugged-urban-outdoorsman-student-guy\\\\\". As well, I don't need 10 exterior pouches made from 10 different materials, with 10 different creatively-marketed functions and 10 different fasteners. I already have plenty of options to consider when I want to lose something smaller than a can of soda, but thanks! I will say that the interior does have a sufficient number of areas/pouches for a few standard items; plus, a small snap-detachable key-ring for a spare set of keys or anything else (USB drive) you might want to store, while not allowing it to shuffle around at the bottom of a pocket.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />* Slim design: I know, I know. I do really like the slim design of this bag, but once I neatly pack in my computer, power adapter/cords, mouse, portable hard drive, steno pad, and a few pens, the bag starts appearing as a slightly pregnant version of itself - kind of like an Olsen twin, somewhere around the beginning of her first trimester. If I didn't utilize e-textbooks for class, I can only imagine how I might find myself one day, enrolled in US History to 1877 and Intro to Psychology; peering at the bag's distended belly from across the room, face twisted in disgust as I try to work up the courage to blurt out that which would undoubtedly be turning over and over in my mind - \\\\\"You were so beautiful once, now look at you.\\\\\" - With such inevitably leading to, \\\\\"Maybe we should think about seeing other bags. . . \\\\\"<br />But again, I don't have the need to carry much more than I do now, so this point is largely moot; I just thought I'd offer the heads up.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this bag so far. 4 stars until I get at least 6 months to a year in and see how it holds out. Until then, I'm making a strong recommendation all the same. Thanks for reading, comments and questions are welcomed!<br /><br />*****12/05/2013 UPDATE*****<br /><br />5 stars it is. I carry this same shoulder bag daily, and am pleased to report that it has held up excellently. Apart from some very normal and quite minor wear (like small, loose threads here and there, as well as the white text wearing off of the rubber label found on the bottom-right of the exterior flap), the satchel is in remarkable shape.<br /><br />I should note that I don't tend to carry my laptop in this on a daily basis. However, I do use this to carry my Bamboo Create Pen + Touch pad, a portable hard drive, a few flash drives, some pens, steno pads, and some e-cig paraphernalia. To this, I haven't had anything break or malfunction do to regular carry/use, so I think that says something to the bag's basic functional build quality. I will try to update some pictures soon, but please feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best to reply promptly.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!s held up excellently.

            "input": "When I saw the specs for the laptop online ([...]) I was particularly impressed by the low price point for an i7 processor (i7 2630qm @ 2Ghz per core) equipped unit.     Yes, there are other laptops as of writing that carry a $700-$950 price tag but finding one with 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM with a similar 1GB graphics card UNDER $1100+ wasn't easy, especially since most of them were 15.6 inches or larger and I was looking for a smaller more portable laptop. I picked up this unit for about $930 (shipping included, no tax :-D) through Amazon's circuit city store. Lenovo is selling the same one through their website currently for $1070 (after discount) plus shipping and tax.      So, how about the performance? Simply amazing. I've been downloading Demo's of games left and right through Steam and can happily say this rig could handle most of anything I can throw at it, like Metro 2033 (High settings, 1366x768, with DX10), Home Front (same, on high, and full resolution), to name a few (I'll update the list in the coming future). I did try running Crysis (first copy) and met some slowing down (26-30 fps, all settings high, DX10) I blame the graphics engine on this case since other newer games seem to run just smoothly. Oh, as a side note the laptop stays surprisingly cool even while crunching heavy graphics, nice.     Windows experience index gave it a 5.8 rating overall with the hard drive being the lowest subscore (weakest link) but here's the breakdown:  Processor 7.8  Memory (RAM) 7.6  Graphics (for aero desktop performance) 6.7  Gaming Grahics 6.7  Primary Hard disk (Disk Data transfer rate) 5.8    Hardware, Fit and finsh? Here's where I think Lenovo saved a buck or two to keep cost down... or maximize profit. Whereas I though I was getting an awesome Hp Envy alternative is when I was kinda (not really) let down. The casing is for the most part is plastic, even the faux aluminum lid which is  a plastic black, with red metallic flakes, sheet etched with lateral lines to simulate brushed aluminum.  There's one exception; the base which I believe is matte black painted cast aluminum (CORRECTION: I confirmed it to be simply black plastic by removing the battery and discovered the injection mold lines...those cheap bastards!) . So it could said it's on the cheaper end, but because of this the overall the whole unit is surprisingly light and unexpectedly sturdy. Cost cutting FTW!    Now, the keyboard: while it may not be like them chiclet types found on them fancy apple products or other fine hardware it is comfortable to type on. Its not without shortcomings though; There is a slightly perceivable amount of flex on the whole board when pressed down firmly, again cost savings may be the culprit. Furthermore the layout, although great for typing, isn't very gamer friendly, but it is 14\\\\\" laptop afterall. I just wish they would've swapped the \\\\\"Fn\\\\\" key with the \\\\\"Ctrl\\\\\" like other conventional layouts. I'm considering a separate keyboard for gaming because of this.     So OK that nice, but how's the Sound? Impressive, them little JBL's can reproduce a good tune loudly, but sans the bass tones. They're an improvement over them standard laptop speaker anyways and good for conference calls and general movie watching. The web cam included is HD but otherwise like any other I've seen, so meh. The DVD drive included sadly is NOT BluRay, but hey what do you expect for this price range. The screen: It's sharp at 1366x768 speckles (like that word huh? I think it sounds cool) of resolution with a fairly good horizontal viewing angle, there's some washing of colors in the vertical plane when repositioning.    So, thats all I have say so far. Like I mentioned earlier I may update the games list at a later date. Ultimately even with the shortcomings I've very happy with this little laptop and recommend it.

The difference in quality comparing to the motherboard sound card is so very noticeable, sound is pure and crisp with headphones or speakers, really a pleasure for me to listen, especially classical orchestral music with this setup (I am a classical musician myself).    It is true what other reviewers say about this not being a true Xfi since the processing for effects occurs in software not on the chip. The sound quality or Sound to Noise ratio was the thing that mattered to me the most and this card has 108db of S/N ratio, more than some other X-fi models and for the price range the best in the sound to noise category, maybe not true \\\\\"audiophile level\\\\\" but those cards cost more than twice as much as this one.    The X-fi crystalizer audio effect is great for listening to internet radio such as free version of pandora or other stations which use lower bitrate streams, it really livens up the sound though I dont use it for high quality recordings.    So if you are not a gamer and just want good quality music listening then its a great solution, I am very pleased. Of course having speakers that match the quality is a must and I am happy to report I find the AV 30's to be exceptional for listening to classical, jazz, and most other styles...    I installed the card with the latest downloadable driver from the creative support website (not the included disc)and had no problems in windows 7...    Just be sure to uninstall any previous creative software or sound drivers before you install this one to be on the safe side!    Enjoy!",

I also use it for my Parallels data file which frees up a huge amount of space on my hard drive.<br /><br />It comes formatted ExFat which works fine but does not get backed up by Time Machine. So I eventually formatted it to the Mac format after which Time Machine adds it to the backup (unless specifically excluded).<br /><br />At the time I bought this there wasn't a model that was made to fit flush on the new Mac Retina 15, there is one now so I will be replacing this with the Transcend http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K73NWK0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",

            "input": "Caveats about non-standard usage: I run Linux on this thing, mainly Ubuntu.  I use the discrete Nvidia graphics card exclusively for machine-learning and artificial intelligence applications, and I run display and graphics exclusively on the integrated Intel graphics card.  I don't use this laptop for games.<br /><br />The good:<br />- The CPUs are really fast.  Jobs routinely run 10x as fast as on my AMD Phenom II desktop.<br />- The keyboard is surprisingly good.  I'm not usually a fan of chiclet keyboards, but the keys on this are deep and responsive.  It's still not as good as a regular keyboard (non-chiclet desktop-type).<br />- Build quality seems very good overall, but see the note below about the missing screw.<br />- Mostly well-supported by recent Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch).<br /><br />The medium:<br />- Looks: pretty good, not garish like many gaming laptops.  I love the matte finish, but it's a terrible fingerprint-magnet [edit: somehow gets better over time!].  Also, I was worried that the print on the keys would be hard to see, but it's fine.  The slightly-protruding lower-right lip is a bit weird but one almost never notices it.<br />- Trackpad: Gaming laptops for some reason like to put the trackpads a bit towards the right, which makes accidental clicks more frequent while typing.  On Linux this is quite easy to fix: man synclient and look for AreaRightEdge.<br />- Keys: As a techie I wish the Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys were better placed, but I realize I'm in a minority on this.<br />- Heat: it can handle CPU loads very well (all 4 CPUs (8 threads) running hard and it didn't even need the fan on!) but with any GPU-intensive load it starts throttling.  The laptop body doesn't get too hot, though.<br />- Battery life: I get 4-5 hours with all power-saving features turned on (no wifi, 30% brightness, switch off Nvidia GPU), 2.5 hours with a medium load, and 1 hour with an extreme load using the Nvidia GPU.  I think these numbers are about average for a gaming laptop.<br />- Webcam: mostly works okay with Linux but occasionally flakes out after resuming from suspend.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Laptop-makers are increasingly trying to make the edges of laptops thinner.  Presumably they hope this will make the laptop *look* thinner overall even if it isn't.  Apart from being deceptive, this leaves insufficient room for ethernet plugs, so they have to spring-load the ethernet port so that the bottom moves down to accommodate the plug.  This is not just a nuisance but adds an unnecessary point of failure.<br />- When I opened the laptop to replace the hard disk with an SSD, I noticed that the disk bed has 4 screw holes but only 3 screws: one is missing.  This is the second Asus laptop (out of two) in one month on which I've noticed this problem.  It makes me a little nervous about the build quality (which otherwise seems very good, but I'm no hardware expert).<br />- The wifi card is not very good.  Connection strength drops quite rapidly.<br /><br />The really bad:<br />- Nvidia's proprietary Linux driver is terrible.  The driver causes system hangs at least once a week.<br /><br />Other points:<br />- I immediately replaced the hard disk with a Crucial MX100 SSD, so I can't comment on the disk speed.  Booting Ubuntu from the SSD takes about 2 seconds :-).<br />- This has a TN panel.  I keep hearing that TN panels are terrible, supposedly because of poor viewing angles.  This one works perfectly well for me, and the viewing angle seems fine too.  On the other hand, I'm usually right in front of it so viewing angle isn't really an issue for me anyway.  I'm not an expert on this but I believe TN panels have faster response times and use less power than IPS panels.",

As background, I have an iPad which I love but find a bit on the heavy side and have been intrigued by the 7in form factor, and Android in general. I pre-ordered the Kindle fire, but when I saw this tablet I decided to give it a try while waiting.  I use Linux for work and I know the user interface is still ages behind Windows and Apple, and graphically remains shaky even to this day, but I wasn't prepared for how terrible Android is (it is 2.3 and maybe ICS is better but I doubt it will address the core issues which are cultural).  There are many reviews already, with a majority giving good ratings but after spending a lot of time with this tablet I am at a loss to explain how folks can recommend this thing. Is it the price? I dont even think the 300$ difference with the base iPad is meaningful because it is like comparing a broken bike to a Rolls Royce.  Yes, there may be Android tablets out there with faster processors and better hardware but that is not the problem here, it is a course project like software that is unfinished, unpolished, shaky, and developped by Google, a company with no regards to esthetics and user experience. I won't list here all the too many problems I had with it, but in conclusion, this is going back and I am now worried about the Kindle.  Appendix [Added in response to comment]  Here is a sample of what is wrong with Android and this tablet:  1) Functionality  ----------------  Browser fails to display many websites correctly. Had to download Opera to get something usable.  Email stuck in endless \\\\\"Downlading Messages\\\\\" loop, I have to press on the menu button and race to click on Accounts to access the INBOX folder directly to see any emails  Gmail app is terrible, I can post a snapshot of the UI if anyone cares  Camera app is unusable and ugliness personified (and the quality is horriblebut that's expected in a cheap tablet)  Youtube videos and videos in general (HBO Go) look pixelated  Remote app is interesting but for my Denon the Power button doesn't work  I found that app quality for the same apps that exist on iOS (e.g. mobile mouse) is much worse on this tablet  Initially, I had set the language to French, then later on changed it to English but auto-correct insists on French and makes typing anywhere a chore  Video calling like everyone else says only works on an unknown app  Needless to say, flash video is no where near smooth and pleasant  Haven't been able to get GPS to work  Battery drains quickly even when not used, standby has been less than 24h for me  While they may be ok on a phone, the 3 keys at the bottom of the screen are bad UI on a tablet. You constantly have to move your fingers back and forth between the content and the bottom while using it.  2) Cosmetics  ------------  User interface is inconsistent across the various built-in apps and menus, only the Vizio specific ones look good  Zooming and scrolling is jerky, shaky and feels severely lacking  Typing on a button or link in an app sometimes selects multiple ones and zooms in with all selected - very unpleasant  Zoom in level when this happens seems to be random  Photo gallery app produces a terrible background based on one of your photos  ...etc...  This was really just a sample, I can easily list more issues if anyone is interested.  In conclusion, if you want to use this for Netflix or playing games but are willing to live with a mostly unpleasant experience outside of those for the price go for it. I however, find this product unacceptable, and it is my opinion that this disregard of user feel and esthetics is an approach that permeates all Google products, i.e. we're giving it away for free, so we will do what we want. Some are ok with that.  Finally, I personally find the negative reviews the most useful and interesting but I think there is a divide between the Android and Apple crowds which make any objective discussion impossible.",

The microphones use the USB bus.  They automatically find and use the Microsoft generic USB audio driver when the camera is plugged in.  Because this device is not of the type \\\\\"Microphone\\\\\" it does not show up in most programs that are looking for \\\\\"Microphones,\\\\\" including Live Meeting and Communicator.

Luckily I had the old hard drive with XP that I just reconnected.  XP before I upgraded was using the ATI 9250 card, and so now when I loaded it again it had to install the 9550 drivers.  Right after I did this, windows media player was just not able to play any video file without any choppiness.  I played around with some of the hardware acceleration settings, and was able to play wmv, and MPGs, but no matter what I did, AVI playback was horrendous.  So I had to take it out and go back to my old 9250 and everything was working fine.  I did try the latest drivers from ATI, but nothing helped.  This may be a problem related to my configuraton, but I just wanted to mention it.

Plugged everything in, and they both ran flawlessly.<br />I can't tell you just how nice it is to have these modestly sized speakers just FILLING the room with sound!!!!!!  I can crank these up to extreme levels and they don't break up or lose accuracy.  We are THRILLED with these.  If you can get some, I highly recommend these.<br /><br />Hi, I just ordered these speakers, and have always had good experience with Altec products.  I see a few reviews of people with \\\\\"hissing\\\\\" problems with these speakers.  With the powerful 200 Watt Amp these have, any system noise in your computer will be amplified and heard through the speakers, also.<br />This is not the speakers fault, it is just something that most likely can be corrected by going into your audio settings on your computer.<br />( I also notice no MAC people are complaining - MACS seem to have good native adjustment.  )<br />So here is some helpful info I copied from a techie website!!!  Just adjust your audio settings.  ( Click on the little \\\\\"speaker\\\\\" icon and open up all the choices,  MAKE SURE THE MICROPHONE SETTING IS OFF or Zero. )  That seems to cure most of the problems.<br />You may have to go to some other function to change things on your sound card--- read what is pasted below. I hope this helps!!!! try muting your line in and any else that is not in use in the sound options \u2028\u2028makes a big difference<br />d_kuhn  08-19-2008 at 02:52:18 PM<br />-<br /><br />+<br />Onboard audio is typically not high quality, it's possibly your problem, it's also possible you've got a component in your system that's injecting more noise than usual (maybe something that's close to failing... or that isn't intended for consumer use). I have Realtek onboard audio on my HTPC but I replaced it with an Audigy card a couple years back, using the optical output to my audio rack keeps everything digital in the PC where you're most likely to get noise.<br />Reply to d_kuhn<br />boofricketyhoo  04-29-2009 at 03:43:24 AM<br /><br />Same thing happened to me. Tried numerous things and was ready to pull my hair out. I finally found the problem. I went into Realtek HD audio manager and then to Device advanced settings. Click on \\\\\"Make front and rear panel output devices playback two different audio streams simultaneously\\\\\" and uncheck the \\\\\"Output mic in/line to front panel\\\\\" and \\\\\"Output mic in/line to rear panel\\\\\" and the hissing should stop . Worked for me. I don't know how the settings changed in the first place but I had the same problem you described. And when I did as stated the hissing stopped immediately.<br />Reply to boofricketyhoo<br />Anonymous  03-17-2010 at 11:23:04 AM<br /><br />I had to make an account just to thank you, I muted my rear mic input and it fixed the problem. Thanks so much.<br /><br />grafixmonkey  08-08-2010 at 04:22:29 AM<br /><br />You're probably hearing the EMI from your hard drive's read head moving around. Any sound board that does anything with analog is susceptible to interference like this. I get a lot of it from optical drives on systems with cheap sound hardware. \u2028\u2028Some components are more susceptible to interference than others. Anything that's an analog input will react more strongly to interference than anything that's an analog output. (i.e. Aux, Line, Mic inputs.) \u2028\u2028The most sensitive point of interference though, is the cheap onboard microphone booster that you have to turn on to get decent levels on your mic. The microphone signal is such tiny voltage, that baseline noise that Scotteq mentioned is much more significant in comparison. When the microphone booster amplifies that signal, the noise and the mic get amplified together, boosting the noise.<br /><br />I must have a different version of the Realtek HD Audio Manager, but got the same results by going into \\\\\"Device advanced settings\\\\\" and checking \\\\\"Separate all input jacks as independent input devices.\\\\\"\u2028\u2028Before that, I had hissing at anything over 20% volume. Now, none up to 100%.\u2028\u2028\u2028Before that, I had hissing at anything over 20% volume. Now, none up to 100%.\u2028",

Please read on and allow me to elaborate.<br /><br />When I purchased this cable, I was trying to find a cable that could be chained together at least three times to be used to extend a USB 2.0 device from my media closet to the center of my living room. I ready the description of this item and understood that it was an &#34;active&#34; USB extension cable, which means that it would contain a USB HUB chipset molded into the connector to allow the cable to be chained together.<br /><br />The description of this product lists the following: &#34;Supports up to 127 devices on a daisy-chain configuration. A tough, yet flexible PVC jacket and durable connector mold ensures secure fits and easy cable handling.&#34;<br /><br />Unfortunately, after plugging this in I discovered that it does not contain a USB HUB enabling it to support the claim that you can &#34;daisy-chain&#34; this cable. After connecting three cabled end to end, I found that the length was too long to support USB devices and I started to receive driver errors and failures when capturing from a webcam.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this cable if you are looking for an active USB extension that contains a USB hub to support daisy chaining to overcome the 5 meter limitation of USB 2.0.<br /><br />DO buy this cable if you are only going to use a single extension cable where the overall length of all cables does not exceed 5 meters (16' 5&#34;).",

It is extremely slow.  Hike the price up a few more dollars and include something that is worth it.  I make heavy use of the Kindle as I'm on the road more then not for work.  I usually end up having to run the device directly off the charger (and sometimes it still shuts down) due to the charger taking forever.  One thing other people can do to reduce drain on the battery and also limit the charger time is to shut down wifi when not in use and to lower the screen lighting.  I do it as often as I can, but don't always have the time.<br /><br />2)  This is my biggest pet peeve.  Going through the process of shutting an app or a program down only to find out when your battery is almost dead that the program is/has been still running in the background.<br /><br />3) This is my second pet peeve.  I may be listening to music, and the player shuts down into song 3.  Then later on, I put the player down thinking it will automatically shut off, and I go back to it and the device is dead because it kept playing well beyond that.  This happens with all 3 of the programs with me (video is the best as it only happened once.) where it seems the device will decide when to place the device on standby based on what it wants to do and not to the programming.<br /><br />4)This isn't as bad as it sounds like.  It's just that many apps I've tried in the Amazon store say they are kindle tested and modified, but are still just android generics.  Be careful of what you put on your device as I downloaded another music player to try it out, and ended up having to return the device to factory specs as the app allowed buttons to be placed on the standby screen and it conflicted with the Amazon preset standby therefore freezing the device.  So look to make sure what the app affects.<br /><br />5)  I use the device when grabbing my laptop is inconvenient such as standing in line, taking the taxi to the hotel or meeting site, etc....  So I end up using some programs more regularly then others.  I change things around to reflect what I do with it, and it randomly decides when to change it.  My reorganizations may last a couple days, or a few minutes; but I end up having to go back and redo things again.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great device, and far improved over the other 3 tablets I've used over the last few years.  Personally, I have only a few nitpicks with it, but others (depending on how they will use it) will have no problem at all.",

Perhaps it is only because it is new, but they are stiff, and hard to slip the cover under.<br /><br />It works just fine in two positions (vertical, and horizontal angled) when the cover is used with the clips in the back.<br /><br />All iPad buttons are accessible, and again ...there is NO slipping.  I have even shaken the iPad in the case and it is held solid.  I'd also say that if the iPad were dropped in this case from a height of 4 feet, you'd scratch the case, but the iPad would be just fine probably 90% of the time.<br /><br />This is definitely a Griffin case, and not a counterfeit.  I wonder if the other reviewers did get a counterfeit as I cannot imagine they would complain about this case.  I would guess this authentic Griffin case was around $40 to $50 a few years ago when the iPad 1 was new.

It was decent, for what it's worth, as it had HDMI<br /><br />It doesn't even come close to comparing to the Elgato Game Capture HD.<br /><br />Historically, HDMI has never been kind to capture devices. Your best option was always an internal card (which from my experience is okay, but you'll eventually run into problems with device recognition and the like), and the very few external devices that actually provided HDMI capabilities kinda stunk (BlackMagic, for example).<br /><br />The Elgato Game Capture HD, however, rises above all those and is probably the best capture device on the market now. If you're looking for the simplest, most efficient way to capture footage from your PS3 or Xbox 360, this is it. No question.<br /><br />The device itself couldn't be easier to set up. HDMI in. HDMI out. USB out. That's all. And looking at the device itself, you'll notice one BIG difference between it and other external capture devices: No external power supply is needed! This makes it possible for you to take it with you, hook it up to a laptop, and literally record anywhere you want!<br /><br />Speaking of which, the device is pretty small, almost enough to fit in your pocket, and looks pleasant enough to display on your desk. I think aesthetics can be a problem with capture devices, since who is going to show off their little box that records them playing video games? But it's pretty sleek looking, all black and shiny, so go ahead. Show it off!<br /><br />It helps that the software is excellent as well. Elgato really seemed to have gamers in mind when designing the program, as it is outfitted with what they call Flashback Recording. Basically, it allows you to play your game and not have to worry about hitting record every time you want to capture specific footage. It automatically starts recording temporary footage when you open the program, and onceyou get the footage you need, you can choose exactly what to save. This is a huuuuuge thing for me, since I record fighting game footage, and it gets annoying have to stop my recording every so often when I have trouble landing combos. It honestly makes the recording session all the more relaxing knowing that I don't have to worry about missing anything.<br /><br />If there's one thing about the device I'd caution, it would be that you can only capture at 60 FPS with 720p, not 1080p. No word yet from Elgato if the plan to change anything about that, as it could just be a hardware limitation, 720p is not slouch, but it's something to consider if you're looking for the absolute highest quality in your footage.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the Elgato Game Capture HD is a true sight to behold. Simple, sleek, FUNCTIONAL, and with awesome software to boot. It's everything I've ever wanted in a capture device (MAYBE minus composite video recording. My SNES will remain uncaptured for now...) all rolled up into a tiny little black box. It seems unfathomable that it could work as well as it does, but, well... it does! Sure the price is a little on the high end for capture devices, but it provides so much value in its ease of use and stability that it's definitely worth the cost of admission.",

I was looking to go for a little bit bigger sound but needed the height of the speakers to be about the same as the z 313.  these speakers fit nicely on the bottom shelf of my TV stand. They are rated at 30 watts RMS.  18 watts in the subwoofer, and six watts in each satellite.  They do have quite a bit more powerful sound than the z313. I like the fact that the volume control is located on one of the satellite speakers. It feels as if there are less wires to get in the way. I also really like the fact that the subwoofer has its own volume control. It is located on the back of the subwoofer, which is a little bit of an inconvenient place, but at least it has the option to control it. The satellite speakers are taller than the ones in the Z 313 speakers. They also have tweeters on the back so it projects sound behind the speakers as well.  These speakers also have inputs that can be easily connected to other devices, such as a television.  I really enjoy the extra speakers, expecially at the price I got them for! I think its is a nice upgrade from the Z 313.  I added photos of the product that I purchased. The shelves on the stand are 9.25 inches in height. There is a little room to spare.

I erased the corrupted software (but did not reformat the drive) and the drive has been working fine since then. I sometimes run my laptop very hot which also causes this drive to get very hot and I initially thought this was part of the problem but I've run it just as hot since getting the drive to work so I'm guessing a software problem is the culprit.

I haven't built a serious computer in a long time, so I had to reacquaint myself with some industry standards.  That being said, the manual got the job done, but it sure could use a little love regarding the size of text and pictures.  I recommend going to the ASUS website and downloading the latest manual.  The installation wasn't painless, but that is mostly not ASUS's fault.  I took my time and planned everything out.  Heck, I'm still planning on improvements and the system is fully functional.  Please note that the 4-pin (PWM) CPU_FAN connector MUST BE USED.  I purchased the Corsair H100 Water Cooler for my i7 2600K and the installation went fine.  However, the H100 has a 3-pin connector so I couldn't use the 4-pin connector.  In fact, all of the fans in my chassis are 3-pin.  On initial bootup, the BIOS refuses to start because it cannot detect a CPU fan - pretty slick.  I was slicker and connected my now defunct stock CPU cooler to the CPU_FAN connector.  I have ordered a 4-pin fan to replace a chassis fan to remedy this problem.  My initial memory purchase was from Crucial using their web-based memory tool.  ASUS really needs to update what memory works with their motherboards.  After spending an hour with an ASUS technical rep., I had to order the Corsair Vengence memory and return the memory from Crucial.  This motherboard is very sensitive about memory.  However, the Corsair memory worked perfectly.  The manual should be a little more helpful regarding hard disk drives.  I installed Windows 7 just fine on my 120 GB SSD, but I couldn't find the 1TB HDD once the OS was loaded.  Again, not really ASUS's fault as this is a Windows issue.  However, it wouldn't hurt to mention this (and how to correct).  To recap, everything works great on this motherboard and when properly designed the temperatures are amazing (23C on the CPU, 25C on the motherboard at 4.3 GHz).  I would love to add the optional 50mm motherbaord fan, but I can't seem to find any description in the manual.  Again, ASUS needs to add a little more attention to detail regarding the manual.  I highly recommend this motherboard.

As must of you know, products from Apple come at a premium and I wanted something to protect the top portion of my laptop as I worked. I previously purchased a clear keyboard cover by Moshi and was rather impressed by their products. I spotted this clear palmguard and thought I would give it a chance<br /><br />PACKAGE AND APPLICATION<br />The Palmguard arrives adhered to a piece of thick cardboard. The instructions on how to apply to the MacBook Pro are printed on the backside along with tabs to help aid in separation of Palmguard from the cardboard. Yes, for those wondering, the Palmguard stays in place due to an adhesive. The great thing, though, is the adhesive does not leave a residue on the notebook once removed.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br />The Palmguard is clear in appearance and blends in naturally on your notebook. The Palmguard is not very thick and so it rests relatively flush with the rest of the notebook.<br /><br />USEAGE<br />The Palmgard is comfortable during use. It is not raised on the notebook and is flat therefore I can rest my wrists on it perfectly while typing. Unfortunately, I did notice a big problem. There are several multi finger swipe commands that start off to the side of the trackpad with movement onto the trackpad. With the Palmguard in place, these finger-swipes will not register and so these movements will not work.<br /><br />The trackpad portion of the Palmguard I attached for a day but removed. Why? The palm guard for the trackpad was very smooth to touch. It took some getting us to but I realized I enjoyed the slightly textured feel of the trackpad bare.<br /><br />Also, since the Palmguard is clear, after several days of usage, I have noticed bubbles forming under the guard. I have done my best to go back and smooth out the guard but some of the bubbles are present which gives my notebook, now, a tacky appearance.<br /><br />PROS:<br />++ Perfect fit for the Macbook Pro 15<br />++ Blends in aesthetically with the rest of the MacBook Pro due to clear nature<br />++ Protects the aluminum casing from scratches & dirt from extensive use<br /><br />CONS:<br />++ Many of Apples new finger swipe motions require you to use the side of your laptop surrounding the trackpad. This cover prevents those finger swipe motions from being preformed<br />++ The clear nature of the PalmGuard makes air bubbles very noticeable<br />++ After much use, the clear becomes discolored. Right now it is becoming a white milky color. It is not dirt. Usage is just changing color.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />This item does have a premium over similar products. It protects your laptop, aesthetically is pleasing, and is comfortable in use. I recommend it if you want a clear coating to your laptop but, personally, I went with a black leather cover from [[ASIN:B0032Z8IIQ Twelve South]] as it fixes many of the defects I feel this Palguard suffers from.ok Pro 15<br />++ Blends in aesthetically with the rest of the MacBook Pro due to clear nature<br />++ Protects the aluminum casing from scratches & dirt from extensive use<br /><br />CONS:<br />++ Many of Apples new finger swipe motions require you to use the side of your laptop surrounding the trackpad.

From the perforated look rubberized area where your thumb rests to the brushed metal strips which arcs gracefully around the side of the mouse, to the low gloss plastic finish and the metal scroller wheel with rubber insert, it's a beautiful mouse, high quality mouse.    It's extremely comfortable as well. Perhaps not quite as much as my old MX Revolution, but very close.    Darkfield is extremely precise and works on every surface I've tried, from my shirt to my glass desk.    This is the Cadillac CTS-V of mice.    Battery is a removable and replaceable AA unit, a nice feature since internal battery failure caused the death of my MX Revolution.    Charging is done via USB cable, so no down time.    Battery life on its first full day of use is excellent, still 3 bars after hours of use.    Have a middle mouse button again! Now shifting between the wheel modes is done via dedicated button.    Nifty little travel case    Plenty of programmablity.      Cons: Cons are only a few.    Forward/back/zoom buttons don't quite fall into reach as naturally as they did on the MX Revolution.    Loss of shift-to-click. I'll miss this feature. Loved how the MX Revolution could be programed to switch from geared to free spin depending on how fast the wheel spun, then would switch back.      Other Thoughts: My dear MX Revolution bit the dust on me a few weeks ago, due to internal battery failure, yet despite buying the original four years ago, Logitech replaced it with the new model.    It's really worth saying that their customer support is superb, friendly, and helpful. They also send you return shipping labels now so you don't have to pay for shipping. Now that's progress. Turnaround was about 2 weeks total. I will continue to buy products from Logitech, they stand behind them.    My only other minor complaint is the Application Switcher. I don't care for it...distorts the windows and when many are up it looks cluttered. But that's just a keystroke assignment away to set it back to Document Flip, so it's not an issue.    Overall I love this mouse so far, and while I do miss my MX Revolution, this is a worthy successor. It's even better looking and very nearly as comfortable, very precise and works on surfaces the old mouse never could.    Hopefully it will last!",

This was a much cheaper solution to buying a TV.  Graphic quality is great when the display size is kept small but is even acceptable  at full screen.  My daughter even watches cartoons on her PC now.  When I asked her why she didn't go upstairs and watch it on TV she said this is cooler!  It even came with a remote that works with no problems.  Overall I'm very happy with it.  I even used it to tape one of my favorite bands playing on the Late Late show and it worked great.  For what it costs you can't go wrong!

The Toshiba media center might have a burner on it but I gave up in disgust after flipping through options.<br /><br />That flipping is due to the gesture touchpad. A wrong move flips to another screen. With the default settings reading a webpage is a pain. Turning the gesture touchpad feature off helped some but its still a pain.<br /><br />Toshiba fills this machine with enough bloatware.<br /><br />Windows ATE . . . not since Windows 3.1 has Microsoft released an operating system more poorly designed.

Most people shopping for Wacom tablets probably have owned similar products in the past. This product is more affordable than the higher end Intuos3 models, yet powerful enough for many pros. While I have struggled with rating this product a 3 or 4, it is definitely a good product.<br /><br />First of all, the \\\\\"medium\\\\\" sized tablet will look large to most people. This size is perfect for hard core graphics people who need to work at the pixel level for large images. However, most users will find the small size probably fits the needs of occasional graphics use. Those using this for the mouse and function keys may prefer this size. Either way, the pen function will map to your screen size for any of the Wacom models.<br /><br />This unit comes in a variety of colors and configurations. The mouse is nice because it allows you to free up a USB port if you're using a USB mouse. Power users will need more from a mouse though. If you're anything like me, you prefer a mouse with many more options than this one provides.<br /><br />The Bamboo software also allows you to customize the buttons. Left-handers will greatly appreciate this!<br /><br />Upon plugging in the device, the mouse worked immediately! The pen also works as a mouse or as a pen/brush for drawing applications. Be prepared to spend some time tweaking this unit to your likes though. Installing the drivers and software allows you to access the settings and tools that make this device versatile and customizable.<br /><br />The software included with this device is a nice to have. Many people who buy this will already have or need full blown Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Elements gives you everything casual users need. The Corel application is nice to play with. But other than a few \\\\\"macro\\\\\" type functions I have yet to find anything I can't already do with Adobe.

As configured the ThinkPad booted very quickly to the Windows Log in screen in approximately 25 seconds, I was able to use Windows in about 35-40 seconds.<br /><br />I just installed the Corsair Vengeance kit in the E420 and it recognizes all 16 GB of the RAM and it is booting up in similar times.  What I do notice is that when multiple programs are running it is much snappier!  The machine opens new windows instantaneously, even while performing multiple tasks!  I have also ordered a Crucial mSATA3 M4 256 GB SSD which should arrive on Monday.  The bonus is that my 500 GB HDD will stay in place as a mass storage device while I gain the SSD advantage of tremendous speed!  I am actually going to clone the new SSD from the HDD so that I have the option of two boot drives.  If a catastrophic failure ever occurs I will be covered.<br /><br />The Corsair RAM Kit came as promised and took me less than 5 minutes to install and it improved my Windows Experience score:<br /><br />Processor: 7.5<br />RAM: 7.5 (was 7.1)<br />Windows Aero: 6.3 (was 5.7)<br />3-D Graphics: 6.3<br />HDD: 5.9 (the bottleneck)<br /><br />I will amend this review as soon as the new mSATA drive is installed and I have time to give it a thorough testing.<br /><br />It feels that I have desktop computer speeds in a portable 14\\\\\" laptop computer, this is amazing!!!",

Otherwise, it's a nice, sturdy case. If there's one problem, it's that to accommodate the (low-profile, even!) SAS board I decided to use, I had to lose one of the drive bays - I thought it would only be necessary with a full height card, but no.    Also, the fans are reasonably quiet, but they're only 3-pin fans - so no PWM speed control, just tach feedback. I may end up replacing them with fans that can be controlled. Also, it'd be nice if they included a USB 3.0 to 2.0 header adapter; I had one laying around from my workstation build (Corsair included one with the case I used for it), so I was able to swipe that for this, but it's like, a $2 part. A lot of boards you'd want to use for a NAS application still don't have USB 3.0 onboard, so it'd be helpful to have. (Also also, do you really have to glue the HD Audio cable onto the board in the front of the machine?)    Otherwise, this will be a nice FreeNAS box, once I receive the replacement backplane board from SilverStone...    Edit: A hacksaw and a half-hour allowed me to rescue the lost drive bay.

            "input": "I just got this router set up yesterday and so far it's working. So I'll post what I find here and will just get to it as I test this router. As an techie guy I really needed more from a router and this one had what I needed. I have never used any of the asus routers, but I have used their motherboards and stopped using them since they would normally die after a few years as if they had programed them to do so. This was when they first came into the market though. I knew they made good stuff, so I thought I give them a try again after all this time. I have also changed routers so much that now I just wanted something more affordable and with the features that I needed. I spend so much on other routers and was just let down so I didn't want to spend too much on one this time around.    This one didn't prompt about the new firmware like the AC52-U did, but since I had set that one up the day before, I did it manually and found it and updated the router. I have done that many times before too so it wasn't a hard thing to do. This router makes is a piece of cake anyway. Configuring will take longer since there are many other features that need to be checked, but it all works just fine.    I wanted to add a picture but I can't never seem to be able to find that option on here.    Pros:  - Has support for more dynamic addresses which I needed in order to get to my network. Asus also has their own ddns which is really nice and doesn't expire like many others have and still do. Netegear only has one, dyndns which is no longer free.  - I like the GUI they use, it's nice and also has a lot more choices in features compared to many other routers out there. This software is similar to ddwrt in terms of features plus the cloud/streaming apps. Most people won't use them, but if you're in IT, you do use these and they make your life much easier when it comes to these things.  - I really like how they have also implemented a way for you to access your own network with these routers. Do read the security problems they had in the past though.  - The android apps are nice. So far they are not perfect since one of them tends to crash every now and then. Either way that's more than you get with other routers and you can use the apps to get to your network as well. I still have to go out and test that and the security of the apps themselves because I don't want someone using my phone to access my network. So I'll be checking this a bit more later.  - This one weights a bit more than the AC52-U which was just too light and the stand very weird and flimsy. Although still has the good software this has.  - Built-in vpn sever, how cool is that.  -I haven't experienced anything weird with the wireless yet on the laptop or phone so we'll see how that goes. It's only been a day.    Cons:  For whatever reason when you go to their site for help or knowledge search, all the icons don't work. Not really bad but I guess someone forgot to fix the site as well. It's nice that you can go directly to what you need help on from the router itself. Not to mention actual description of things you may want to know about in the setting pages themselves. That's very helpful. I sure hope they keep improving that and their support, that will make a huge difference. When you used these things often, it's nice to be able to reach someone if you have any questions or need help with something.  -After setting up the AC52-U model before this one, I noticed that it had a way for me to change the name of the network components in the network map so it would be easier to identify them. This one, for whatever reason doesn't allow me to do that. Both routers are very similar in terms of software which is nice, but I missed that on this one which I really liked. I do hope they will implement that on this router as well. The only reason I didn't keep the AC52-U model was because it's only a 10/100 router and no usb 3 port. Every other feature is there though.  -The AC52-U was manufactured in 2014, this RT-AC56U was manufactured in 2013, so I couldn't figure out why that was. I figured what the heck, I'll give it a go even after reading all the bad things since many of the reviews where a bit older.  - One thing I don't care much about is how the ASUS router cases are designed. The way this model is, you can only set it on the desk or shelf the way you see it on the pictures. It has a sort of permanent aluminum foot. I won't call it a stand as it's just something that looks like it's holding it from the front and the back. Well that metal square you see on the picture is what I'm referring to. If it was a perfect rectangle then it would be fine, but these are angled which take more room and you can't really place other thing nearby. For example I like how the netgear routers stand upright or can be placed flat. If they can make a stand that can be placed upright on either side so that you can use it for whichever side the wires stick out, then that would be much better because you won't be limited to only one side and other things can also fit in the front and back without any problem. Since the wires stick straight out on this one, it's sort of at an angle on my shelf, so placement can be a bit tough in limited spaces. Having the wires coming out of one side would be much better so this can allow it to face either way in an upright position, or even flat on a surface. Forget about wall mounting this one too. These are things that really need to be addressed with the design on these Asus routers, but this is just my observation. Also that diamond cut on the AC-52-U actually made me kind of dizzy so I don't care for that. Weird but true. With that said, that's minor compared to the features, that's what I really needed and this router has it, so I'm very happy with this part of it. They have put a lot of thought behind that so it's very refreshing to see this from a router that anyone can purchase.    Update:  -I just decided to set up an asus DDNS and it doesn't work. I also set up an ftp to test with i but can't get to anything. My no-ip address is working though.  -I found out that the Aiplayer will not control my nas. I just read that was something that would be added but the player was able to see the files when I had the dvd player on the tv. These have been out for some time though. Once I turned that dvd off, I can't see that anymore. I was basically trying to stream music from a nas. Although most of the app access is for what is plugged into the usb ports, I was able to see my nas and other internal computers from the Aicloud app. Yes, these are two different apps, but I'm testing both at the moment. My nas may be a bit old and slower than new ones so your mileage may vary. Once I connect through the Aicloud app, the nas shows up in the Aiplayer but it's just loading, loading and loading in that app. I am able to get to the files with the Aicloud app and stream from there if it doesn't crash like it just did. Streaming works but it's not as nice as the AiPlayer.  I'm doing this from an android phone to also test out the wireless connection. I keep noticing the wan ip being offline, I even saw this for my no-ip address. It's midnight so that may also have something to do with the isp, I'll change back to no-ip for now and test the asus ddns tomorrow. For some reason it looks like I have to keep hitting reapply to connect in the router settings. Okay, the app has stopped again when I tried closing it so it may just be an app problem since I know my no-ip address works and so does my nas.  -While changing back to the no-ip ddns I noticed that the hostname didn't change, so watch this as your ddns will still not work until you manually change that back again.  -In short, use the Aicloud for everything and the AiPlayer only if you have music/videos on the usb connected device that you want to stream as I'm having problems with just the AiCloud stopping but at least it works even with the lag while I'm still in my own network. The ready nas does show up in my AiPlayer but just keeps on loading. I should mention that the AiCloud on the browser does work well so you can still access your network this way without any problem. I'm not sure why it's not working as well on the android Jelly Bean. My phone has an Arm Quadcore Cortex-A7 processor so it's no slouch either. So yes, this seems to be the app and not the router which is a good thing so far because I just need access to my network for now, and as long as that works I'm okay.    Update November, 22, 2014  -Today I found out I locked myself out of the router. I enabled HTTPS only just to secure it a bit more but now I get a message about an ip address. Needless to say I can't get back into the router even using the https address. So don't set that up on this router. I have the latest firmware 3.0.0.4.374_5656 on it and it looks like it's not working.  -I found out that they have had a security problem as many linux problems, but this one has apparently been a problem as well and it's still not fixed, well I think they had an update now. After trying all the different options I could, I had to resort to the last choice which was to reset the router...the good thing is that this did work. Unfortunately it was the only thing that worked. The good thing is that I had created a backup of my setting so I got that restored, but had the https setup and got the ip message again. Since I was already logged in I was able to change that to http and restart and create a new backup. If you don't have a backup of your settings you just need to make all the changes again manually. It's working again so that's a good thing.  -I'm now testing the usb printer through the router and although it shows up, I still can't print. Windows won't find the network printer. Okay after messing around for two hours with this. I have managed to get a printed test page. Just use the utility found under USB/network printer called Asus EZ-Printer setting. It looks like you have to use this every time which sucks. Now I have to go install it on the other computers so this is why it sucks, I couldn't detect the printer automatically. I also tried adding a local printer manually and had no luck.  -Having all these problems I thought I test out the AiPlayer again...what do you know, I can now access my nas music from it...so it looks like if you set the https on the router, it just won't work. There is a small wait, but I think that is due to my older nas and how many folders it has. So it looks like I figured this problem out too. Cool.  -I just found another problem if you use the usb on this router. You won't be able to print from an android device. The Hammermill printing app can't find it. It sees the router, but doesn't see the printer. So if you need or want to print from an androd device, keep the printer connected to a network port instead of using the usb. I think that is the best choice at the moment since I had no problems installing and printing from anything on the network, at least until this gets fixed. I just noticed there's no way to disable the printer so I can unplug it from the router either...so I unplugged the usb, put the printer back on the cat6 cable and was back up in as long as it took the computer to put the printer back on. Okay I'm done testing for today.    Update December 16, 2014  I want to make this update before I forget things I have done lately. I was out of town in another state on the opposite side of the country and got the retail version of this router for a family member. They are exactly the same thing other than the letter on the box. This one is a U and the retail version is an R. The setup after the firmware update was still the same which was nice. Once I got it all setup, I wanted to get the ddns working on it, but they had a very old U-verse modem which also had to be updated. Once that was done I ended up having the same problem with the so called new modem/routerthat they gave us. There is no bridging option that I could find and tweaking the modem any way I could just didn't let me get that set up correctly so I could have them connect back into their own network. In short, At&T U-verse was a real pain to work with as they also wanted to charge me to get that set up for whatever reason. The old modem didn't even have wireless N and, but the new one did even though I didn't use that modem for anything else other than the connection itself and the modem also had gigabit ports but you have to log into the darn thing to find all this out as they don't even label any of the other ports. In short, the router was double NATted even with all the passthrough and firewall turned off and it will tell you that ddns won't work this way anyway. I got it to be connected, but it still didn't work. Unfortunately I was also limited on time so I couldn't wait to do much more testing, but I left it all set up as much as it would allow me. Towards the end I did have some trouble with the wireless for some reason, I just lost all wireless connection and I barely got that working back again before I left. I thought there was some interference since it had been working so I tried to change some of the settings which I can't remember now, but I got that back which was a good thing as it would be harder to trouble shoot it from across the country since I am not able to connect directly with it unfortunately. I can do it another way, but still, that modem setup just makes it hell to work with. The U-verse speed was nice, but the modem headache not so much since it's one of those things, so close, yet so far. I got the router to make my life easier, but if the modem doesn't let you through, your back to square one. Well at least I know the router seems to be okay. Everything else I wrote for my version still applies to the retail version. Both are running the same firmware. On the other hand I was able to log into mine just fine so I got a chance totest that, unfortunately my dsl line was so darn slow that the vpn was a slug but worked without a hitch. I'm sure that my old stuff also had much to do with that, but still, the router didn't skip a beat and that's what matters to me. I need stuff to just work.    Update January 24, 2015  There is was a new firmware update. They added the ability to change the client names which I really liked. Some clients have a bunch of numbers and giving these a name makes them easier to know what you're looking at. It's not critical, but it's a nice touch. So far the router is still working fine. I have also been using one usb drive in through the USB 3 port and I like that the drive is not always on. It sort of stays on a sleep mode until you need it which is really nice. So it's always there but won't actually turn on until you connect to it.  The only thing this router needs is its own anti virus to protect the network on top of what it already does. Now this would be a nice addition because then I would really not have to worry about each component connected to the network. Just in case I miss something of course.",

The four straps at the four corners hold the device in place and the case does not get in the way of the standard Amazon USB cable. The case looks good but it's not cutting edge style and design. There are no pockets for a stylus or business cards or anything else. On the outside there is a strap that can hold the case closed, which is a plus if you are putting the device in a bag or backpack with other devices that may come into contact with the screen.<br /><br />When reading, with the cover folded under the device, the left side is slightly raised. This I find gives you a nice hold, with your thumb pressing against the hump. This may be even more useful with the basic Kindle since your thumb can be very close to the page turn buttons on the left side of the device.<br /><br />In addition to the Paperwhite, this Marblue case is also a good fit for the basic Kindle (the one without a touchscreen and without a keyboard). It doesn't get in the way of the charging cable either. However, for the basic Kindle, I find that the official Amazon case (product code B004SD1XB0) is a much more organic fit if you like a slim easy to handhold setup that makes the case disappear.<br /><br />The Marblue also fits the 6-inch Kobo Touch ereader, however, its power button is covered by the top right strap, so if you turn it on/off often, it may get irritating.<br /><br />The Marblue also just barely fits the 6-inch Nook Simple Touch. Its power button however is on the back of the device, so you probably have to remove it from the case if you want to use the power button.<br /><br />Since I was experimenting, I also tried the Marblue with the Kindle with Keyboard and the original Kindle Fire color screen tablet. They don't fit since both devices are bigger than the actual Marblue case.<br /><br />Unboxing: it comes in frustration free packaging and friends of the environment will be thrilled that it does not include a foam padding. As with most cases these days, there is an initial smell, so now I air them all out for 2-3 days whether they need it or not. This one needs it but the smell is not as bad as some other cases. By air it out, I mean, I leave it open near a door or window that gets airflow, but I don't do anything special to it.",

Compared to the refinement of other tablets that I own from Apple and Samsung, this just fell short for me.  The software felt snappy enough, but the limited app store left the tablet feeling incomplete. The high level of parental controls available just wasn't enough to overcome these shortcomings for me.<br /><br />If you have kids that have been exposed to iPads and Android tablets, this may feel like a step backwards for them.  The simplified interface would be perfect for a first time user, but more advanced users (like my 4 year old) might be disappointed.  Loading a book for the first time takes a little bit of time (30 secs to a minute), but opens quickly afterwards.  Pages seemed to turn easily with a tap at the edge of the page - unlike the experience some seem to be having with the 6&#34; version.<br /><br />The two year &#34;no questions&#34; warranty,one year of access to Amazon FreeTime Unlimited and free case was what put me over the edge to pre-order this tablet before hands-on reviews were available, but the shortcomings of the Fire HD 7 Kids Edition just aren't balanced out by these benefits.<br /><br />As much as I love Amazon for most things, this tablet is going back.

A common scenario is when I'm making a presentation from my laptop and for some reason I have to shift the position of the computer.  If I don't hold the connector in place while I do this, the force exerted by the HDMI cable will cause the connection to break.  This then causes the computer to think I have unplugged the display, which makes it revert to \\\\\"internal display only\\\\\" mode, which takes a few seconds.  Then I have to push the adapter back into place and wait until the computer figures out that I've plugged in an external display and adjust accordingly (which takes a few more seconds.)

Their old hard drive was a 250GB 7200 RPM WD Blue series drive which was over half empty. The older Dell Optiplex computer only has SATA II interfaces.<br /><br />The Optiplex uses caddies for the 3.5 inch drives. I got a [[ASIN:B00G56ZNZU SABRENT 3.5 to 2.5-Inch drive bay adapter]] which is supposed to work well with screwless caddies. The Optiplex caddy had to be modified to remove a piece of plastic to work with the adapter's centered placement of  the 2.5 inch drive. FYI.<br /><br />Except for the above, installation was effortless. Closing the existing hard drive to the SSD using an [[ASIN:B000QY9KIS Apricorn USB to IDE/PATA/SATA Drive Adapter]] was very easy. When we could boot the system we installed the Samsung utility and upgraded the firmware. Easy and no problems.<br /><br />The performance difference was stunning. The system booted in seconds and applications loaded almost as fast. The client was thrilled and felt it was like having a new computer at a fraction of the cost and hassle.<br /><br />I found the utility for the drive very useful as it could give an assessment of the drive life and helped with some performance tuning so we could get the most out of the drive. Nicely done giving the impression of a professional tool rather than an engineering afterthought.<br /><br />I'm giving the EVO 5 stars. It provides a great product in a great package with excellent supporting software. My only concern is one I have for all SSD drives and that is longevity.

I recommend 2.1 (with a subwoofer) for avid music listeners and movie watchers, but these sound remarkably good for the price.  The sound is crisp and clear.  My only gripe is the bass is a little overpowering with music listening (the back of each speaker has a whole, a sort of bass port).  Still the bass is much better than no bass at all.  For movie watching people will appreciate the rich sound.  Decent for mp3s, great for DVDs.  I use this as a secondary set of speakers.  I have a laptop and sometimes when I travel I don't want to listen to the built in 'tin can' sounding ones, that's when these come in handy.  I also use them with my portable mp3 cd player, so they are versatile.  Overall for what you pay, you're getting nice sounding speakers.  As I said I would like a bass or tremble adjustment knob (that would make these a 5 star item) and perhaps they could be a little sleeker in size.  They do not take up too   much desk space because their bottom width is small enough, but they are a bit too tall.  I can tolerate this though, because they are relatively stylish.  Fairly impressed.  Altec makes some really solid speakers and these are no acception (FYI: there is cloth covering over the front of the speakers).  They feel like they are built to last, and I believe they have a one year warranty. <br /> <br />A definite recommendation for a 2.0 speaker set <br />especially for: <br />watching dvds and listening to music on a laptop and for using with discmen/ mp3 players.",

The trackball isn't great, as other reviewers have mentioned but it works and it's convenient for basic tasks.  (A separate mouse is highly recommended for any serious work.)  There are two fundamental flaws with this product:    1) If you press either of the integrated mouse buttons, the cursor begins to move erratically around the screen.  This makes drag & drop and any mouse+button action impossible and horribly frustrating.    2) The media keys are not programmable.  It's great for Windows media center, but nothing else.

I was nervous that this was going to be a behemoth, it\u2019s really not.<br /><br />Anyhow, now that the size thing is out of the way, it\u2019s a nice, large rolling laptop/notebook case.  I was disappointed that it did not have a water bottle carrier \u2013 I thought I had read that it did \u2013 it does not.  The padding for the laptop area, I thought, was rather skimpy.  For those of you that are wondering if there is padding on the inside of the bag where the telescopic handle retracts to, no there is not \u2013 disappointed in this one too.<br /><br />I\u2019ve had Targus rolling bags in the past and chose to purchase another Targus bag from experience; however this one seems lacking in quality as compared to the other bags I\u2019ve owned.<br /><br />My primary reason for buying this bag was size.  Although I do not have a 17\u201d notebook, for reasons I won\u2019t bore you with, I do carry two 15.6\u201d notebooks/laptops with their power cords and accessories (one of which I have an extra battery for), 3 textbooks, a 9.5\u201d X 5.5\u201d notebook, a TI-XX (large) calculator, several cables, 2 bottles of 5-hour energy, a PCMCIA memory card, some feminine products (sorry to the male readers who get skeeved), several pens and pencils, and a handful of other small techie gadgets \u2013 I have all of these items packed in the bag right now.  While it\u2019s close to tight, all that stuff fits nonetheless!<br /><br />The zippers seem to be well made and the rest of the construction is that traditional duffel bag material.  The wheels are a lot better than the Samsonite bag I\u2019m coming from, which is actually the reason for my buying a new bag.  The wheels on my old bag lost their bearings and stopped rolling.  Interestingly, since I do carry two laptops, I cut out the padding from the old bag and put it in-between my two laptops in the new bag.  So that\u2019s yet another item in the bag!<br /><br />As I said, the wheels are well made \u2013 they\u2019re a bit larger, they sit in a little from the edge (which must help with the stability), and are very quiet.  I guess I shall see how it holds up.<br /><br />Would I buy this again? I think yes, but it\u2019s really too early to tell.  If you\u2019re buying on size alone, as I did, I\u2019d say yes.  I\u2019m just looking forward to not having to carry around 2 laptops :D<br /><br />Lastly, the star rating - I would have liked the option to go 1/2 stars so that I could have rated it at 3-1/2 stars, but could not.  The padding thing weighs heavily.  For consumers who are buying this bag, that have already purchased a 17&#34; laptop, they want to have it protected.",

Hopefully this may help you narrow down what it is exactly you are looking for in a wireless headset and determine which may be the best suited.<br /><br />Video Contents:<br /><br />Direct Comparative Look at the Similarities and Differences of the Able Planet True Fidelity Wireless Headphones and OAproda 2.4GHz Wireless Headset<br /><br />Additional Individual Consideration of the Able Planet True Fidelity Wireless Headphones Construction and Qualities<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />PC (and PS3) audio setup was super simple on my part - I plugged in the USB, my laptop did its immediate BLIP, and then I went into Control Panel > Sound and set the \\\\\"2.4GHz Wireless Headset\\\\\" as default. And done. The PS3 was pretty much the same thing. MIC on the other hand took a bit more tweaking on the PC (for the PS3, it was a simpler manner of just setting the MIC to the 3.5mm Input selection). MIC Quality is decent enough, but I would certainly \\\\\"upgrade\\\\\" the boom MIC with a nicer one, which is an advantage to the 3.5mm MIC plugins. Just go to your local Tech Store or even online, and you can find hundreds of cheap (and usually better) options. But the included one is, once again, decent enough. It is also a very flexible gooseneck style. Being AUX driven as opposed having an optical connection when considering consoles, some analog noise is to be expected, yet nothing that kills the performance both as Game Audio and Chat. Performed best, really, on my laptop once I finished tweaking the MIC settings.<br /><br />Audio is good. It has plenty of BEWM BEWM bass while remaining crystal clear in the mids and highs. Comfort is \\\\\"Okay\\\\\". The padding is on the thin and firm side, and the headphones did squeeze a little on my head (I wear glasses, so I notice such things quite quickly). Extra kudos for providing two mini USB to USB cords along with two AUX cords and so on. They are all of average quality, but having two mini USB cords does allow you to keep the receiver plugged in, not having to swap out it to the headset when you need to recharge it.<br /><br />Paring is immediate.

Between the two headsets I compare, I do prefer this OAproda, mainly due to its 2.4GHz clarity and preferred audio performance, being deeper, richer.<br /><br />Personally though, I think the comfort level, i.e. the padding, could be ratcheted up a notch and the included AUX cords a nicer quality (flat cable, gold plated) and the MIC, well, heh - it does work well enough, but it isn't all that special either.<br /><br />-- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.cords along with two AUX cords and so on.

What the iPearl mCover does do is add color and grippy texture to your kindle.      The mCover slid onto my Kindle very easily, about 30 seconds worth of easy.  Given the grippy nature of the silicone it won't slide off on it's own.  Once on the Kindle, the keys, ports and screen are left exposed except for the page turning buttons on both sides.  While the page turning buttons are covered, the mCover provides small marks (arrows) which I've found are just as easy or easier to use by touch than by sight.  The silicone does not hinder the use of these buttons at all.  Since the silicone adds a nice texture which can make te Kindle easier to hold on to, especially if hands are very dry.  Once you become accustomed to it you won't want to be without.    Now for the downside and the reason for deducting a star.  The colors, while bright when seen on Amazon and even while in the package, are somewhat translucent.  On a white Kindle they would remain vibrant and show their true color.  On a grey Kindle, the darkness of the grey comes through and what was a bright color in the packaging turned into a muted and dull color on the device.  Since the mCover is a skin I'm really disappointed that the color no longer popped when on my grey Kindle.      Something else you may want to note is that the silicone picks up everything, dust, dirt, pet hair, etc. It's easy enough to brush off and the skin is washable as long as you remove your Kindle first (would I be liable for damages if I didn't say that???).  I was aware of the nature of silicone before ordering so didn't deduct anything for that.",

The first unit delivered came in damaged carton, with the ACER box put in a larger Amazon box with ONE piece of  packing paper and the Acer box \u201csloshed around\u201d the larger box.  I didn't realize the screen was  damaged until after everything was set-up.  Amazon replaced it quickly and picked up the bad unit, but it was a pain.  And surprisingly the replacement computer came packed exactly the same, but undamaged.<br /><br />The computer itself; Wow, Windows 8 has a huge learning curve and I'm still learning.  It may be lots better under the hood, but simple and intuitive like XP it's not.  I find the hand swiping not useful or easier than a wireless mouse.  Further I can't stand the finger swipes and prints on the screen.  It maybe more useful on a laptop (I don't mind it on my iPad) but on PC style it's not easier to reach for the screen than use the close by mouse.<br /><br />Had two dealings with Acer support, and I use the word support very loosely.  Jump through hoops (question after question) and everyone I spoke with had English as their second, or maybe their third language.  It's pretty clear every time you ask a question there is a delay while they look up the answer which is haltingly read to you and clearly the reader had no idea what they're saying.  If you ask any follow-up question the response is always to take the computer to an authorized Acer dealer.  They're really useless.  So you could buy a unit from someone that offers no live support as it's exactly the same.<br /><br />Here is my major complaint;  I intended to step up the RAM but that is no easy task.  Acer instructions wrongly state to remove the stand and some screws and \u201cslide\u201d off the back.  It doesn't slide, it is held in place with many unseen plastic clips.  Research will find YouTube and written instructions on how to pry the back off.  Everyone I found warns it will void your warranty (understand) and the fact that you will break a number of retaining clips during your removal.  Also, to attempt this it requires (because of a very small gap) a tool with the strength of a screwdriver, but no thicker than a credit card.  I guess there is such a tool, but I don't have one.  This should be a simple do at home upgrade and it isn't.  Not wanting to risk having some duct tape holding the back on, I've put off this upgrade.",

I have bought one, yes one, out of the 200+ books I have on my kindle. You have to scrounge and check frequently, but it is definitely worth it.  2. Battery life. Amazon lists the battery as lasting a month with regular use. Now, I can't say I know for sure if this is accurate, but I feel as if I hardly have to charge my kindle. I love not having to worry if the battery is low or remembering to plug it in every evening.  3. Amazon saves all your books to your account, even if you delete them from your kindle. I love this feature, I don't like my kindle being too cluttered, so this is a major help.  4. The ability to organize your books into collections. Again, organization is key.  5. Reading outside. I can't say that I agree there is 100% no glare, there is some, but its hardly something to complain about. My manager has a nook and hers was much much worse than my kindle, and really the kindle is minimum at best.  6. The easy ability to highlight, add notes or get word definitions. This is pretty self explanatory, but you move the cursor over the area you want to add the note (or highlight/find definition) while you're reading and it gives you the option.    Things I'm not so keen on:  1. The flash between pages, it just gets annoying after a while, especially if you're a quick reader like I am.  2. It's almost too lightweight. I like the feel of a book while I'm reading, but this was easily remedied by getting a case. It adds to the feel of a normal book while also keeping your kindle shipshape.  3. I wish you could choose the background for when your kindle goes into sleep mode. As it is there are 15 or so (I haven't really kept count) different images ranging from popular authors to the definition of the word kindle that switch each time the kindle goes to sleep. I don't care for all the images so its a small thing I wish I could customize.",

Probably about 4 hours then you'll have to recharge. This is one of the big drawbacks if you are using this Kindle for reading a lot of books. Battery life really needs improving. When I got my Fire, I expected to do a lot of reading and have the added advantage of internet connection, email, etc. The internet part is great; the reading is not. Just not enough battery life before having to recharge. It seems I'm constantly have to charge this thing. Also, Kindle books are WAY over priced. For an electronic book to cost what I would pay for a hardbound volume is a rip, especially considering the poor editing, missing pages, etc, I get with my ebooks. On the plus side, you can find some very good new authors who are writing good books that you can download for a low cost - .099 - $3.99. You just have to ignore the very poor editing.

Set up Set up was easy in the sense that there is almost no included documentation. You simply call support. They were US-based, helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. They guided me through the set up of both of the units. I'm fairly network savvy, but unless you're an IT professional in that exact field you'll never figure out the set up alone. Just call support. Seriously. They're rad. In fact, I'd recommend calling them before you purchase to discuss the right solution for your needs. EnGenius support = A+.  It's worth noting that one of my units is outside as directed; the other is actually inside but pointed towards a window. I know there is supposed to be absolute line of site between the units, but I do have some things in between (window, canvas curtain) and it's fine. And that is with the power turned way down on account of the short distance the signal needs to travel.  Also note that this isn't a substitute for a modem or a router. You will still need a modem in your main building, and a router in both buildings if you want wifi. These little guys are just to make the link between the buildings.  Results YMMV, but I'm experiencing no loss of speed whatsoever from the main network. None. It's freaking amazing. All my printers and network resources work seamlessly.

As to its features, its a curved keyboard which better follows the contour of your hands such that using the keyboard feels more natural and comfortable.  The extra buttons on top will work with your default [windows] media player and web browser, and then there is a calculator button (which works too).  I don't find them to be that useful myself, except the volume control buttons which do work with the overall system volume.  Play attention to the keyboard layout; not all layouts are the same and changing layouts always drives me crazy ... thus, my choice in this keyboard was not mistake.  The keyboard is quite low profile so it fits nicely under the keyboard tray.    So now for the cons, the keyboard may be curved but it is not truly ergonomic.  After four months of using the keyboard, my right wrist began to hurt quite a bit.  So much so, that my 12 lbs baby would almost bring me to tears if I supported her with that hand.  I program 8-12 hours a day, so I am a heavy user, I am right handed and do use a mouse often; with these things in mind, I know the keyboard alone cannot be the only factor leading to my wrist pain.  After learning about what is and isn't ergonomic, and therefore what is good and bad for my wrist, I learned that this keyboard had to be replaced or used much less frequently. I got an ergonomic MS Natural keyboard again and MS Natural mouse. After about two weeks, the pains have been greatly reduced.  I still like this keyboard but I cannot use it.  I would not recommend this for anyone with wrist pains such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel or other wrist repetitive activity issues.",

            "input": "There is a mixed report from someone using the pen (Echo 8GB) since over 2 years. As of this writing, there are three versions available: LiveScribe Echo (2GB), LiveScribe Wifi (various capacities) and LiveScribe 3 (various capacities).<br /><br />First, about the pro factors: The LiveScribe Echo (8 GB) that I am using since a long time is probably the most helpful invention since the ballpoint pen. It accompanies me everywhere, and I take lots of recordings. It changes the way I take notes, concentrating on the areas or topics discussed, rather than bothering taking detail notes. I'm setting aside all privacy concerns and assume you're doing the right thing, i.e., asking your discussion partners for their consent to record the meeting.<br /><br />Having said that, here are the negative ones: Quite apparently, LiveScribe is trying to shape the market to what it thinks it should look like, rather than what it actually looks like. Their later products offer less functionality, and while they make them look like upgrades, they in fact are substantial downgrades. Plus, they ignore customer reported weaknesses of the products.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />1) LiveScribe Wifi: This pen removes the ability to synchronize your content with your device directly, as you can with the Echo. In other words, while before you had an (admittedly, slow) USB connection and could work completely offline, with &#34;cloud&#34; an option you only needed if you wanted to put data / pen casts directly in their proprietary format on e.g. your IPad, you now are forced to go through Evernote.<br /><br />Counter-arguments:<br /><br />a) If I am happily recording a meeting where even everyone consented, chances are, they're less than happy with my pushing that content through the cloud.<br />b) If I'm in meetings, I've very typically not a Wifi connection, and if so, it may be weak.<br /><br />So in summary, the Wifi pen by and large removes your control over your data. If your pen breaks forsome reason, like my 8GB did recently, your data is lost as you may not have had the option of going online with the pen.<br /><br />And here's an added argument against it:<br /><br />c) From all I see, the Wifi option consumes substantially more energy then the USB version of the pen, which is not surprising, of course: Using the USB option, as you plug your pen into the computer, you're charging it as well.<br /><br />2) LiveScribe 3: While the Wifi &#34;only&#34; removes your control over your data to a large extent, the &#34;3&#34; version is even worse. And I don't even think about the blue light which you can cover or switch off, more substantially, if I do one thing very very regularly, it is recording phone conversations. Guess what, while you're not only bound to having your phone not run out of battery as you are recording a meeting, the moment you are actually having a phone conversation, you cannot record using live scribe 3. So this pen is just a massively overpriced handwriting scanner where you could use one of the much cheaper ones that use a special paperclip and ultrasound location; all it does in addition is to remote-control the recording app on your iphone/ipad.<br /><br />3) Removal of higher capacity pens: At least in some European countries, it is factually impossible to order 8GB versions. I just ran into a situation where, for all it appears, the USB chip on my pen stopped working, and while I'm happy to having lost probably only one recording, I cannot order a replacement. I went on and purchased a 2 GB Echo, as it is the only one that I got (and I calculated my most intensive recording having been 290 hours for one A5 notebook, which means, I'll probably get away even with less memory as they say they can record 200 hours on 2 GB (after removal of the tutorial, the pen actually shows about 1500 MB).<br /><br />4) The problem with the USB port chip (and also others, like a display blackout which others have observed) are reported often,and not fixed.<br /><br />5) The Echo features an SDK which Livescribe has decided to withdraw without replacement, to the great annoyance of their community.<br /><br />6) Despite many requests of people for Livescribe to provide assistance on how to come up with a Y-type of microphone connector that will record Phone conversations, they actively refuse to do so on the grounds of not supporting &#34;Spy&#34; usage of their pens. They should leave legal decisions on how to use their products to their customers rather. In fact, if they have that potential issue on their end, they should remove recording altogether, from their product (which they admittedly do, in a way, with their &#34;3&#34; version.)<br /><br />So in summary, LiveScribe has an excellent product, which is called the Echo. If you can get it, get three. If you get those 8GB versions, even better. I'm getting some of them now, and just remove the battery so it doesn't suffer (easy to do, just remove the front cap, unscrew four screws, remove the battery connector towards the tip of the pen, which is just fixed with some scotch tape.<br /><br />HTH,<br /><br />M",

On August 1st I bought this drive because of favorable reviews here at Amazon.<br />I have no complaints against the drive, it seems first rate, but I do want to warn other consumers about the bundled Nero 9 software. It's monstrous.<br /><br />To begin with, the installation on my machine (Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit), was a mess. The first thing it did was to try (aggressively!), to install the infamous ASK? toolbar. This practice is reprehensible. Google does it, Micosoft's Bing, and Yahoo, as well. There's a lot of money in search-engines and they're tactics are becoming borderline criminal.<br />I can almost forgive Google since their search-engine is genuinely great. The others are garbage, with ASK? the worst of the lot.<br />Despite specifically (Un-Checking) the ASK? install box, Nero forced it onto my machine anyway.<br /><br />Next, I was informed that my new complimentary software would not allow movie viewing beyond a 30-day trial period...UNLESS...<br />I was willing to cough up another $54, or so, for an upgrade. This is bait-and-switch. If it's not illegal, it's certainly sleezy.<br />I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and proceeded with the trial run. It then went to the Nero site and began...<br />...Are you ready?...a half-hour long, 180 Mb download of the software. (Then, what's on the installation disc?)<br /><br />On top of all of this the program was unintuitive, confusing, and even has a butt-ugly interface. I couldn't remove it fast enough.<br />One favorable point, it un-installs very smoothly. Just two crashes, warning screens, and multiple automatic re-starts.<br />Thank God, I had the forsight to make a Restore Point for once. It saved my bacon.<br /><br />What adds to my dismay, is that I bought an LG DVD-drive at Best Buy some five years ago. It also came with Nero software bundled. Specifically, Nero 7 Essentials and something called CyberLink DVD Suite and PowerDVD. Both have fairly ugly interfaces and PowerDVD is slightly buggy. Nevertheless, both have served me well. But, Nero 9 is garbage. I will have nothing to do with Nero after this. It's always sad when companies take a good product and then \\\\\"fix it\\\\\" until it's worthless, or poison the waters with upgrade traps. For me, Nero is dead. I may consider Roxio if I should need a future DVD package. I still think this drive is great, but have no illusions that you are getting full functioned free software<br />....your not.<br />I have returned to my old software bundle. Five years old, but it works and it came without a sucker punch.<br /><br />A quick follow-up. I had just finished struggling with Nero 9 when I wrote my scathing review. After an hour or two to cool off, it occured to me that I might have been unfair to Nero. After all, other reviewers had good things to say about it. So, to be fair, maybe I did rush through the installation procedure and missed some things. It's possible. I stand by my original conviction that the software is ugly and unituitive, but perhaps others can give it a fairer shake. Just wanted to be a little more balanced.PowerDVD is slightly buggy.

Our router (310N) and adapter (WUSB600N) work flawlessly.     The WGA600N gradually deteriorated to 1 bar out of 4 on the XBOX connectivity test. This happened over the course of a mere 5 1/2 months from the date of purchase in late May of 2009. Initially the gaming adapter was around 18ft. from the router without obstructions. Self diagnostic tests typically showed signal strength of 52-65%. We then relocated the adapter to within 10ft. of the access point and the signal was still poor. After 3 extended sessions with tech support the adapter showed no improvement. As of yesterday the adapter completely failed to connect, despite its function lights showing the contrary. Please note all of our other devices are functioning at peak levels. Our remedy is to replace the unit free of charge. Unfortunately, we have to pay the shipping bill to the return center.    Other problems exist with accessing the administration pages. At best, it was hit or miss with the program loading properly. I'm hoping this is a defective unit because I've never had as many issues with any wireless device. Otherwise, this adapter needs to be reengineered.    After countless hours of frustration we have purchased the proprietary XBOX wireless N adapter. Spend a little extra for your wireless gaming and bypass the headache. Plug and plays sounds awfully good at this point. The replacement WGA600N provided to us by Linksys will function as a backup or secondary choice for another gaming console. Might even use it for the Dish Network DVR. Do yourself a favor and buy the XBOX 360 specific adapter. Performance has to be better.    UPDATE:  The XBOX 360 Wireless N Adapter performs beyond expectations. The connectivity test on XBOX LIVE registers at 4 out of 4 bars. We also tested our wireless network map and it read at the 100% signal level. The physical distance between the routerand XBOX wireless adapter is about 18 feet with a wall separating the devices. Thus far we are enjoying lag free wireless gaming.",

This WebCam replaces my HP 1.3M WebCam [[ASIN:B000O77T3K HP RD345AA 1.3 Megapixel Webcam for Notebooks]].     INSTALLATION: 3 Stars [Update process could have been smoother]  Out of the box, the package warns you in several places not to plug the camera in until you have installed the software. They even put a small cover on the USB plug with a message on the cable. Very effective. I turned off AntiVirus protection per the instructions and then installed the software. I enabled automatically check for updates. It said no updates were found. Then I plugged in the camera.  After full install, it said updates were available and gave me a link to the website where I was supposed to select my camera, operating system, file version, etc.... I closed that link and found the \\\\\"Check for Updates\\\\\" link within the software (Right click on the Logitech Camera icon in the System Tray).  That worked smoothly without intervention from me. It updated my software from version 11.1 to 11.5.      IMAGE: 5 Stars  The 2 MP camera produces very clear images that work great on Skype.  Motion is no longer blurry, and the autofocus works great. The specifications say the autofocus will not work closer than 10 cm, but I find that if you move in slowly, it will work as close as 4 or 5 cm.  This is great if you want to show something up close like an image from your digital camera or a label on a product.      SOUND: 5 Stars  The built in Microphone combined with the Logitech noise reduction software eliminated all the echos and howling that I expereienced with my previous camera.  I no longer have to yell to be heard. I can speak in a normal voice, or even from across the room, and my sound is crystal clear.  Flawless.    CLIP: 3 Stars  The clip for this device does not hold it securely.  The camera can easily be pulled left or right if the USB cable is tugged even slightly. The rubber feet on the clip seem robust, yet it seems to be delicately balanced on the edge of my monitor.  It doesn't fall off, but it is not a solid perch. The camera can be independently tilted up and down, but not left and right.  There is no option for clipping the camera to the side of the monitor.  The included stand works decently.  It is made of three pieces that fit together and then the camera clips to the top.  I placed the stand behind my laptop and it worked very well...peering over the top.  Unfortunately, you cannot adjust height of this stand.  I will probably not bring this on future trips.    SPECIAL FEATURES: 2 Stars  There is a thin button across the top of the camera that allows you to take still photos. I found the camera button was too easy to press while trying to adjust the camera.  And since the camera does not clip securely, trying to press this button almost requires two hands...one to steady the camera and the other to push the button. The included software allows Avatars to imitate your facial expressions in place of your real image.  You can also add special effects like hats, arrows through your head, or goatee and mustache. When it works, this is a really neat feature that my kids loved! But, even though it was neat, something in that feature conflicted with my Symantec Antivirus. As soon as I turned antivirus back on, turning on these neat video features forced my machine into an immediate shutdown! I got a BSOD followed by a hard shutdown that I haven't seen since Win95! My machine hung in a state of limbo.  The power button wouldn't turn it off (software driven) but the machine as powered up with a blank screen.  I had to pull the plug and remove the battery to complete the shutdown.  Each time I turned that feature on while using Antivirus, my computer gave me the BSOD and performed an immediate and hard shutdown.  Needless to say, I no longer use these special features.    AUTO FACE TRACKER: ?  This is a neat feature, but I do not find it useful.  It really does a great job of following my face, but at what price?  It seems like the other person would get seasick watching the background bob and weave as the software followed my head around.  I think I am used to seeing the background stay put, while the person moves around in the frame.  Anything else is disconcerting.  Since I don't care for this feature, I did not rate it.  You may find it entertaining.    ACCESORIES: 5 Stars  The included soft-sided pouch, along with the velcro strap for wrapping the USB cord are nice touches as I plan to use this for travel.  Why don't more manufacturers offer these nice touches?     OVERALL REVIEW: 4 Stars  The video and sound are superb, and that is what really counts. But it seems that logitech could take one more step forward and improve the software to eliminate glitches with anti-virus, improve the software update process, and design a more robust clip. With a few minor changes this would easily be a 5-star item.      RECOMMENDATION:  After trying several different brands and models, this one had the best price/performance.  Cheaper ones left me wishing I had better video. More expensive ones had me wondering why they cost so much when this one offers everything I need. I would recommend purchasing this item.",

It docks perfectly with my keyboard dock and the great thing is I don't have to take it out of the case to dock it. There is also a cover that you can protect the screen with when you are not using it, which also converts to a stand for you to sit the iPad on if you don't want to hold it or lay it flat. Also, I didn't think it was bulky like other reviewers said. I think it is worth the money and great protection for your iPad.

I'm very careful about wiping it down using only clean microfiber lens cloths and use a stylus (also kept clean) probably 90% of the time yet it still begins accumulating scratches almost immediately upon installation.

The keyboard is very soft and easy to press and type. <br />2. There is build in microphone and speaker which is easy for me to chat with the other friend online. <br />3. The mouse pad is very smooth and the mouse movement is easy to control with my finger. <br />4. The pen that use for writting, erase, touch, click, db click is really comfortable like i write my own pen on the paper. The screen is really smooth and recognize a lot of difficult character that i have written. Sometime i suruprise because some text i difficult to be recognize but this tablet could convert it into a digital text is very easy. <br />5. The dimension is done in a good design for people to handle it for use on the way. <br />6. The battery life is 4 hours but as I remember during the time that i use the logest battery life is 3h 30mn. But it is OK for me because i always plug the power cord to charget the battery when the system has no more power. <br /> <br />OK, the below thing is the negative point that i think that toshiba would change it for the next release device: <br /> <br />1. In the software manual it indicate that there is a reserve pen in the machine near the battery. But in fact when i check for the reserve pen it is not include with this tablet pc. I also check the computer shop and they told me that the reserve pen is not included bye default. I don't understand about this issue too. <br />2. There is only one Ctrl key atthe left side, when i need to type any text that require to use the right Ctrl, i found it is very difficult to use it. On the other hand, the windows key is not locate at the under left hand. It is locate at the upper right of the keyboard. <br />3. There is less port for other device to be connect. There is no PS/2 port, LPT1 port. The port is develope in part of R10-P2301. There is no internal floopy drive, it include in the necessary option. <br />4. The wirless network is disconnect in every 10Mn.

With all due respect that is why i purchased this card not so you can bend me over and screw me into buying another card so i could do the things that you said i would be able to do from the very beginning and with all the new capture cards popping up on the market that can do the same and if not more than this capture card can do at a far cheaper price it is in the words of President obama, \\\\\"its Imperative\\\\\" that you drop the price at least $40-$50 to compete with the others because this product seemed unready for the Hyped claims behind it as if it were massed produced before it was properly fully tested?...Please take these words with my deepest condolences.",

If you press a key a bit off center or not perfectly straight down, then the key sticks and won't go down.  If you type fast like I do, you will type a couple of characters past the key that stuck before you can stop, then you have to delete those characters and start again.  It is terribly frustrating.  I find this design flaw absolutely inexcusable from someone like Logitech who has been making keyboards for decades.  Especially for a keyboard that costs this much.  I have typed on many keyboards in my life, and this is the worst.  If you are a hunt-and-peck typist, then maybe this keyboard could work for you; if you can actually type well, then you WILL be disappointed!      My second complaint about the keyboard is that it has no NumLock key.  I know most people don't use the number pad to arrow through documents, but I do.  When I was a software engineer, I learned that it was the fastest way to put my cursor where I wanted it to be in my code; the End, Home, Page up, Page Down, Delete, Enter, and arrow keys are all right there in intuitive locations, and you don't need to look at the keyboard to use them.  Definitely speeds up document editing.  But my biggest problem with the lack of the NumLock key is WHY?  WHY remove it?  Does it confuse other users to have it?  Did it make the keyboard somehow easier to use or cheaper to make?  NO!  So WHY would they piss of the few people who use the numpad for the arrows?  It's admittedly maybe .5% of their consumer base, but it's not zero!  DUH!  You can remap keys within windows via registry settings, which I did, but what a pain!    As for the mouse, it is pretty goofey, and I had to set up one of the buttons to be \\\\\"middle click\\\\\" (it doesn't have a middle button by default and the scroll wheel does not click), but it works acceptably well and I have no real complaints.    Range and battery life are both excellent.    Okay, so to sumup, this keyboard sucks.",

The shape is not conducive to normal sized notebooks, binders, textbooks, folders, etc. It doesn't open wide enough to easily pull anything out. In addition, the zippered pocket on the front on top doesn't work for me.  I have to be careful of what I put in there because if it's too heavy (such as a calculator, chapstick, or lotion), it folds the front flap in half when the main zipper is open. While the backpack holds a lot (even my 17 inch laptop), it is an inefficient design, and I would not recommend it. The weight of the handle on top is really what irritates me the most.",

This Skinomi shield makes install easier:  because you spray down the shield, you can actually move it around once it's on the iPad and place it perfectly around the cut outs.<br /><br />I've only installed the front at the moment, and it looks perfect.  The trick is to carefully squeegee after installation, trying to get the bigger bubbles out and letting it dry for a few minutes. At that point you will see bubbles you might have missed, so I carefully squeegeed those bubbles out (it helps if you rewet the surface of the shield so that the little plastic squeegee glides easier). That got rid of most bubbles. You will see streaks, those do not squeegee out, it takes an overnighter for them to evaporate out.<br /><br />So my shield not looks really nice.  So why one star off?  The top is a little more rubbery than I am used to, so sometimes my nail digs in a bit, but that's a minor complaint. As well, the black cleaning cloth they give you actually can shed a little bit, and on a white iPad it did peace a black speck or two under the shield right against the white border, making it very visible. You then have to rewet your fingers, lift up the shield, and try to scrape that off the shield. Luckily, wetting your fingers mean that no fingerprints will deposit, so it worked out. But if you have a white iPad, find a white microfiber cloth to clean the screen before install.  Or be more careful in ensuring that no black specks are present.<br /><br />Overall great product and quick delivery!",

After looking at a couple of choices, I settled on this card.  (Another review I had read said it worked with Windows 7, as does StarTech's site.)    Installation was painless, if a bit difficult to decipher due to less than perfect documentation translation.  The card worked perfectly with the internal SATA port.  Problem arose when you attached an eSATA disk.  When you shut down (or restarted) Win7, it would sync the file systems, park the disks, but wouldn't go the last step and actually power off.  You had to hold the power button to power off.  I tried the drivers that came with the card and the one's on StarTech's website, both failed the same way.    So, it was off to JMicron's web site and downloaded the latest drivers for the JMB36X controller this card uses.  (YMMV, it works for me.  Version 1.17.57.1 as of when I've written this.)    Works as advertised now.  Transfer rates (though I haven't benched it yet) looks okay, shutdown and restart works, eSATA port reports as ejectable.  The new drivers even mark the disks correctly in the device manager.  (miniport scsi...)    I've let StarTech know, I'll update this if they actually get back to me.    I'd give this 5 stars for a cheap internal/external sata card, one star off for not coming with a working driver. :-)",

So I contemplated either getting a wireless bridge or buying a powerline network kit.  The rule of thumb being to reduce complexity of your home WIFI network, I decided to go with the Zinwell powerline adapter.  I am glad I did, it literally took 5 minutes to setup and I get 3X the speed of my wireless network!  But more importantly, the network is MUCH more stable than it was with WIFI.  I have streamed hours of video flawlessly to my TV since I installed it.  Worth noting:  1) The mac mini is on a different circuit than the router.  2) I can consistently get 10mb/s across the powerline network.  3)It's plug and play.  Easy as pie.

It just unfolds and locks in to place. It is quite a genius design. I am not sure this thing would work for big, heavy laptops I would keep it 15\\\\\" and under, but for a MacBook Pro 13\\\\\" this thing would probably rock. My DJ controller fits fine underneath and everything has been great over 3 weeks of DJ gigs. Highly recommended!!! As an update, I now use this to hold my ipad when I am djaying using Traktor DJ. I keep my iPad in a case and put it on the stand and it works great for djaying! Double recommend!!!",

Signing in Skype was what took me the most time, because I had to figure out of to make CAPS/NUMS for the password. The rest was fine. The voice quality is as good as it gets. I had a DUALPhone for a year, and it was never as good as this one. I like being computer free, as I don't have to dedicate CPU cycles from one laptop or PC to the Skype line. In all, after over a month of use, I am happy with it.    Here are my two suggestions. The volume of the rings is pretty low at its highest setting. So if you happen to have a loud environment or a large house, you may miss calls cause you will not hear the phone if you are far from the set (unless you have multiple handsets). This is something Phillips should consider improving.    The other annoying thing is about the call waiting feature. The double beep or so when someone else is \\\\\"calling\\\\\" you, does not seem to go away when the awaiting party hangs. So, if you ignore the call from the other person while in an important conversation, you may expect to hear the nagging beep for the duration of the call. This is not a big deal for me, as I almost never get into this situation, and also, it may have a simple workaround.    I benefited from the forums where some other issues where addressed, such as making SkypeOut calls to a number out of your contact list, and making some config choices out of the defaults to make it more friendly for people who do not have a landline.",

Cable management is not easy but it's worth the time.  I spent a lot of time on cable management and it came out great. I routed wires between the fans and behind the fans.    I installed 5 Noctua 120mm case fans. In order to get the 3rd fan in the front I had to remove a drive cage. But Silverstone anticipated this and used screws to secure that drive cage rather than rivets. Kudos Silverstone!    There's enough space behind the front cover to store a couple spare SSDs and flash drives.  I installed a couple thumb screws to secure the cover. They call the regular screws \\\\\"added security\\\\\". That's funny :-).    A couple very minor Cons:  The left edge of my front cover is sharp and scratched me when I brushed my hand against it. The right side is smooth. No blood, I'm fine, thank you for your concern.    I don't much care for the fact that there are no screw holes on the left side of the 5 1/4\\\\\" exposed drive bays.

That is probably not an issue with most since the bulk may provide more protection. But I prefer slimmer and lighter. The other issue is that there is not an opening to the charging port when the case is closed. So you have to leave the case open when charging. This is an issue for me because I have cats that tend to walk all over my desk when I'm not around. I know this may sound like a negative review but really it isn't.

Book selection is adequate.  4. It visually looks OK    Weaknesses:  1. The largest weakness is that the screen is not backlit. Reading is difficult in poor light and an accessory is needed to read in bed at night with the lights out. There should be an optional backlight button that will burn battery life but give you that extra 20 minutes you need without having to buy a cover, clip-on light and batteries.   2. Navigation is not terrific. This is clearly no Apple design. You have a toggle switch, forward and backward buttons; and a keypad. Not to mention a power-slide switch, etc...  3. You cannot clip newspaper coupons, some delivery days are absent from our newspapers and for some newspapers, some graphics are emitted.  4. The newspaper and magazine selection is still pretty limited.  5. You cannot print.  6. Unless I am mistaken, you cannot easily skim through a book or newspaper. There is no fast forward or 'skip-a-chapter' feature.  7. There are some slow functions such as waking from sleep.  8. It is not very ergonomic. Just grab it to carry it without a cover and you may accidentally press a button.  9. The main screen where you see your list of purchased items does not convey the full names of items with long titles. One shouldn't have to shrink the text.  10. I can skim through a physical newspaper faster than the newspaper version of the kindle.  11. Almost no skins.   12. A little overpriced.    Summary:  The Kindle 2 is excellent for waiting in lines, traveling, and getting the morning paper. It will even save money on books and newspaper subscriptions (minus the coupon issue). For those of us old enough to have a lifetime of joy reading real books and newspapers, it is absolutely no substitute for holding a hardcover of a great novel but where doing so is difficult or inappropriate, it is an excellent device to have.",

Because the cable is supposed to go in at an angle on the hdx to charge, it seems harder to put it through the case, it works but a little more space around that opening would be nice. The buttons are a little tough to press for a child so she needs someone to turn the kindle on for her. Aside from that I'm pretty happy with the purchase.",

Now go into control panel, view by (small icons) then click on blackmagic design control panel. You should be on the settings tab. Output should be at default (HDMI & Component) and then set input as (Component Video & Analog RCA Audio) Click Apply then Ok. Now under all programs open up Blackmagic Media Express. Click the View tab and select Compact. This will make the window easier to play with. Now click the edit tab. The first drop down will have a list of formats to choose from.

You want to select NTSC (should be the first one on top) Capture File Format set to AVI Motion JPEG if you have a single hard drive. Then Check the Continue playback when in the background box. Then hit ok. Now that you're back at the media express window, select the CAPTURE tab or MASTER to show something on the screen.

Knowing that I did not want a Kindle ( Was not a supported devise at my Library) I started my search.   I was looking at both readers and tablets and was almost set on buying the Nook Color when I saw the T301 on Amazon.  After reading the specs, reviews both here and at Cnet and also the fact that the player was $177.00 ( and I had a $20.00 GF ) I must say that after an initial learning curve the first night I am very pleased with this very affordable tablet.  Is it an ipad?  No, of course not, but you get a lot of bang for your buck and as a small, fit in your bag, portable device you really can't go wrong.  As far as down loading apps, just by pass loading directly from Cruz market, and use your computer to go to the app site, and down load directly on to your dedicated SD card, then just open and download.  This this  is only 2.0 android, but as long as you don't try to download any app that needs higher, you should not have a problem.   The Cruz comes with a 4GB SD card, I have already purchased a 32GB as I can tell I will need it.  The nice thing is you can run multiple cards ( one for Video, one for books), and pop them in and out depending on what you want at the time if you exceed 32 GG ( or 4 GB) I down loaded some video and it plays great!!  I totally recommend this for anyone who wants a reader + tablet for under $200.00",

For the longest time, I have been hesitating to buy LED monitors because I hate the dingy dull blue tint that they all inherently enjoy.  Enter the P2715Q.  This monitor not only overrides the aforementioned attributes, but improves the image quality of the CCFL to an extent, I never thought possible.  Placed side by side with the HP, the HP looks like the LED :).  I bought a pair directly from Dell for around $500/ea. Great job Dell!! This has been the best $1000 I've spent in years..",

I was surprised to find I'd been on for almost 2 hours when I finally closed the laptop's screen.  The fan plugs in USB & ran so quietly that I didn't think it was on.  I had to touch the fan's covering to make sure it was working.  It was.  I love that this pad gives my laptop a few inches of height to use the keyboard more easily.  I also love that I can unplug it when I'm not using my laptop.  The plug tucks away under the bottom of the pad for easy storage.  This cooling pad is well worth your money.

Using the drive is pretty straightforward, it pops up as a drive under the \\\\\"network\\\\\" on my windows PC.  One big gripe I had about the cloudbox is their misleading advertising on their website. It claims on the page that sharing files with others is easy through secure download links. This is a feature of dropbox that I used a lot and was excited to have that option with my entire library on my networked drive.  There is no documentation in the manual about how to do this, and after speaking with lacie, they told me it was not possible to do with the cloudbox.  I pointed out that it's listed as a feature of the cloudbox on their site, they apologized and said they would have their marketing dept look into it, but as of this review it's still listed as a feature.  The remote access app on my iphone does connect to the cloudbox, but even over lte it is painfully slow.  Bottom line is that it does offer a lot of networked storage that I can share with my family, but the features are limited and the iphone app looks and performs half-baked.

I guess the only negative thing I could say is that the backlight is significantly obscured (at least by the purple one). Honestly, though, I care more about whether it's a good fit, so I love it.

If you use your lappie a lot like me, and carry it all over the place then you will probably notice that you can start to see the outline of your keys on the screen when you clean it, this will prevent that from occurring too. The only issue I really had with this, besides the image itself, was after about a month of use one of the corners got some dust under it, and did the obligatory lift. Of course that is through constant use, in and out of my backpack and carrying it wherever i went. Other than that I would recommend this to save your screen and reduce the glare.",

Web browsing is agile and I connected it to my HP Printer through the Google Cloud Print service, so I can read my emails, open attachments, and print them from the Chromebox. It is not a device for everyone, but if you basically need to surf the web, access web applications, and stream video, this Chromebox is ideal.",

The problems started when trying to clone my existing HDD to the SSD. No matter what cloning program I used, I couldn't get anything to work correctly. After three days of trying to clone my existing drive, I decided to do a clean Windows 7 install...20 minutes later, I was up and running! Had no problems installing any of my old programs.<br /><br />The 830 SSD is blazing fast, it scored a perfect 7.9 in my Windows Experience testing. I've had it up and running for a few months now and I love it! The computer's start-up times alone make the SSD upgrade worth it!",

The disc may be helpful (I didn't use it), but it is not necessary if you are electronic savvy. Make sure both devices Bluetooth are on and find the keyboard in the tablets Bluetooth connections. It can be a bit touchy sometimes. I find that if I type too fast some of my letters don't go through (even though I know I hit them), or I get double letters. It is nicer than using the screen though. If you have larger fingers or have a hard time seeing, remember that it is small so you may want to try something else. Though for the cost of everything else it would work as a back up, then just buy a larger keyboard.<br />I was going to purchase this for my mother as well but as it's no longer available I'll wait and see what else is out there.

I can access Youtube with no issues. I understand these files are not as huge as HD content. But I know it works ok wireless.<br /><br />I was able to set the up Seagate BlackArmor 4 TB server within minutes. I could find it on the network as well. Next thing I copied a .mkv file about 10 gigs in size. Took about 5 minutes to transfer. Turned on the WDTV and was able to find the network share drive from the Seagate. As soon as I tried to stream the video it just stood there not doing anything. There was no way I could get it to stream.<br /><br />Next thing I thought of was to change from Raid 1 to Raid 0 as I was under the impression it would increase performance. So it reformatted and I copied the file again. Same thing...the file loaded but would not play.<br /><br />So next I tried it wired using the Gigabit Port connection on the D-Link. Same results. These files simply would not stream.<br /><br />Since I had my WDTV Live already set up wireless I could access another drive inside the PC: [[ASIN:B001GQYYSQ Western Digital 640 GB Caviar Black SATA 7200 RPM 32 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive WD6401AALS [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]]]<br />I was able to stream the exact same file with no errors wireless. No hiccups or errors...Exactly what I was hoping to achieve with the Seagate.<br /><br />Why is this happening ? If you know something I don't please let me know. I would be more than happy to change this review. The only thing I could think of is the actual drive speed being too slow???<br /><br />The Seagate is going back to Amazon.

You can kind of force it on with a case on, I am using the Samsung Book Cover, but I don't suggest trying it.  Perhaps a slimmer case would work, but I also put my GS4 on there with its slim tpu case and it did not fit either.  I definitely recommend taking any case or cover off your device before placing it on this cradle or you risk damaging the micro usb port on your tablet.  The charging cable included is very short, so I also suggest being prepared for that.  It did work with my Samsung phone charger cable which is 6ft and plugged into a floor outlet at my desk.  The cable provided is more for hooking it up to a computer, so it is worthless if you want to leave your docking station in another location.  I have a phone charger at my desk, and another on my night stand so I have been just moving the dock to the location I want it.  Also, the tablet did not register the docking station as an accessory, meaning it is only a stand that charges.  If you want a docking station that sends the device into docking mode (clock displayed while cradled, more widgets displayed, etc.) you will need a compatible device.  So, in short I'd definitely recommend this docking station if you are looking for a cheap way to have your tablet stand and be able to charge while watching a movie or something and don't mind constantly taking off the cover and putting it back on.",

This means that whatever theoretical speed they are rated for, the REAL theoretical speed is HALF what is stated.  Wireless routers run &#34;full-duplex&#34; which means they transmit and receive simultaneously, on different frequencies.<br /><br />The manual seems incomplete.  I think the received signal strength indicator automatically turns off after a period of time but could not find mention of this anywhere in the manual.<br /><br />I personally couldn't get this thing to work using any of the three methods described but I'm not sure that is entirely the fault of the unit.  It may be a problem on my end.<br /><br />My old router is a Linksys WRT160n which has served me well but has built in internal antennas.  That makes it look very stylish on my desk, but I'm sure they are a compromise and not very efficient.<br /><br />After my failure with this device I did the research that I should have done before I bought it.  The tech articles I read indicated that this type of device is the absolute last option one should try when attempting to increase wifi coverage.  My final solution to the problem was to upgrade my 5 year old router with an ASUS RT-AC66U.  I added the Super Power Supply\u00ae 3 x 9dBi 2.4GHz 5GHz Dual Band WiFi RP-SMA Antenna for Routers.

Setup was straightforward and simple with the illustrated Quick Start Guide. I like how easily the Seagate Dashboard helped me publish content to social media sites and also to back up data to Cloud Storage, even though most of my usage was to back up document, photo and torrent files which I did manually. The unit stands vertically so the footprint is small. Everything worked perfectly until three months ago when I started getting bad sector messages. I began moving files over to a smaller Iomega backup device. Then my old faithful Dell began telling me it was time for an upgrade (I loved my Dell and trusty Windows XP so resisted upgrading as long as I could). Finally, it was time: I needed to reboot every other day.<br /><br />I transferred the Seagate drive to the new Windows 7 computer, but the bad sector problems continued. Finally, I couldn\u2019t boot up my computer and had to disconnect the Seagate Backup Plus. A shame really, because I liked the drive\u2019s functionality very much.

I haven't used Windows since the XP days. Been using Mac for 4 years and Linux for 3. I know Windows 7 was supposed to be better so I wanted to give it a shot before installing Linux. Windows takes FOREVER to load.The interface isn't responsive either. In one word I would say it is a terribly bloated mess.<br /><br />It's also pretty buggy. This is something I expect of Linux but a mainstream commercial operating system? The OS It has a fingerprint reader and I removed the function because it took even longer to boot. The function shows up as another user. Though I disabled it- it still showed up and then the control panel kept crashing and I kept being unable to change the settings. I couldn't stand Windows so I installed Linux. Opensuse and Linux Mint detected my hardware automatically. Still they were quite slow to boot. More stable than Windows but nothing like my Mac. Speed wise still not close.<br /><br />On to the actual hardware- the computer has pretty laughable build quality. Press the trackpad buttons- they are the flimsiest buttons I've ever pressed on any laptop and I've owned an Acer Aspire netbook. Consider that this computer, when new was over $1200 and more expensive than my Macbook. Screen is tolerable but the colors are pretty washed out. Webcam is really bad- like trying to film something with a potato. The good is that the keyboard is about the most comfortable I've used. From trackpad to screen each row of buttons rises up a bit. It is a very nice feeling ergonomic keyboard to use.<br /><br />In conclusion I plan to keep my Macbook and sell this computer off and wait another year until I can afford a new Mac. I just want a computer that just works. Maybe I can get it to work better if I put in an SSD but that my Mac with its 5200rpm drive and an outdated processor can mop thefloor with this computer shows that it just isn't worth struggling.",

I've used many different LCD monitors and while my favorite continues to be the Apple 20&quot; Cinema display, this is now my 2nd favorite (and as I am getting accustomed to the pivot feature, the Apple display may be in trouble...). Yes, it comes with a pivot display mount that not only allows you to raise, lower, tilt and turn the montior to any position imaginable, it also lets you rotate the screen 90 degrees to portrait mode. Unlike the more expensive rotatable monitors that have an 'auto-sensing' thingie which automatically switch your display output between portrait and landscape based on the position of the monitor, this one requires you to use a software utility (included) to manually select the orientation of the output. To be honest, I didn't even realize this was a feature on this monitor. I based my initial purchase decision on the manufacturer specs and price. Since this was intended to replace a 21&quot; Sony CRT on my development PC, image quality was secondary to form factor and price. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the display and I was extremely pleased to discover the rotation feature.<br /><br /> I was originally going to mount this monitor on a VESA arm, but after using the included stand, I'm having second thoughts. The stand itself is the best that I've ever seen on an LCD monitor. It allows for good cable management and almost infinite adjustability while not presenting a huge footprint.<br /><br /> Anyway, so far, this seems to be an outstanding monitor for the price (actually cheaper than many crappier 17&quot; LCDs I've seen). Though, you do need to shop around for the best price since I've seen it range from $549 to $800+. It's unusual to see such a wide range in the street price. I ended up getting it from Amazon because with the free 'super saver free shipping', it came out to be darn near the best deal (and I've had nothing but good experiences with Amazon so far).<br /><br /> Conclusion - do NOT buy one of these monitors!

The input from the stylus is picked up by the screen pretty much all the time and allows for much finer control, especially in free-form drawing apps like the recent Draw Something game. The fabric tip glides smoothly over the screen (I do not use a screen protector with my tablet), and is a bit \\\\\"spongy\\\\\" -flattening out to a more blunt tip when force is applied. I really like the smoothness with which the fabric tip moves over the screen -the tip material is the best feature of this stylus.<br /><br />The stylus works well, although I sometimes find myself wishing the tip was more firm. Due to the sponginess I have some difficulty highlighting when annotating *.pdfs of journal articles. Due to the level of zoom I typically read at, the lines of text are close enough together that I am frequently unable to precisely select a row of text without accidently selecting the row either above or below my intended target. I suspect this problem is amplified by the sponginess of the tip, causing the tip to \\\\\"spill over\\\\\" onto the surrounding lines of text.<br /><br />I find the length of the stylus to be too short by about an inch. I have medium-large sized hands in terms of glove-size. The side of my hand always seem to rub up against the pen clip when holding the stylus with a normal writing grip, which becomes uncomfortable over time. The pen clip is also too rigid as I am unable to get it to clip around the fabric at the top of my jeans pocket. I have also occasionally had issues with the click mechanism becoming jammed, but I have thus far always been able to un-jam the mechanism with only a minimal of fuss.",

At the time of purchase, it was one of the cheapest laptops you could purchase with a Haswell CPU. Intel's improved power efficiency and integrated graphics performance quite a bit over their last generation, so getting something with Haswell was a priority. The larger screen size surely doesn't hurt either!<br /><br />Of course, at this low of a price range, compromises have to be made. As noted by other reviewers, this laptop does not have integrated Bluetooth, although it is inexpensive to add an adapter post-purchase. The built-in WiFi and Ethernet adapters also leave quite a bit to be desired. The 802.11n WiFi is fairly run-of-the-mill basic performance, and the Ethernet is only 100 Mbps, not Gigabit. Transferring files internally within a network can be a bit slower with this system.<br /><br />The biggest compromise seems to have been with the hard drive. The 750 GB drive is spacious, but it is painfully slow. It's only 5400 RPM, and comes equipped with an absolute barebones 8 MB of cache. General use *will* be bottlenecked by the lack of disk performance. I upgraded this to a smaller 256 GB solid state drive, which substantially improved performance, somewhat lowered power consumption, and cut noise levels a bit.<br /><br />Again, it's hard to complain about a laptop in this price range. Overall, I'm satisfied with the reliability and performance of this system and would gladly choose to purchase this option again, given the opportunity.",

That is the other interface I want to talk about, simply by connecting with my laptop to the device and entering 10.10.10.254 (in browser) another beautiful interface comes up, again much better than the one for the WD01, and it helped me set up wifi, change the SSID, setup a password, etc.<br />This is a huge improvement compared to the WD01 (I have never used a WD02 so I can't say much about it), completely worth it, the only negative thing I can say is that it is so great that now I won't use my new WD01 as much.<br />If you're interested in knowing all the things it can do more than the improvements from previous versions, here are some of my favorites:<br />-You can attach an SD card AND a flash drive/external hard drive to it and access those wirelessly from any smartphone and computer, like your own personal cloud, you can even stream videos from it (I'm not sure what is the maximum amount of devices it can handle at once, but it is at least 5).<br />-You can have it connect automatically to wifi networks, so if you connect a device to the WD03 for file stuff, you can still access the Internet from your device, and never worry about switching between networks.<br />-You can literally use the WD03 as a router, imagine having a router that at the same time is your personal cloud, great for everybody at home.<br />-You can charge your smartphone with the WD03, 6000mAh is a lot, if the other uses were not enough to bring this with you every day, this should change that (just the charging function is enough reason for me).<br />-You can check the battery level by clicking its button, simple, yet great.<br />It has even more uses, I recommend this, nice design, beautiful interfaces, so many uses, just great overall.<br />(The device is turned on in the pictures I took because I was already using it)terally use the WD03 as a router, imagine having a router that at the same time is your personal cloud, great for everybody at home.<br />-You can charge your smartphone with the WD03, 6000mAh is a lot, if the other uses were not enough to bring this with you every day, this should change that (just the charging function is enough reason for me).<br />-You can check the battery level by clicking its button, simple, yet great.<br />It has even more uses, I recommend this, nice design, beautiful interfaces, so many uses, just great overall.<br />(The device is turned on in the pictures I took because I was already using it)",

Aside from its weathered and faded appearance, the book is very attractive.  The red felt interior keeps the Mac cushioned and scratch free so far, while the tan leather lining gives a nice touch.  There are two nylon type corner straps to attach the monitor to the book cover, but I've found them to be unnecessary since the BookBook cover prefers to be closed stays relatively close to the Mac's lid stays. Time will only tell if this feature keeps up. I have taken the book out of the case a double of times to check for heat build up but haven't found any problems at all.  I must note, I do tend to keep my desktop fairly clean, no more than four or five programs running at a time, but so far, I have had no heat related concerns.

The built-in RAID setup is great. Also, a great feature is the built-in WIFI directly into the motherboard. After turning the unit on, the WIFI paired easily with Windows 8.1 to locate the WIFI signal and allow me to log in.    Bear in mind that this motherboard is ideally designed for those who want professional level rendering and video creation and not ideal for gamers, hobbyists, or simple hardware junkies. Much of the heft of this unit supports those who need high CPU and memory output for video creation. Gamers will get nearly identical speed or quality out of a more affordable board (e.g. Asus X97) and investment in a quality video card.",

For people who keep hardware a long time (things like screens, speakers, mice, and keyboards don't become obsolete nearly as quickly as GPUs, CPUs or RAM) this is a good investment.<br /><br />I was able to calibrate it using a borrowed X-Rite from 2005.  By calibrate, I mean adjust the RGBCYMK settings until most dE's were as improved as they could be.  The yellow-ish range is still way out (dE 11+) and nothing I can accomplish fixes it without messing up everything else.<br /><br />I looked on the box but was unable to determine a revision number.  That said, I do _not_ have the horizontal-line problem that seems to plague these displays.  I feel like internet reviews are more likely to be left for negative experiences, so the sample size skews toward those with problems, giving an impression a product has more issues than it actually does.<br /><br />Games run just fine--I notice no input lag or ghosting despite not being in &#34;game&#34; mode.  I am referring to StarCraft II, Borderlands 2, and Mass Effect 3 here.  I can see the frustration with the touch controls but they aren't nearly as bad to me as some reviews have suggested they would be.

I got 2 cables mSAS-to-4 SATA for my RAID project + 8 pcs HDD from amazon too.<br />1 step- the controller BIOS was old and need to be updated. With old BIOS the controller do not support 3 Tb HDD. Update was done in 15 minutes. It easy- just need to follow the README.<br />2 step- i was build a RAID. It's also easy to do using controller menu command line.<br />After reboot my PC- my WIN 7 x64 PC with latest adaptec software versions including WIN 7 x64 driver was detected my RAID like 2.75 Tb logical drive only.<br />I read all about similar problems on the adaptec forum and... It's something new. O, i was a pioneer. Probably no many guys using server controller under Windows 7. Linux or 2003 server- for sure- many. But Win7+ adaptec witch cost 1.5 grand 1 year ago-maybe just only crazy guys like i was.<br />So, i was following instruction and create a ticket online on adaptec web site. It's hapen 6 months afer i try the controller first time(because of my job away from home). After around 20-30 days adaptec reliese new drivers and controller BIOS. I install it and... all works fine till now!<br />Look like nobody tested controller on similar platform to my PC. But software, according to adaptec controller description, must support my platform fully. I still have problems with ASM on the same PC even with last version of ASM and drivers.

I've read that it doesn't work so well with certain games (Shift + W + Space), but then the average luxury sedan doesn't do very well on the drag strip either.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a coder's keyboard. It feels great under the fingers and unlike so many other keyboards today, Logitech has kept it standard. No unnecessary extra buttons, no rearrangement/removal of home/end/pageUp/pagedown.<br />Even though I was a bit displeased with Logitech messing up the layout with the big delete button, I've found it to be not too much of a bother because [insert] is still above delete. Also, if you use the context-menu button, they've moved that too, but it's still there!<br /><br />And that's why I like this keyboard. It's standard, but soo very wonderful to type on and fairly durable.<br /><br />Other reviews mention keys falling off or the keyboard itself falling apart, I recommend you not drop it. It's a fairly heavy keyboard, so it's not for the lap and probably won't like being dropped. If you're not using it at a desk, buy something else.<br /><br />That said, this keyboard has been in heavy daily use for over 2 years now, and has seen its fair share of dust and ash and just keeps on going.

Most of the plugs on this device are sufficiently separated that device plugs don't interfere with each other.<br /><br />Finally, I wanted something with a moderately short cord. Six feet is not short, but most of the flat-plug surge protectors I found had longer cords. This needs to go a whopping one foot, so the less slack the better. You will be hard pressed to find a shorter cord than six feet without going into the realm of &#34;I would be scared to plug in anything more expensive than an alarm clock&#34; surge protectors.<br /><br />If I find myself needing another surge protector, I would strongly consider purchasing another one of these.",

So let\u2019s get in to the review:<br /><br />Probably MOST IMPORTANT I NEED with a case for my devices is GRIP, and has to have a comfortable feel for hold for long periods of time. This out of all other aspects is an absolute deal breaker to me, and this also what I have trouble finding most with case especially with my Galaxy S4, but I digress. With the size of the iPad Mini, having a case with good grip for one handed use and holding for long periods during gameplay is almost a must. I am very active so having a case that will allow me to hold the mini with one hand is vital to me. This case absolutely excels at this and then some. I initially thought with the \u201chard to miss\u201d handle on the back of the device would make it hard hold in two hands and play games fearing the handle may be in the way.  This was not the case at all in fact I actually forgot the handle was there as I played my favorite games.  And the grip and texture of the case made it even easier to hold.  Then on top of that when I needed to hold with one hand I was able to slide my hand in the handle and hold forever while I surfed the web.  This case made me a believer, I know feel like I almost have to have the handle there.<br /><br />Next, I like a case to cover as much of the back and sides of the device as possible. This one definitely delivers in this department as well covering almost all outlets with buttons and plugs. The entire back and sides of the phone are covered with the cutouts in the appropriate places. And mostimportantly the power sleep/wake and volume buttons work flawlessly with case installed.  The site claims the case is water resistant, dirt and shockproof, and so far I have found that to be the case in all but the dust proof only because I haven\u2019t tested that, But accidentally dropped on concrete in the rain walking into my gym.  The mini still works like a champ, and the case doesn\u2019t even show any damage just a few scratches.<br /><br />I am not big on style and looks exactly, so a case doesn\u2019t radically need to change the look of my iPad, or be the most attractive to look at for me.  As long as the functionality is there and it\u2019s protected I am happy.  This case isn\u2019t the most attractive I have seen, but it definitely is still easy on the eyes.  Some may really not like the brown handle on the back but I think the whole thing works especially adding the fact that the handle works great and makes for much easier one handed holding.  But guess what, if the brown handle is really bothering you that much you can actually take it off and still have an awesome kickstand case that provides great protection. Speaking of the kickstand it has to be one of the best built I have seen on a case.  Have you ever got an iPad mini kickstand case pulled the kickstand out and tried to use it only to find the case feels like it going to move or tip over during use.  Well you never run in to that problem here the case feels very sturdy while propped on the kickstand.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you need a great highly protective case with awesome functionality look no further this is the one.  Definitely earns a five star rating in my book, only one minor gripe I have is that the  built in screen protection on the case seemed to be a little warped like it wasn\u2019t stretched tight enough across the device.  But I contacted the company and they are aware of this problem and are in the process of fixing it.  Functionality is still very solid though.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great coverage of back and sides for protection, iPad dropped twice once on concrete in the rain, once on gym floor not a scratch on it.... (Deal Breaker)<br />2. Adjustable/removable handle on the back is awesome for holding the device for long periods of time, with no problems<br />3. Kickstand works perfectly and has a rubber tip for sturdy propping<br />4. Power/volume buttons still easy to press with case installed (Deal Breaker)<br />5. Texture of device is awesome allowing for MUCH better grip and overall fit to the device.<br />6. Overall case build and quality is outstanding, worth the price in my opinion, case does not feel cheap at all.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Screen protection could be tighter, the company says they are aware of this problem and are in the process of fixing it.  Functionality is still very solid though.",

You CANNOT charge the tablet while docked. You could of course,  dock the tab upside down and charge using the charger that came with your tablet. But using your front camera would be funy because the camera would point to your tummy because of the angle.<br />2. The keyboard does not utilize the preferences set for your onscreen keyboard. So, auto capitilization on double space etc would not work<br />3. As other reviewers have told, typing could be a challenge due to the size. But what would oe expect from something this small?? I think it only makes sense and there isn't anything to complain about that.<br />4. Not sure why, but keys such as period, left brace, ! Would not work in some places. Like Amazon review box. So i typed this in a memo app and pasted it in Amazon. !@#$%^<br />5. Docking in the portrait mode as shown in the pucture is a joke. IT DOES NOT STAND.<br />6.

I worked almost every day, trying everything I could think of to get it working again.  When I eventually went to its support site, it was almost useless, and left me circling around the site with almost no success.  The one suggestion I did find, which was try a power supply with a higher amp output, failed, so I emailed their tech support.  They esentially told me that they did not really know what to do, but that I should try a different computer and/or USB cable (Which I mentioned in the report trying) and if that failed to get a replacement, and that my only hope to recover the files was with a software the company sold (There was a demo available though) that only worked with software issues, and my problem is obviously a hardware one.  So now my choices are get a replacement and forever lose my files, or try and pry the hard drive open and fix it myself, which would void the warrenty and if I failed I would lose my files and the money that would have to be spent on a new drive.

            "input": "(Re-wrote this review 12/6/09)    This is an excellent budget notebook with a 15.6\\\\\" screen that's only 5.8 lbs.  We just bought two for my wife's parents (don't buy it for 3D games, as it has integrated graphics, but office apps and browsing are fine).    Pros:  - T6600 Core 2 Duo (not the Pentium Dual Core, lower-end C2D, ULVs, or Atoms)  - Relatively quiet and light (5.8 lbs)  - Big hard drive (mine had a Seagate Momentus 5400.6)  - Screen has relatively good viewing angles, horizontal and vertical  - Pretty good fit and finish for a plastic casing (although there's a somewhat flimsy lid that is separate from the battery)  - 4 USB ports  - VGA output is crisp (to 1280x1024, didn't try bigger)  - I haven't noticed the palm rest getting warm at all ... but you're not playing 3D games are you?  - You can select one language during boot up that's set forever, that is, until you restore from the recovery partition.  The first time I chose Traditional Chinese.  Works great.  I restored (press F9 at boot) and selected English.  Works great, didn't need to put in DVDs, and all the software reappeared.  I even choose the option to use one C:\\ drive, instead of the default 60% C:, 40% D:.  - Opening the notebook casing is easy -- find the \\\\\"electronic - hardware\\\\\" version (not the \\\\\"hardware\\\\\" version) of the manual on Asus's web site (search for K50, then click Download, then Manuals).  The hard drive is easily replaceable.  Relatively clean layout so I can imagine blowing out dust bunnies will be easy.  - Includes Office Home & Student 2007 (Word/Excel/PowerPoint/OneNote) pre-installed WITHOUT a product key.  It asks for that so I assume you just punch one in and everything's great.  - Includes a trial of Trend Micro Internet Security for antivirus protection pre-installed.  - Aside from the Asus utilities, relatively little bloatware  - Turned off all of Win7's eye candy.  Don't need that.  - 1-year international warranty.  Includes accident protection (register for this within 60 days on the Asus U.S. web site, and it's non-transferrable from the original owner).  No paperwork on extending the warranty.  We're trying our luck in case the computer breaks down in < 1 year and they give us a hassle about it being a gift and the warranty being valid.    Cons:  - A bit fat  - The screen has a blue tinge, just like with Asus's TN LCD displays.  You get used to it though.  - Glossy screen (reflections), not matte  - Two-finger touchpad scrolling is too sensitive out of the box with Firefox (although it might be okay with IE).  Turning it all the way down, it's fine.  - The numeric keypad uses smaller keys!  Difficult to use for folks with big hands.  - The arrow keys don't have space around them (and actually the right arrow key is bumped into the numeric keypad section), so you need to learn where they are.  - The keyboard and touchpad are on the left side of the computer because of the numeric keypad.  You quickly get used to that, though, so no biggie.  - The touchpad buttons require some pressure to click, but you get used to it.  - 4 GB maximum memory.  Just 1 user-accessible memory slot which contains 2GB.  No biggie.  - No DVI.  No port replicator option with that option.  - No Bluetooth, FireWire, eSATA, ExpressCard/PCI Express slot  - Integrated Intel graphics (not for 3D gaming, but great for 2D apps)  - The T6600 doesn't support Windows 7's XP compatibility mode.  Most of the Win7 Home Premium notebooks I've seen have a CPU which doesn't support XP mode.  Only Win7 Professional and higher supports VT mode anyway.  Does XP mode matter at all?  I have no idea.  Search the Internet for that.  - It doesn't wake up when you open the lid.  It does sleep when you close the lid.  Yes, I checked the settings.  Tip:  Change the close-lid behavior to Sleep instead of Hibernate for a faster sleep, but battery will drain faster.    Edit 12/10/09:    A few cons I've noticed:  - The two speakers are on the bottom of the notebook, at the front lip.  You really need a hard surface to reflect the sound up to you.  Definitely below average compared with other notebooks IMO.  - The Page Up / Down keys are above the numeric keypad -- way out of reach.  It's an incredible hassle with Internet browsing.  - Remember how I wrote the graphics are good enough for 2D?  If you watch a Yahoo! music video in full screen mode, that sucker will tear during fast motion.  It's fine at the normal zoom level and with computers with discrete graphics.  - I'm always accidentally hitting the DVD eject button.  Other notebooks I've used recess this button.",

I knew I would need an enclosure right away simply because I didn't want to keep the older drive in my laptop (since it would rarely be used - my laptop DOES have 2 drive bays, though), and it made a whole lot more sense to save the money on buying the caddy kit for my laptop to just buy this enclosure and make the internal drive an external one. Another benefit of this enclosure was that I was able to easily insert my Samsung SSD into it temporarily as I cloned the HDD to it. Worked flawlessly, and is high enough speed to where it can even keep up with the 500 mbps read/write that my Samsung SSD is capable of.<br /><br />All of that being said, I'd like to just point out the pros and cons of this unit, as you may see a little of both as you read through reviews.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Doesn't hinder speed of any drive w/ fast interface & USB 3.0<br />-Incredibly easy drive installation, cable is concealed even while attached<br />-Comes with a USB extension cable, if needed, to run a longer cord to a desktop or to help keep the drive in a better location<br />-Reliable; Other external enclosures I've had would turn the drive off under load. No issues here.<br />-Works with both my SSD and HDD - The measurements are probably slightly different but this enclosure is able to compensate<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Build quality: some people complain about the 'cheap' feel to it. I rather enjoy the light & minimal feel, however some may think this lacks protection. NO external enclosure is truly meant for protecting the drive from shock - you should not be dropping drives with the hopes that the enclosure will protect them.<br />-The included Short cable may not allow the drive to lie flat if the port you're plugging it into is a stretch. No issue... you can always use the included extension cable.<br /><br />Overall I think this is an excellent enclosure for the price. Extremely portable, no dangling wire to worry about (granted you choose to use only the concealed cable), and works reliably. It's not perfect but it gets a 5-star rating for its value and functionality in my book.verall I think this is an excellent enclosure for the price.

I am sick and tired of these companies stuffing software down your throat that \\\\\"they\\\\\" think you need. Along with nagging upgrades for a price and commercials of things they just know you would want. Imagine buying a car and before it will start you have to listen to a commercial.    I quit buying HP printers and advising my customers not to buy them because a simple driver that should take about 30 seconds to install becomes a 30 minute exercise in answering questions that you don't have the slightest clue about such as, \\\\\"Do you want to share your data with the Professional Viewer in a secure and encrypted manner?\\\\\" No, of course I don't... I want to share it with a goofball hacker that is not secure and I want to read the data that I save.\\\\\"    Anyway, my frustration was maxed out by this. They take what could be a simple and pleasing device and turn it into a pain in the rear end that makes you hate it every time you use it and leaves you guessing each and every time if it will work on a particular computer.    Until a little man jumps out of the package of these harebrained schemes, that are dreamed up by a 12 year old game player, and copies the files that I want when and where I want, I'm going to boycott these fools that try to give you what \\\\\"they\\\\\" think you need instead of what you want.    I only bought this because it doesn't have a cap and the connector is protected while in your pocket. So much for totally screwing up a great idea. Someone should be fired for this numskull idea. This is like protecting toilet paper with a password that comes with a toothbrush.    The key to the behavior of this boondoggle is called \\\\\"U3.\\\\\" Yes, U3. When you see it on any product, avoid it like the plague. Here is the criticisms from Wikipedia:    Freezing the Computer ('strong possibility' if certain software is installed on host computer)  Closed Platform  Uninstallation issues  Leaves Traces on Host PC  Data Security (The drive is supposed to seal itself after a certain number of invalid password entries, requiring a reformat)  Insufficient user privileges  Two Drive Letters  Windows requirement for removal    If your idea of a memory stick is one where a Skype logo comes up when you insert it, this stick is for you.    === The above was my rant. Since then I found SanDisk offers free software to remove not only U3 but the partition where you can make it into a simple big memory stick with one drive. Thanks to someone who replied I ran is software suggestion and it worked flawlessly. My first attempt was either the wrong software or for a different model and it still booted two disks. I am now much more pleased and would give it a 3 star rating. Why no higher? Because SanDisk does not make it clear that you can convert this into a true memory stick but offers software that removes the Launch Pad. It (unless there is more than one program that they offer) actually removes U3 and the partition.    Thanks due to the reviewers on Amazon, I now have a device that I like much better. If I can not change my star rating for this product, I will eventually delete my review so as not to affect the overall rating unfairly.",

This multi-card reader seemed just the thing to do it.  It worked great on my Windows 7 64-bit PC.  It is quite small, only 2.3\\\\\" x 4\\\\\" x 0.8\\\\\".  The box itself is aluminum, so it has a nice solid feel.  The back has 3 connections - CompactFlash (CF), XD, and the micro-USB3.0 connector for plugging into your PC.  The front has MS, TF, M2, and SD.  Unlike some other readers, ports aren't shared, so plugging in a card is easy.  I tested it with both my SD card and CF card, and both were read just fine simultaneously.  The device comes in a nice package, protected by plastic sheets, and includes a 24\\\\\" SuperSpeed USB3.0 cable.<br /><br />So why just 4 stars?  First, it was a little disappointing that there were no feet on the case, so the aluminum can just slide around on your desk.  It's not really portable and not really for your desk - it's somewhere in the middle.  Second, there is a blue indicator light of power, but no indicators of activity.  My previous all-in-one from Sandisk had a global power LED, and then a small LED on each port.  That LED would light up when I plugged in a card, would flash while copying files, and when I ejected it from my system, the light would turn off letting me know I could remove the card.  On this device, there is only the 1 blue power LED, and nothing else.<br /><br />So 4 stars - it works, copies files fast, and is small.  But for 5 stars I want the activity lights and status lights I've come to expect in card readers.<br /><br />Note: I received a free sample of this device from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.",

Pros:  - your iPad 2 will be well guarded against drops and other mishaps with this case on - this is my #1 priority in a case like this and the main driver for my 4 star review  - rubberized outer shell makes the iPad easier to hold and prevents slips  - well designed product, the flaps and other covers fit nicely  - sturdy, the design of the Defenders in general is very good in my opinion  - attractive - well, I guess as attractive as a black case gets - people certainly notice and comment on it, which is a great lead-in for me to start talking techie (which my wife swears I look for any excuse to do)  - the current price on Amazon is well under what I paid originally for this case and actually makes it a darn good value in my opinion  - the provided stand also doubles as a protective device that can either be snapped on the front or back of the iPad  Cons:  - lacks a screen protector - I ended up getting the anti-smudge invisibleSHIELD installed, but wished that this case would have had one built in like the iPhone 4 model  - bulky and heavy - you will notice when you have this case on, not only from the additional weight but from the added girth - security and peace of mind come with a price and its not for everyone  - can't use a lot of speaker systems with this case on unless it has a raised 32-pin connector, like several Philips Fidelio models do  - the stand is terrible - only two positions, both in landscape and is plastic with little rubber feet - I bought an Arkon Portable stand and basically leave the provided stand on a shelf  - is not the right case for all activities - specifically when I travel on business, I need a keyboard, so I will take it out of this case and slip it into a keyboard/case - I'm starting to have concerns about how many times I can do this before something breaks as I don't get the feeling this was designed for the case to be pulled apart on a regular basis - however, that said, I've done it over 10 times now and it still is OK  - won't protect against a drop where the large screen opening strikes an object - but then again, no other case would either  - I have an invisibleSHIELD from Zagg installed on my iPad 2 and it marked up the shield a fair amount from where the case puts pressure on the iPad - that's why I have the screenshield in the first place though, and would recommend others to have one too with this product  Recommendations:  - build in a screen protector  - redesign the stand or just get rid of it - better yet, send everyone an Arkon Portable with it and make them happy  - potentially look to re-engineer the case to make it easier to get on/off as this case is not right for all activities - people need flexibility with their cases to change them as situations change - help enable them to do that by designing it into the product  Overall, I am happy with this case as it does what I want it to do very well -- protect my iPad.  This is the only case I've had for the iPad where I felt comfortable giving it to my young children and not having to worry if I was going to get it back in one piece.  If you have young kids, I highly recommend this -- or if you haul your iPad around a lot and don't need a keyboard, consider this before buying another case.",

I have already read that this SSD can get really hot, so I already got myself a small ball baring fan that I was able to screw on the heat sink. When installing the Windows Disk at boot, I followed the instructions to the T for this drive and when/how to instal the driver, it's very specific to do it correctly when you intend to use it for a Boot drive. So here is the thing... I have the MSI BIG Bang-Xpower (MS-7666) X58 mother board and I could not find a single thread online that stated this PCIe card would work on this motherboard in boot-up setup, even OCZ's \\\\\"compatible\\\\\" motherboard list doesn't include this board. So I looked and saw on MSI's website that they released a bios update on 1 7 2011 that specifically states it now supports the OCZ PCIe cards. So, here I am with a working card on this older mother board. It's a great board and I was not ready to upgrade. I also have the i7 990X processor, so I have a nice set up. Anyhow, a previous article states it's really a 700mb/sec card, which is still impressive. I did the test he did and I am achieving 900mb/sec. I'm a happy camper. I do suggest you use gloves when handling this drive, there is no cover or casing around it at all, and I highly recommend getting a very good small fan for the heat sink. I got this card as I do a lot of Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects as well at Photo editing with Adobe products, this just helps me achieve a more effective workflow.<br /><br />Some tips I learned. Be sure to set up your bios to run the drives as AHCI before you even start with the Windows Instal Disk, turn off \\\\\"Defragment your hard drive\\\\\", I guess this is for Windows 7.

NFS Shift, which previously really stressed out my GPU runs perfect maxed out (I forget the settings, but probably everything maxed out, no AA).  Unigine's benchmark on all default settings (at 1920x1080 again) ran very well.  I do wish it were a bit smoother, but it averaged around 30FPS which is fine by me.    The card itself is a good size, not requiring a massive amount of space previous generation cards with similar specs.  Heat management is wonderful too, with the card running much cooler than other cards I've tested both at idle and maxed out.    Oh yes, and you'll get a nice little \\\\\"upgrade\\\\\" if you purchase one of these cards.  A bios is being offered (mine came pre-lodaed with it) that bumps the stock clock up from 675/1350 to 720/1440.  But of course if this isn't enough, these cards overclock like crazy.

This firmware version apparently has a serious bug.<br /><br />2.  TWC will NOT push firmware updates to consumer owned modems.  So, if you bought a Black SB6141 you're on your own and Good Luck.<br /><br />OK...so here is my story.<br /><br />1.  I bought the Black version of this modem on November 24, 2012 from Amazon.  I won't bet my first born female child on it, but I don't recall a White version being available at that time.<br /><br />2.  My Black version of the modem DID come in a Brown Motorola box.  The label on the outside of the box says, &#34;NEW.&#34;  (Even though it is over a year later, I still have the box and all the receipts and packaging.)<br /><br />3.  I am a TWC customer in Durham, NC<br /><br />4.  I went to http://192.168.100.1 to access information about my modem.  (BTW, when the home page opens on this site you need to tap on &#34;Help&#34; to get info about your Modem such as the firmware version.<br /><br />5.  This is the data for my Black Motorola SURFboard SB6141 as of 1/18/2013 as revealed by the site above.<br /><br />Model Name: SB6141<br />Vendor Name: Motorola<br />Firmware Name: SB_KOMODO-1.0.6.12-SCM00-NOSH<br />Boot Version: PSPU-Boot(25CLK) 1.0.12.18m3<br />Hardware Version: 7.0<br /><br />As mentioned above, many have said that the Black version I have was shipped with Firmware version 1.0.6.3.  Perhaps that is true.  I did NOT check the firmware version when I bought the modem.  Many of those same people have also said that TWC does NOT push firmware updates to consumer owned modems.  That may be true.  BUT, logically speaking, both of these statements can't be true.<br /><br />Right!<br /><br />I suspect that TWC did push an update to my modem.  I don't know if this is done everywhere by TWC, but in Durham, NC it looks like they do.<br /><br />If anyone wants to check the firmware version on their Black SB6141, I think others might be interested to know what firmware version your unit is running.<br /><br />Cheers,  Mr. Luigi",

Not in his technology or physical shape (I had seen a lot of video and stuff before buying it) but in it's usefullness.    I have bought it hoping to being able to study (math) on it, and for that it's quite awfull: you NEED tridimensional memory to study (you know, when you remember \\\\\"yes, that was more or less here in the book\\\\\"), you need to look at multiple pages togheter, you need to keep \\\\\"finger bookmark\\\\\" in the whole book, and those are MUCH quicker then actual ones. Moreover PDF support, even with the new firmware, isn't that great.    On the other side, to read is wonderful. I am a book-crawler, I read a lot but I was almost sure that to read on such a thing wouldn't be the same as reading on paper. Moreover there were the language barrier: I'm not from an anglofone country and in my native language there aren't many e-book available. I had tried to read english novels some times with poor results (as such as enjoying them...).     I was wrong again. To read on Kindle is very pleasant and after a couple of hours you don't even realize if you are reading ink or e-ink. And being able to bring around many books (I read a couple of books per week) with little weight has really saved my life on ryanair flight with strict weight-policy. Even the language barrier isn't a problem at all, thanks to the automatic vocabulary.    In the end if you want to buy it to read math or articles, I wouldn't suggest it. But to read, expecially during travels, it's wonderful.

The differences are as follows By Ladan Khamsepoor // Sr. Product Marketing Manager, Video Business:<br /><br />There are a few subtle changes:<br />- While the QuickCam Pro 9000 offers VGA-quality video at 30 frames per second (high-quality video) on Skype, we made adjustments to ensure the updated Webcam Pro 9000 can perform up to VGA-quality video at 30 FPS on any video application, including Logitech Vid.<br />- The Webcam Pro 9000 was modified to be capable of adjusting to widescreen format and record 720 pixels (1280\u00d7720) at up to 30 FPS.<br />- Finally, software is no longer required for RightLight. Instead, we\\'ve built it into the device, so right out of the box, you\\'ll get the best image quality possible, regardless of harsh or dim lighting conditions. Perhaps too much information, but we also adjusted the firmware to make sure that RightLight engages only when necessary.<br /><br />[...]<br />---end excerpt<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I got a frustration free package and compared with a Quickcam version I got a little earlier.<br /><br />Yes the frustration free package one got recognized by windows 7 as \\\\\"Webcam Pro 9000\\\\\" while the earlier version is recognized as \\\\\"Quickcam Pro 9000\\\\\". The drivers and softwares specified by Logitech's website appears to be universal and Both cam had a \\\\\"driver information\\\\\" showing driver version of 12.10.1110.0. The firmware version reads 5.0.1161 on the Webcam 9000 and 2.96.6009 on the Quickcam, suggesting possible different firmware families than increments of the same firmware. It also may suggest that there are differences in hardware as well.<br /><br />Testing it in video mode--the quickcam version's flaw wasn't apparent at first, until one investigated closer. The HD video frame on the Webcam version is a little cropped, suggesting it used fewer pixels than the full frame sensor, or only 1280x720 out of the 1600x1200. You can see this when you switch to the 1600x1200 mode. That did not happen with the Quickcam pro 9000. At first I thought the Quickcam gave me a scaled down interpolation of the full resolution video, showing its full wide angle picture, which would have been advantageous over a cropped image on the Webcam version; but then I realized that it is really a scaled up interpolation from 800x450--in other words, full hardware HD video is simply not possible with Quickcam Pro 9000, while it is available on the newer Webcam version.<br /><br />Despite the less-than-ideal method of using reduced sensor area that produced a cropped image (thereby negating the wide angle lens advantage at full HD setting), I speculate that the Webcam version did this to reduce CPU load for interpolation. Still, I wish a full frame scaled down 720p HD mode is available as an option.<br /><br />What is more incredible is when I tried to record video. For some reason, the webcam version was able to record smooth HD video at full 1280x720, while the older quickcam version, despite the scale-up interpolation, had a lot of trouble with that resolution setting, or even at 800x450. I use a x61s thinkpad -- hardly speedy by today's standards. However, it goes to show something is done quite differently with the new webcam version, as the results are not even close -- I recorded non-HD videos that looked like still pictures jumping from frame to frame with in-tact audio using the Quickcam version, while the Webcam version was able to record fluid 720p HD videos without problems. Webcam version wins by an unbelievable margin here.<br /><br />Then the photo test: i imagined both camera will show full resolution in photo mode, or 1600x1200. NOT SO! At 1600x1200, which is supposed to be native resolution for both of these cams, the Quickcam version showed a blurry picture that clearly seems interpolated, or a scaled up version of 800x600. The details are just absent, and looked identical to a 800x600 image. The Webcam was evidently at 2MP with details that cannot be there with interpolation. Why can't the Quickcam version take photos at its native resolution is beyond me.<br /><br />The above tests made me wonder about these possibilities: 1. the newer driver simply doesn't support Quickcam pro 9000 version fully, and catered to Webcam version instead; 2.Quickcam Pro 9000 had always been a half baked product with these flaws, hence the upgrade; 3.something is wrong with the driver and/or the hardware as tested. If it's either #1 or #2, I find it incredible that Logitech was able to charge close to $100 for the Quickcam Pro 9000 version that doesn't deliver on its HD promises, and performed in reality only slightly better than my old Quickcam fusion.<br /><br />Testing the cams side by side in real use such as skype and msn, the image quality didn't look all that different -- a little soft than my liking especially for a cam of this price range. AF performance is also similar. There is very little difference that I can discern, other than the ones mentioned above, which is not subtle by any measure.<br /><br />For what it's worth: the webcam9000 that came in the frustration package is a little scuffed up compared to the Quickcam version I got in a retail package. The plastic on the camera is of a polished/mirror finish, so any hairline scratch/scuff/buffs show up instantly. There was none on the Quickcam Retail, but some on the Frustration Free Packed version wrapped in plastic bag. However I am not sure if it's really related to the packaging or production batches. I am anal retentive in that regard, but for most people it probably doesn't matter. The difference in the amount of plastic and packing material is mind boggling though. For the sake of the environment and savings, frustration free package is a real innovation.<br /><br />With regards to \\\\\"built in\\\\\" right light -- that sounds a bit odd (i.e. it scarcely makes sense), as right light is built into logitech's driver ANYWAY and is always software activated/controlled. On both cams I was offered the option of turning it on or leaving it on always. I believe from the inception, right light was hardware dependent (earlier Quickcams simply couldn't support it), suggesting there were hardware involvement in the cameras anyway. The fact that you don't need driver support to run it doesn't make much sense--the webcam doesn't run without its driver.<br /><br />Which is better? Webcam Pro 9000. The advantage over the older Quickcam version is significant--unless it's due to software/driver screw-up, which is a real possibility.<br /><br />I am open to corrections and would love to learn what others find.uickcam version showed a blurry picture that clearly seems interpolated, or a scaled up version of 800x600.

The single click works well, as does the single tap and double finger tap for the right click.  The keyboard is quite heavy [it takes 4 AA batteries], and is not backlit (not an issue for the office, once again might be an issue for HTPC use hence the TK830 is better for that), but feels very solid - another reason it is suited to the office rather than for HTPC use [imho].  It also works well with the unified usb dongle if you have more than one Logitch gadget - on that note, the usb dongle worked right out of the box, found the keyboard immediately and installed a small piece of software that allowed me to calibrate the trackpad.  The keys are nicely spaced and have a satisfying feel to them.  There is a handy on/off switch for power saving overnight.<br /><br />I use the keyboard/trackpad [TK820] at work for my Dell W8.1 laptop which is connected to a 22 inch monitor as a screen extension - I have not noticed [like previous reviwers] any key click delays nor have I experienced any distance issues [I have taken the keyboard into a conference room and plugged it in and used it from about a 10-15 foot distance; without delays or a break in communication].<br /><br />Bottom line - exactly fit for purpose [small office/home office], but not suited as a HTPC combo due to its weight and size - if you need a combo for HTPC, then the TK830 is the goto gadget.",

The Size.  At only 7' inches, the Fire is compact but not much different from the old Kindle.  The unit is a little heavier than the old Kindle but not much difference there either.<br /><br />2.  The Screen.  The touch screen is easy to navigate even if you have not used a smart phone or an iPod touch.  The screen could use a little improvement and I will note that below.<br /><br />3.  The Light.  The screen is well-lit.  In a dark room, I needed to turn the light down as it is bright.  For watching videos or playing games though, it is perfect.<br /><br />4.  The Apps.  Much like the iPod, the apps are easy to find and easy to control.  While Amazon doesn't have a lot of apps yet, I am sure more are on the way.  The apps appear along with your books on the front page in a scrolling menu.<br /><br />5.  Books.  Amazon, of course, allows you to store your books in the Amazon cloud that allows you to essentially read as much as you want to and store off of your Kindle.  The genus of this is that you can download as many books as you want to and it doesn't affect your memory on the Fire.  I have plenty of room on my Fire for both apps and books.<br /><br />6.  Navigation.  The Fire is easy to navigate.  Again, if you have used a smart phone or an iPod touch then you would have no problems with the Fire.<br /><br />7.  The Color.  The colors on the Fire are excellent and compare to the iPad.<br /><br />8.  Internet.  The internet works well on the Fire though not fast.  It is efficient.<br /><br />9.  The Price.  The bottom line is that the price of the Fire is worth it.  I paid $200 for mine and after using it now for a good day, I would say that is a fair price for this unit.<br /><br />The Negatives<br /><br />1.  The Screen.  Some other reviewers have noted the glare on the screen.  I noticed this as soon as I opened my Fire and turned it on.  It is a weakness.  The other negative of the screen is that the touch is very sensitive.  If you so much brush the screen with your clothing or hand, you'll turn the page while reading or go out of an app.  This is annoying.<br /><br />2.  Sharing What You've Read via Twitter or Facebook.  I use to share what I was reading from my old Kindle on Facebook and Twitter regularly.  The Fire is not as easy to share with and takes some work to do so.  I have yet to share with the Fire.  It's that tough.<br /><br />3.  Internet.  I noted above that this was a positive but the only drawback of the Internet on the Fire is the speed.  The iPad is much faster than the Fire in terms of the Internet.  However, I don't plan on doing much on the Internet with the Fire so I will not let this worry me.<br /><br />4.  Highlighting.  On the old Kindle it was easy to highlight what you were reading.  The Fire is not as easy.  The touch screen is too sensitive and this makes highlighting tough though not impossible.  Notes are difficult as well.<br /><br />5.  Typing.  The small screen makes it tough to type with.  Unlike the iPad, the Fire was not built to be typed on but the drawback of this is that games that require typing (such as Words With Friends) is not easy.  I keep misspelling the simplest words because of the difficulty in typing.<br /><br />6.  Sound.  Much of the pictures I saw of the Fire before it was released showed people listening to the Fire via headphones.  Now I see why.  The sound is so low.  I tried to watch a video on the Fire and even with the volume turned wide open, it was difficult to hear.  You'll need headphones if you plan on watching videos with the Fire.<br /><br />7.  Battery Life.  The old Kindle had a battery life that would last days with high usage.  The Fire does not.  The battery life has gone down greatly with limited usage.  However, the old Kindle obviously didn't have the amount of things thatit was doing as the Fire does so I will let this one slide.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Would I recommend buying the Fire?  Yes I would.  It is comfortable, easy to use, and while it is not a perfect unit, it is very reliable and useful.  I love to read and have found the Kindle and now the Fire to be almost required for good reading in our wireless generation.  The price is good and with Amazon cloud, you can read as many books as you can possibly purchase (both for money and for free at Amazon) and know that it will not take up room on your Fire.

Its actual capacity is 61,568mWh vs the designed 76,960mWh...very disappointing.<br /><br />This could be a fluke, maybe I received a battery that sat on the shelf a little too long, who knows. I'll update my review after I experience Talented & Gifted's (the vendor who sold this through Amazon) RMA process. Hopefully the replacement battery will be fine.<br /><br />-Mike<br /><br />UPDATE 4/1/2014<br /><br />I received the replacement battery and have determined that the first was not a fluke, battery #2 came with a wear level of 19.7%! To put this in prospective, my original HP battery only has a wear level of 11%...and that's after 7 years of my abuse (leaving it plugged in extended periods, draining it completely dead - contrary to popular belief that is very bad for Lithium Ion batteries) I have downgraded my rating of this product to 1 star for reasons of poor quality control.<br /><br />To the vendor's credit (Talented & Gifted), the RMA process went smoothly, they were very fast to respond to emails (sent via Amazon) and shipping a replacement. I had to ship them the original at my expense (not unusual) and provide them with tracking info but I will be annoyed if I have to ship this second defective battery again at my expense, especially since the product listing states these batteries are tested when obviously they are all not (could possibly be construed as misleading).<br /><br />My conclusion is don't waste your time or money on these particular batteries and look for one with better reviews for quality, that's what I plan to do.

I found a three pack of 34mm to 54mm stabilizer \\\\\"wings\\\\\" for about $3 locally.  I received the card and attached the 54mm stabilizer.  The card seems to stick out about 3 to 5mm more than needed from the laptop's ExpressCard port, but maybe other laptops need more clearance.    Once inserted the card was instantly recognized in Windows 7 x64 and drivers automatically loaded.  I never touched the disc that came with the card, but never do for any PC hardware.  Just get the latest drivers from the manufacture's website or in this case let Windows 7 handle it automatically.    The card connected as a 1Gbps connection to my Gigabit network (Trendnet 16-port switch).  In the adapter properties it shows Jumbo Frame support up to 9K MTU in 1K increments.  I did a file copy of a ~8GB file and the 5,400 rpm laptop HDD maintained about 65 MB/s which is what I was expecting since the HDD transfer speed is the bottleneck.  I also ejected the card and reinserted it a couple times, without rebooting, and it reconnected with no problems.    So far everything works great and it performs better than expected.  I was concerned that the ExpressCard port speed would be a bottleneck, but that wasn't the case with my (wife's) laptop.  If I had to find a negative it would be that the card could be about 5mm shorter so that the bulging part of the card would be flush with the side of the laptop.  In my case there is a gap between the side and where the bulge begins.  However, I assume the distance needed varies depending on the laptop so I'm not going to knock it down a star.",

First, I've read many comments here in the review section about the size, weight and propensity for using plastic to judge this case. Look- this is the internet, all you have to do is google the thing and a million images and video's are available to look at to help you research it. Linus tech tips has a really good overview of this thing on YouTube, so if you're on the fence about this case, watch it. Yes it's big. Yes it's heavy. Both are pro's in my book, because I wanted something sturdy and roomy to work in. The plastic on the front and top don't bother me, because I knew it was like that going in, and I didn't feel like it was a deal breaker. If this case were 100 percent metal, it would cost and weigh more, so I understand the compromises. No, you're not going to be lugging this thing to and from LAN parties, but that's not what it was designed for. The 810 is unique among most PC cases in that it doesn't have the bland, blend into the background home/office look or the obnoxious in your face &#34;gamer&#34; case style. It's a well tailored Armani in a world of Old Navy hoodies and Nike sneakers. It looks and feels like a high-end home appliance, and as such is worthy of it's premium asking price. This case definitely has &#34;presence&#34; and draws compliments from everyone who sees it, PC enthusiast or not. The pros far out weigh the cons with the 810. Versatility, modularity and cable management are top notch. And the little touches like ample grommets for cable routing, easy to remove dust filters and led lighting on the I/O shield put it over the top. Worth every cent, imo.",

            "input": "I ordered this USB drive to replace an old Kingston jump drive which I've had for at least 4 years.  The plastic loop on the end of my old one broke recently when I made the dumb move of trying to pull my keychain out of my pocket by the jump drive.  I'm kind of glad it broke though, because it added a fair amount of bulk to my keychain, and this new one is so small that I hardly notice it's even on my key chain.  I'm in love with the form factor of this thing.  It's incredibly small and slender, which is perfect considering that I carry it around in my pocket all day long.  I uploaded some pictures comparing it to my old Kingston and a ball-point pen, so you can get a sense of just how small it is.  Before buying it, I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon (for this one and other 108 models), and most of the criticisms I've seen have been non-issues for me.  I don't care that I have to actually pay attention to the direction it's facing when I insert it into a computer's USB port.  I've actually found that it goes into the port a lot easier than standard flash drives that have metal housing around the connector, since I don't have to keep flipping it upside down and jamming it into the port until it goes in.  It doesn't bother me that there's no LED indicating when it's transferring data -- one of those would have only made it bigger.  As long as you don't yank it out while it's transferring data, and make sure to eject the drive before physically removing it, there's no reason why not having an LED should really matter.  Also, I didn't have any trouble getting it open, like some people complained about.  Just put your fingernail in the indentation on the tip of the plastic part (under the lid), and you'll be good.  I do have two criticisms, though -- one small and one that's potentially significant.  The smaller of the two is that the flash drive is inconvenient to plug into a laptop's USB port, because when the cover is fully open, the loop on the end of it (and therefore my key ring, too) is on the very bottom of the unit, and therefore the key ring has to fit between the flash drive and my desk.  Unless you have an especially thick laptop, or an especially small key ring, this will be slightly inconvenient.  But it's not too hard to work around.  The (potentially) bigger issue is that I'm not sure how long the spring mechanism that keeps the cover shut will last.  Another user's review said that theirs stopped closing securely after they dropped their keys.  I've had mine for a couple weeks, and it hasn't showed any indication that it'll do the same, but at the same time I'm being careful not to open it unless I really need to (which isn't too often -- maybe 3-5 times per week), and I'm careful not to drop my keys.  Even in a closed position, it does have a slight amount of give to it, so it seems plausible that the mechanism keeping it closed will wear out if I abuse it.  But only time will tell whether or not this will become an issue for me, and if so, how long from now that will be.    For $7 though, I really can't complain.  Back when I bought the flash drive this one is replacing, I think it was $20 for 1GB.  If you buy any flash drive from a retail store, you're looking at a minimum of more than twice the price of this unit.  Given the fact that this one's tiny size makes it perfect for carrying on my key chain, I would've gladly paid more for it.  If the spring mechanism does become an issue in the future, I'll be sure to update this review to let people know.",

On large files, however, the drive would regularly \\\\\"hang\\\\\" but then would restart.  All in all, a handy device, and easily portable.",

Also, the coffee and beer that I spilled into my old one didn't help either.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I cleaned it.  I removed the keys and vacuumed out each switch and then blew canned air on it for good measure.  It was a long, tedius job.  That helped some - it stopped the goop from holding my keys down.  However, I believe that some, uh, &#34;organic material&#34; found its way into the switch silding mechanisms, and those are inaccessable.<br /><br />I also dropped it twice.  It still worked.

I quickly discovered that the BlackBerry chargers which I previously used for my prior mobile device was taking much too long to charge the HTC One Mini because those chargers -- also micro USB plug-in adapters-- only deliver a 0.5 amp 2.5 watt output while my factory HTC charger delivered a 1.0 amp 5.0 watt combo. In other words, the plug-in USB chargers on which I had previously relied would not deliver the charging output that i now desired.<br /><br />Since there are also iPhone 4 and iPad 4 as well as Nexus 7 1st Gen devices in my household, I began a search for an external battery that could support Apple, Android, and Google Nexus 7 devices. The iPhone operates optimally when using a 1.0 amp 5.0 watt charger -- identical to the HTC One Mini's needs, the iPad juices up best when using a 2.1 amp 10.0 watt charger, and the Nexus 7 was packaged with a 2.0 amp and 10.0 watt charger.<br /><br />To add further confusion, these four devices use three different USB device adapters. HTC & Nexus - micro USB; iPhone 4 - 16-pin adapter; iPad 4 - 8-pin adapter.<br /><br />I tried two other external batteries strictly for the HTC One Mini before proclaiming the Power Gem as my preferred external back-up power source since the Power Gem can provide battery backup for all four of the aforementioned devices.  Although I imagine that the other batteries could adapt in a pinch to provide external battery support to the Nexus, iPad, and iPhone, the Power Gem can almost completely charge the HTC One Mini whereas the others could provide less than half the charge to the HTC One Mini in the same charging period.<br /><br />The Power Gem charges using a micro USB cord plug-in charger and provides two USB ports for use when acting as an external battery to charge a device. The first port is intended for devices which require &#62; 0.5 amp 2.5 watt charge (the amperage and wattage that a standard computer USB port provides) like an iPad, iPhone, Nexus 7, or HTC One Mini. The second port is best for devices requiring the charge that a computer USB port provides like the various bluetooth ear pieces that I use and perhaps the BlackBerry which my HTC One Mini replaced.<br /><br />With the Power Gem, a USB wall-plug adapter which can charge the Power Gem, the Power Gem's micro USB adapter cord, a USB to 16-pin adapter cord, and a USB to 8-pin adapter cord I am able to accomplish exactly what I had hoped when I began my search for a reliable external battery backup.",

The original battery was an Acer AS10D41 and theirs was a AS10D31 that was a pretty good knock off of the original but there was a lighter blue recycle tag on it that was visibly larger than the original so if you get a bad one and you probably will you can forget about the warranty.

Games I've played on this monitor: Rift, Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2, All the Assassin's Creed games and various other games.   It's pretty much plug and play. I don't remember installing drivers for this monitor. Usually you just need to keep your graphic card drivers up to date.

I spent hours of research time looking at reviews and product and also purchased 3 other headsets including, Turtle Beach, Logitech, and Sentry. They all pale in comparison to this headset. I finally found exactly what I was looking for. A headset that has 'presence\\\\\" when listening to music. Great bass, and great clarity throughout the frequency range including crisp highs. Enough volume to feel bass drum kicks which is the way I like my music.     Pros for this product include comfortable padding on both headband and earpieces. The unit is lightweight so extended wear is not an issue. The volume buttons on the left earpiece are awesome, easy to locate and in my opinion much better than the inline which you need to clip to yourself, limiting mobility or leave hanging causing you to fumble looking for them. The fact that the headset volume syncs with the system volume is a big plus so you are not playing with 2 different master volume levels and causing distortion. With my laptops sound-card I can then control specific volumes with the mixer while leaving the headset full volume. Totally plug and play, no software. Windows 7 saw and identified the unit as a Plantronics 655. Using the EQ in Media player provides an awesome musical sound and the headset can produce tone quality throughout the 20/20 frequency range.    There are two cons of a small nature which by no means to me are a deal breaker: The chipset and all of the technology is in the USB plug causing it to be extra wide. In my case, I have a USB hub where this is not an issue but if you have a limited number of USB ports and they are very close together, this plug may interfere with the neighboring plug. The other con is that although the headset reduces outside noise well, the outside can hear the headset very well. I was told at full blast(which is the way I listen quite often) the music could beheard on the first floor of my home while I'm on the second.    All-in-All an awesome headset. If you are looking for a price range of $35 to $50 you WILL NOT find anything better than these. Take it from someone who really did his research and returned plenty of poor quality headsets.

Easy to slide in and out and the stand for multiple viewing angles are added benefit. Not to mention the fact that it keeps the table in place which means it keeps it aligned with the camera holes. When closed it's discreet and it looks like a book which I love.    The way to use the viewing angles may be complicated but after a few minutes they make sense.    It is not thick but perfect for handling. It just feels right in the hand.    Overall this is a damn good case.

The main reasons for the upgrade were the larger 17.3 inch diagonal screen (vs. the 15.6 inch screen of the G51J-A1), the newly available NVidia GTX460M (vs. the GTX260M of the G51J-A1), Intel Core i7 740QM processor (vs the Core i7 720QM of the G51J-A1), the availability of 4 memory dimm slots (vs. the two DIMMs of the G51J-A1), and lastly the new cooler redesign that uses two dedicated fans; one for the CPU and one for the GPU (vs. the single fan design of the G51J-A1).  These were all valid reasons for the upgrade in my opinion.  I am happy to report that this laptop outperforms the G51J-A1 in every category except for space savings ;)<br /><br />But, as with all reviews there are some drawbacks that come with the improvements that the G73JW laptop provides:<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />- Great performance for the money (similiar equipped Alienware will run $500 more...)<br />- Superior cooling design allows laptop to run quietly even when gaming!<br />- Excellent LED display - great for watching HD videos and Blu Ray movies<br />- Blu Ray optic drive is now a standard option - finally!<br />- Excellent sound from built-in speakers and subwoofer; way better than my G51J-A1's sound capability<br />- Support for EAX 5.0 finally!  My G51J-A1 only has EAX 4.0 support<br />- USB 3.0 port; albeit only one :(<br />- Battery life is surprisingly good for the performance power this laptop provides (about 2 hours from an 8-cell lithium ion battery is pretty good)<br />- White LED Backlit keyboard w/variable brightness (still not an available option on most laptops - only Dell, Alienware, and Asus provide this so far...)<br />- Light weight for its size - most 17 inch laptops weigh easily over 10lbs - this one weighs in at 8lbs! WOW<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Stock WiFi card has just two antenna connections - good for only 2.4Ghz 802.11N<br />- Internal WiFi does not provide a third antenna for true 5Ghz 802.11N WiFi - you will need to buy the extra WiFi antenna off the internet and install it yourself<br />- No PCMCIA expansion slot - G51J-A1 has one!  Weird for Asus to omit this feature?<br />- No eSATA port - would have preferred both an eSATA port AND a USB 3.0 port<br />- 4th DIMM slot is hidden on the other side of the motherboard; allowing the ability to upgrade only three of the memory DIMMs (unless you want to take apart the whole laptop just to upgrade!)<br />- A bit disappointed that Asus didn't offer an option to buy this laptop with either a GTX470M or GTX480M graphics card - maybe they will offer it in the future? (fingers crossed)<br /><br />One final note I wanted to make.  I have read several hardware reviews on this laptop and all of them make the statement that the G73JH variant that is equipped with the ATI 5870 mobile graphics card performs better than the GTX460M.  That is true - for the moment.  Remember, the ATI 5870 mobile card has been out for about 6 months.  The drivers are very mature vs. the GTX460M drivers are still in beta.  Once the drivers are perfected, the GTX460M will blitz past the 5870 with ease - especially with any game or application that uses CUDA, Physx, hardware tesselation, and of course 3D Vision which by the way is a feature ATI does not have.  And, surprisingly the GTX460M runs a full 20 degees Celsius cooler than the 5870 when under full processing mode! O_o  NUFF SAID!<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an excellent laptop and I am very happy with my purchase.  I have only a few minor gripes to report and none of them are \\\\\"show stoppers\\\\\".

Some are dell boxes, some supermicro, some custom.  All worked flawlessly.<br /><br />This KVM does NOT come with cables, you will need to purchase them separately.  I purchased 16x of the 6' foot cables (TK-CU06) also on Amazon at the same time.  They come in 6', 10' and 15'.  The mouse and keyboard part of each port are carried on one USB plug that piggybacks on the VGA cable. The power cable is an AC adapter, it would be nice if it was a straight power cable with the unit having an internal power supply, but that's not a huge deal.<br /><br />What I did was I bought male to female VGA extension cables for each server that was more than 6' away from the switch and it worked perfectly.  This was cheaper than buying the longer KVM cables.  The standard VGA extension cables carried the USB signals just fine so I was able to plug them directly into the switch, and then plug in the 6' VGA/USB KVM cables at the server end, which also helped keep things very clean.  (if I used the KVM cables direct into the switch, I would also need USB extension cables)<br /><br />I really like how this KVM has a separate button for all 16 ports and a red LED for something being live/connected.  So far I consider it to be MUCH better than the Belkin PS2 unit that it replaced.  To be fair though, the Belkin is 7+ years old.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, setup and function of this switch.  I highly recommend it, granted one plans ahead of time with the proper purchase and install of cables.",

The problem was with Time Warner and my cable modem, which would not reset my IP address no matter how many times I tried re-starting the modem. Time Warner's tech support resolved the issue, which was not an issue with the computer at all. The laptop itself is excellent and is meeting all of my needs with no further problems. I'd probably give it 5 stars had it not been for my initial experience with the touchpad and having to re-install Windows. I suspect mine was just a very rare case so don't let this scare you, it was not a big deal at all...put in CD and keep clicking \\\\\"Next\\\\\"! I have no regrets with this purchase and would definitely purchase it again, as well as recommend it to others at the price I purchased it for, which has apparently increased by $160 since I bought it.  ** End 3/31/2011 Update **      I'm rating this product at 3 stars for now (2.5 officially), as the ethernet port appears to be dead upon arrival. Neither of the two cables I have plugged directly into my cable modem work (both work with my desktop). I also had trouble with the touch pad becoming unresponsive. After speaking with a samsung tech and reinstalling the Marvell Yukon 88E8059 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller, it was still a no-go. I was advised to do a complete restore. While this solved the touch pad issue, I still have no internet connectivity via the ethernet port, even after updating with the most recent Marvell driver. Wireless is unknown at this time since I'm waiting on a linksys router to arrive.     So far it's been over 5 hours of frustration trying to get this thing working properly. The only positive I can speak of at this point is that the gentlemen from Samsung's technical support answered quickly, spoke fluent English, and his name was not Peggy. I will update my review as the situation unfolds, but seeing as I have purchased this laptopfor school work and have a new term starting on Monday, I'm not thrilled by my experience thus far.",

The only real differences that I have noticed between this model and the more expensive model is the lack of a blu-ray drive and that there is no keyboard back-lighting. If these are important to you, then you should definitely get the most expensive model ($1099).    I purchased this laptop about a week ago, through tiger direct, for college use after my ASUS had failed (major hardware issues). So far, I am very impressed. There are better lengthy reviews on this model already (see Mad B's for example), so I shall keep this brief.     Pros:   - Gaming: I am not an avid gamer, but it was important to me that my new rig could handle any new games that I would want to throw at it. To be clear, games on this machine run beautifully. The 230M is a true performer, and I had no problem playing Team Fortress 2 and  Left 4 Dead 2 (demo) on this machine at max settings. I am confident that you would be able to play more demanding games with no problems.    - Windows 7 : Loving it so far. I have had zero compatibility problems with my favorite programs, and if you are buying a new laptop, you may as well get one with the latest OS.    - Full Keyboard : Just a nice feature to have, really.   - Speakers : Great for just listening to music or watching a movie. These speakers are plenty loud and aren't tinny like most laptop speakers.  (NOTE: There have been some reported problems with these speakers just not working suddenly. Before you assume it is a driver issue, turn off the laptop, take out the battery, and reinsert. This inexplicably seems to fix the problem. This has only happened to me once, but is a common issue with the A505 series.)       Cons:   - Battery Life : About 2 to 2.5 hours on a low power setting. If you are gaming, forget it. It is important to know this going in. If you don't like to have your laptop plugged into the wall most of the time, then you will want to look into some other options.If you are like me, and this is more of a desktop replacement, then no issue.    - Finger Prints! : Don't get me wrong, this laptop is very attractive...just pre-use. I am constantly wiping this thing down with a micro-fiber cloth after use, to keep it shiny. Not really that big of a deal though.    Overall, I'd give this a 9/10. If you can forgive the battery life and deal with the finger prints, you can enjoy a laptop that can handle itself pretty darn well.",

This was available for quick Prime delivery, so I snapped it up.  It does the job of protecting, but I honestly don't like the case.  It's just plain clunky, and the entire time I used it, I longed for my device to be naked.  The various hooked ends that hold the device in this case are uneven, and aesthetically displeasing.  Opening the case is harder than it should be, because of the hook mechanism employed (my small children need my help to open the case).  Putting the case into stand mode is odd and slightly frustrating.  The case is thick, which adds protection, but also reduces the lightweight feel of the device, and makes this svelte device feel clunky.<br /><br />I used this for about a month before searching for another.  I ended up buying the [[ASIN:B00E5NOXM4 Poetic Slimline Case for Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen 2013 Android Tablet Black (With Auto Wake / Sleep Function) (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)]].  I love it.  It feels good in every way the i-Blason case feels clunky.  Magnetic closure alone is far superior to the hook approach.  The Poetic case goes into stand mode much easier, without partially removing your device like the i-Blason.  The Poetic case feels good in the hand, in contrast to the i-Blason's bulky, clunky feel.  With the i-Blason, I was always removing my device to go back to the superior naked feel.  With the Poetic case, my device stays in it's protective case at all times.  And frankly, the Poetic case just looks better, due to its thin and uniform design.  Not to mention, it costs a lot less.  I've also heard good things about the comparable Moko case, but I don't have personal experience.  The only good thing I would say about the i-Blason case as an advantage is the stylus loop, which the Poetic case lacks.",

One battery holds a charge for ~10 min; the other (my long life battery) won't last 10 sec. I've been through batteries before, but I've never seen performance degrade this severely or quickly. I hardly ever shut my laptop off-only hibernate-so only recently did I see a startup message saying that this adapter was not optimal (don't remember exact wording) for my laptop, even though the listing says it is. And the plug that goes into the laptop is now loose and comes out often. I've just placed an order for new batteries and adapters, and am going back to genuine Dell products-it wasn't worth the cost savings.

It's not the most solidly built laptop, but if you're not careless, I can see it holding up just fine.  My primary objective was to move away from desktop computing, to a laptop that could give me the same level of computing on my lap.  Mission accomplished!  I've added a few other goodies to my home network to optimize my use of this laptop; a wireless color MFP, a NAS drive...and all of the apps etc. to get it integrated with my Roku and other smart devices.  I even threw in a USB powered 2TB drive to do quick backups on the side (even though the NAS does this).....I'm a firm believer in a 3 set backup minimum, especially with digital photos.  Main drive, plus 2 other sets suits me fine.  A SSD upgrade will be done at some point, but right now after 1 week of use, things are working great!  Don't even bother looking at chromebooks etc. if you need a main computer....it's not the lightest, neatest thing, but it's a great overall computer.....I even have a USB powered 22&#34; monitor setup on my desk as a second screen, when it makes it off of my lap and onto the desk :)",

Most computers made mid-2000 and before have some issues handling properly USB devices and can cause them to conflict with your system. I bought my computer in April of 2000 and have had problems plugging this mouse into the USB port; when I use the adapter and plug it into the PS2 port, I have yet to encounter a problem. <br />I've listened to people say they bought this mouse to use in games because of the 5 buttons, but then they say they only can program the main two buttons in the game. Ok, geniuses, think: Go to the control panel and assign those extra buttons to a specific key on the keyboard, the same key that you use for whatever you want to in your game. It really isn't a difficult concept to grasp. :-)<br />Lastly, the drivers are frequently updated by Mircosoft. When I bought this mouse, the software was version 3.0. When I purchased the Intellimouse Optical (for work...I didn't want to spend 55 bucks again on a mouse), it came with version 3.2, and it was only about 7 months apart. All new versions can be found at the Microsoft website. <br />So if you want a good mouse with all the bells and whistles, bite the bullet and write the check. Or charge the card.

I received the device and found the included \\\\\"tips\\\\\" that I would use were to plug in only the USB port. And there's only one USB charging port on this battery! I need to use 2, maybe 3 USB ports at times for charging. This \\\\\"free tips every year\\\\\" is more of a gimmick since they are not really free once you add in shipping. Just to get to three devices charging, I'm looking at spending more than anticipated. I am more than irritated at this product, and will likely be returning it. The exciting 18,000mAh is useless if you can't plug in the many devices that it says it can charge!  This is probably only good if you are using it for laptop and cell phone, or  be ready to put out much more money for all the tips you need.

I am really getting frustated the way Apple and Google seem to be systematically destroying RIM by witholding crucial software, and I do not think it is an accident or some sort of programming hurdle.<br /><br />I resent Google the most since I am an iMac owner and am a fan of apple and even the iPhone for instance.  I do not own an iPhone but unfortunately I think I may get one soon simply because I don't have the time as I used to to spend hours coding workarounds to get apps that should be readily available.  It PISSES me off that I will give in to the pressure that Apple and Google are exerting and bow down before them simply because I am overwhelmed with how far they have gone to make it difficult to use simple apps such as Hulu or Netflix.  I do like my tablet mainly for streaming vide and browsing the web at home in the evening.<br /><br />The only thing that I have found some relief with is that I can connectt directly to my Plex server and at least through that access my Movie, Music, and media collection along with a few corporate channels that are available.  Netflic used to be one of those of course.<br /><br />I am giving this 5 starts because it is so well made, you can just feel the quality when you hold it inyour hand, the processor speed is fantastic and it multitasks like a beast.  I would normally have removed a star because I can not get Netflix and Hulu which are my main apps for video straming, but I refuse to punish RIM for this obviously conspiracy to remove them from the competition pool.<br /><br />The ONLY hope I see for RIM is if they can honestly off a device with total NSA and hacker proof encryption.  If they were to focus their entire marketing campaign on security I think they could win over millions of customers that are sick and tired of the way Android and even Apple are just handing over all of our personaldata and even profiting from it (makes me want to vomit).<br /><br />So listen up RIM!!!  Your busniess model needs to change and your only focus should be in security, privacy, and encryotion from every angle and commit to your customers that although the security environment is constantly evolving, they are committed to stay one step ahead of the threat of revealing your personal info on their devices.  Of course what sites you visit (facebbok, linked, etc) are on you and RIM can not help you there, but they should be able to secure your search queries, your e-mails, and your interpersonal communication like video and audio chat.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.<br /><br />THIS IS THE BEST TABLET IMO, I just hate the lack of the most popular apps.  Do not hesitate to buy this as it is truly an amazing and beautiful device.  I am actually seriously considering my plans for a new iphone and instead going for a new Blackberry Q10 or the awesome Passport!<br /><br />Come on people show your support for RIM and let's keep it alove, because if we let Apple and Google win, we will have completely given up our freedom of choice in the cellular arena because the only other competitor is the MS Windows phone and IMO it's a piece of junk.",

I didn't have any options to program the buttons or the scroll. But that itself didn't bother me. The mouse is very small, the smallest I've ever seen and used. Now I know why they call it mini (Minne Mouse, LOL) I have very small hands and for me this was even too small. The left and right buttons are so close when trying to use the left button I was getting the scroll. The USB cord is only 27 inches long. When the cord was fully extended I couldn't use the mouse on the right side of the keyboard as the computer is on the left side and the cord wouldn't reach. The cord length might be more appropriate for use on a laptop but since I don't have one I couldn't try it. When I tried to retract it, the side with the mouse retracted, not the USB side. No matter how many times I tried to retract the other end it wouldn't. The colored lights are a novelty and for me din't add anything to the use of the mouse. It did however reinforce my impression that this mouse is more a toy than a functional mouse. I wouldn't even keep this to use as a backup in case my logitech mouse fails.

While 5 hours is a bit high, for normal use 3 to 4 is a very rough range. Even so, 3 hours is a long longer than some PC laptops gets, such as my old Compaq Presario 2195US. Even more so than the long battery life, though, which in itself is amazing, is the seamless transition from running from the power adapter and running from the battery. Unlike the Compaq I mentioned before, in which XP would switch to the battery settings, dimming the screen and slowing it down (and even when I set it to maximum performance it still seemed slower) everything stays the same. No kidding. Unplug. No difference. Plug it in. The same thing. While trying to setup my wireless network, I forgot to plug it in, running off the battery the entire time without even knowing it. When I finally did, I was amazed that I wasn't running from the wall: it was exactly the same experience as when it was plugged in. So for that 4 hours you get the most amazing experience due, in part, to Mac OS X. <br /> <br />In terms of power--RAM, CPU, etc.--I am impressed. The standard 256MB RAM that comes with the computer is simply not enough, and I've had a few slow-downs even with an extra 512MB installed (for a total of 768MB RAM). Albeit I was running a dozen large applications, the point is that extra RAM is a must and that maxing it out is the best thing you can do, so long as you have the extra money to spend. It really makes a difference. As far as raw processor power goes, I found it a bit slow at first (though much faster than a 1.33GHz PC). My experience here is sordid, though, because I at first owned an 867MHz Rev. A PowerBook for about a month or so before trading it in for this Rev. C beauty. Regardless, whatever slowdowns I experiences at first are all but gone--or I've grown used to them. Either way, this thing runs like a Ferrari. <br /> <br />I can't really comment on its size and weight, as I have yet to carry it around with me much, but I will make a note of the screen size: despite it being merely 12\\\\\"--quite smaller than the 15\\\\\" screens I have been using on laptops for the past year--I was accustomed to it almost immediately. I remember using my mom's laptop at one point a week after buying this that looking at her 15.4\\\\\" widescreen was just.. I was thunderstruck at how large it was. Afterwards, I went back to my laptop, and saw a normal-sized screen. I was incredulous before making my purchase, people who said the screen was fine being quite unconvincing, but I have to say that they were absolutely right. You get used to it in an instant, and everything else is, well, huge in comparison. <br /> <br />And how quiet it is! I've never been one to be bothered by the sound of computer fans--though the ones in my old desktop were outrageously loud and annoying--and thought my old laptop to have been quiet, but after using a PowerBook for two months, I know better. I would classify my old Compaq as not loud, as it truly wasn't, but definitely not quiet. Quiet is this, my PowerBook. More than a few times I've made a reach for the power button, and even begun to press it, before I realized that it was asleep, usually brushing against my mouse and awakening the computer, the screen glowing as it came to life. That is quiet. <br /> <br />I simply must mention Mac OS X, even though it isn't a hardware part of the PowerBook. It has made my experience exponentially better. Though odd at first--I had to relearn how to make line breaks in IM clients, how to use the Command key as often as the Control key, and even learn the combos (Command+Shift+Letter, for instance)--it really has made computing more fun. I know it sounds corny, and at first it wasn't that way, but having grown used to it, seeing some of the applications out there, using them, etc., I couldn't be happier. On top of a different way of obtaining most apps--that is, paying for them via credit card and simply buying the CD key, then downloading the trial software and unlocking all the features--there is such a diverse selection to choose from. For instance, there's iComic, which, using Perl scripts, allows you to view [web]comics from within it, and even download them to your hard drive automatically. I don't know of any PC program that does this. As opposed to doing everything with one program, you have multiple, smaller, more efficient applications. For instance, instead of using Photoshop to slowly and painstakingly fade the ends of my images out to a white, I can simply set a template in, say, Yellow Mug Software's EasyFrame, drag all my files into it, and it'll do the same thing automatically. Which brings up arguably the best part: the widespread use of drag 'n' drop. The most basic and amazing use being that, when you want to open a file in a non-default program, instead of right clicking, going to Open with..., etc., you can simply drag the file to the application in question and drop it on it, automatically opening it in that application. <br /> <br />Overall, my experience with this PowerBook, and its OS, has been nothing short of stunning; amazing; the greatest computer experience of my life. Not only is it fun, but the OS is unparalleled and it finds the balance PC laptops can only dream of achieving: being portable without sacrificing performance.",

It's exactly the same, except is has a logo \\\\\"innax YT-5015\\\\\" instead of \\\\\"Frisby\\\\\". The sound has degenerated over that time, and now it's very bothersome to listen to. The center speaker started buzzing a bit, and now any time the subwoofer is on, it is a single-tone buzz/rumble that is very distracting. Of course, the reason it probably has dropped performance is that when the 1 Amp fuse burned out, I replaced it with a 5 amp fuse. I'm guessing the drivers blew out that way.<br /><br />For years this system did all right, so if you're on a tight budget, this makes a good choice, especially since the receiver is built right into the sub. You can adjust the front, center, rear, and sub channels individually with the remote and on the sub, which is nice. One downside is that there are 6 coax inputs, which means you'll be swapping RCA plugs every time you want to switch a sound source.<br /><br />One big downside was how bright the LEDs are. If you keep it next to the TV, the lights are almost blindingly bright, and  if you have a video projector like me, putting the sub on the wall opposite the screen still illuminates the entire image somewhat noticeably.<br /><br />One nice feature is that is has a standby mode, and the system looks pretty good and the construction is solid.<br /><br />I will not be buying this system again, because my there are some movies that demand full sound, like TRON legacy.",

During the writes the the SimpleNet CPU was pegged at 100% (CPU bound) and during the reads the SimpleNet CPU was at 50% (not CPU bound).    For the price this is a great device. I use it to store my pictures, mp3 audio, etc... My files are not large (less then 2GB) so I can't comment on some of the errors other reviewers have seen. So far I don't have any problems the reading the data. The transfer rate of 13 Mbps is sufficient for me. I have been working with computers for over 30 years so the slowness of the system does not bother me (I remember the days of 300 Baud modems). Copying folders with many files can be problematic.    The device was very simple to set up. I found the IP address of the device on my router. I used my browser to attach to it. The menus are very easy to understand.    If you have Unix experience I would recommend that you download PUTTY and SSH to the SimpleNet device. The one error I have found in the manual so far is that if you are going to change the password to the sshadmin account qualify the account (passwd sshadmin).    For the price I am completely satisfied. I was planning to build my own Linux server but I saw this device on sale and gave it a shot. It is so small and inexpensive I had to try it and I am glad I did.    I have tried the Xmeta and Netgear (SC101) NAS devices. They are definitely faster, but they are bigger and require extra drivers to manage and utilize them. The SimpleNet device does not. If you are a Unix user I think you will get a kick out of logging into the box playing with it.    UPDATE:    Streaming 320x240 avi video works. 640x480 and 1280 x 720 avi's do not.     I attached a FAT32 drive to the SimpleNet and the write rates tripled to 15Mbps and the reads were a little of 16Mbps.The behavior of this product is erratic in terms of stability if you use it as a samba server with FAT32.     I installed winSCP and used the FTP option. The behavior of the SimpleNet is very stable as an FTP server. The read and write rates are around 15 Mbps.      Summary:    As an FTP server it is a stable with ok transfer speeds. As a samba server with NTFS it is slow and problematic (copying folders with many files), with FAT32 it is slow (faster than NTFS), erratic and problematic.    After playing with it for several days I have lowered the rating to 3 stars.    If you looking for a windows file server it does work slowly. If you looking for an FTP server works fine and is stable.",

I am a computer enthusiast, so I understand that sometimes this happens, and I am also not arrogant enough to brush aside a company for one bad board. So I went with this board, and I must say from the ease of installation to the one click, that's right, one click overclocking an i5 2600K to 4.6 GHz as well as just having a very stylish form factor it is simply a must have board for any occasions. As a side note I highly recommend the V8 Cooler Master to go along with this board, because well it keeps my OC CPU at a cozy 25 degrees Celsius. Also the V8 cooler fits just right so that it doesn't interfere with he RAM at all... One final note is that if you have a big GPU then you cannot fit two, so my advice is to get a very good graphics card and forget about SLI, and Crossfire with this board.",

I have requested another to give Vantec the benefit of the doubt but I shall be quick to respond if the replacement is as bad as my initial purchase.<br />UPDATE<br />I have discovered from the Vantec support team that the bay is powered by a power supply rated at 5.42A. Each of my drives requires 0.9A for the 5V and 0.75A for the 12V side. All four drives require 6.3A which is too much for the supply. Running with three drives (4.95A) works fine.

(Worry about elastic \\\\\"elasticity\\\\\" over time with frequent in-and-out action but what are you going to do. (Seriously, what are you going to do?)<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The depth. The portfolio has almost no room for anything beyond a caseless iPad, and iPhone and a pad of paper. If you actually put gear in the various pouches, pockets and zippered compartment I believe you will risk damaging your iPad screen or ripping the zipper trying to close the portfolio.<br /><br />The Opportunity<br /><br />In my opinion the following recommendations would make this product much much better:<br /><br />1. Increase the depth. The increase wouldn't have a substantial impact on the form factor, i.e., weight or dimensions but would greatly improve functionality.<br /><br />2. Get a little more creative with the pouches. I have a rubber iPhone case and sliding the phone in and out of the pouches is awkward. Though the pouches are lined with fabric, the friction factor is still an issue. I love M-Edge. I did a ton of research when buying my Kindle case and hands down, M-Edge was consistently innovative and smart about their products. So frankly I expect more than the same ol' same ol', which is how the pouches feel.<br /><br />3. Lose the magnetic clasps on the pouches. From hotel key cards to floppy disks, magnets scare me and I don't like the idea of them anywhere near my electronics. (Okay, the floppy disk comment was an anachronistic throwback to a previous century but I think my paranoia is still justified.)<br /><br />4. Do consumers really want four slots for credit cards and a transparent slot for an ID? Yes I appreciate being able to use the portfolio as a wallet when traveling I guess. But four slots that are difficult to manipulate (very very tight) seems more of the same ol' same ol' school of design. Don't be a follower M-Edge! Be the leader you are.<br /><br />5. Perhaps think about cord management? If you know people are putting iPads in these cases, why not come up with a clean means of holding a sync cable and a USB power adapter. If I had to guess I bet people would be completely jiggy with forsaking the transparent ID slot and credit card holders for some nifty ways of storing headphones and other paraphernalia.<br /><br />Enough.

I might need to have some rest from the computer for a while, I will give it a try again after that.  Related to other functionality: it works great, haven't tested for gaming but it seems not to have delay on the signal, it works fine on most surfaces (even on the couch), there's no visible light coming from the optical part, the pointer speed button is very convenient and works fine. Works out of the box with box Mac and PC, and some of the extra buttons have extra functionality on Windows (7) without need of any drivers (like, you can open links in new tabs). Auto scrolling works with Mac as well, which was a bit unexpected.  My wife, who doesn't spend that much time at the computer, says is a good mouse, comfortable for her and responsive.

This is a 10\\\\\" tablet. Its rivals are the Galaxy Tab 10, the ASUS Transformer, the Archos G9, and a host of other tablets. The K1 has one advantage over the others - it has oodles of storage, with 32Gb in the version that competes with the lowest priced of its rivals.<br /><br />The K1 has a decent enough screen too.<br /><br />Now let's look at what's wrong with it.<br /><br />Hardware<br /><br />1. The proprietary dock connector<br /><br />There's no USB port or charger port on this tablet. Instead, connections are via a proprietary dock connector, which can either be used with the USB cable, or the charger, but not both. Don't lose your USB cable, there's no way to replace it.<br /><br />2. No USB charging<br /><br />If you lose your charger - well, the good news is Lenovo has finally started selling them. But don't expect to use a regular USB charger to charge it - it's not going to work.<br /><br />3. The slope<br /><br />Staggeringly, Lenovo has made a semi-permanent choice for you on the age old question: should I read this PDF in landscape, or play this game in portrait? The bottom of the tablet is angled such that the tablet can only be used in portrait mode if you're holding it. Put it down, and it'll slope towards one of the wider ends, forcing landscape mode. There's a slider button on one side to kind of override that, but it's fiddly and, frankly, a lot of apps ignore it.<br /><br />4. The button<br /><br />So, you're trying to hold your tablet. Make sure you don't hold the side with the entirely unnecessary button that does the same thing that the joypad thing does on an Android phone. This button is not supported by the Honeycomb operating system. It should not be there. That it's there is many accidents waiting to happen, which they do.<br /><br/>5. Oh that dock again, and the headphone jack, are on the \\\\\"bottom\\\\\"<br /><br />...which means that you can't stand it up when you're listening to music or charging it because doing so causes the tablet to balance on the cable-side of whatever's plugged in to it.<br /><br />6. Battery not user replaceable.<br /><br />I know, nobody cares, Apple says you can just throw away your $400 widget and buy a new one when the battery is dead, but I care.<br /><br />7. USB client only<br /><br />You can attach the device to a computer for transferring files. You can't, however, attach USB devices to it (such as USB flash sticks.) Lenovo has hinted that all that's needed is the right cable - but have chosen not to make such a thing.<br /><br />Software<br /><br />Lenovo has added some nice tools to Honeycomb but you need to be aware of the following:<br /><br />1. The pre-installed OS is awful<br /><br />...which means you'll have to update it. No big deal, except you have to manually install EVERY SINGLE UPDATE Lenovo has released for the tablet. I'm not kidding. The entire process - go to Settings, About tablet, System updates, Start to check new version, Yes, {wait}, {reboot}, {wait} - had to be repeated about five or six times when I first got mine last November. And while it may look for updates automatically, installing them still needs confirmation each step of the way.<br /><br />2. The updated OS isn't exactly fantastic<br /><br />The tablet is relatively speedy, it can run GTA III without breaking a sweat, but for some reason just scrolling through a web page can tax the system so much you actually see it rendering the text. Good grief. And no, it's not reliable, I have to reboot mine periodically, although the latest update suggests its getting better.<br /><br />3. Will it get Icecream Sandwich?<br /><br />Don't ask Lenovo, because you will NOT get a straight answer. Lenovo's official forums are currently full of people going absolutely bananas trying to get this question answered. The likely answer right now is no. It looks like Lenovo intends to abandon the K1 completely, but they're under a lot of pressure, so who knows?<br /><br />Miscellaneous<br /><br />I can be one room over from my Wireless gateway and only get the bearest of signals. Right now I'm in an office and there's a gateway barely ten feet from me - one out of five bars. My cellphone reports the same gateway with all bars. Again, Lenovo forums show many, many, people hopping mad over this. The weird part is it didn't used to be that big a problem.<br /><br />Is it worth getting? No. Quite simply, it's a lemon. I cannot emphasize how strongly I feel on this. My suspicion is that the K1 was designed to not compete with the much more favorably reviewed Thinkpad tablet, but there's bad, and then there's just awful, and this is just awful.<br /><br />Avoid.",

The web browser is impressively fast (those reviewing it as okay or slow need to fix there wi-fi connection) and accommodates all my web browsing needs. You can store multiple wi-fi connection points and it will automatically connect soon as you are in range. My neighbors and I both have wi-fi networks and I can go from my house to theirs with out loosing connection.<br /><br />I was highly impressed with the video playback and streaming quality.<br />The video playback is brilliant and smooth. The screen size is more than adequate to watch a full movie and enjoy it in vibrant rich color. You can take advantage of streaming tons of movies and shows from amazon prime (i like using amazon prime personally even though I have netflix) or download and stream from netflix or hulu.<br /><br />Book reading is enjoyable with several custom features to cater to your personal reading preferences. Reading e-comics on it are another enjoyable experience with the ability to just flip through page by page or read it with animated frame by frame scrolling. The kindle with its *case still only weighs as much as a small book. (My *case purchased by roocase doubles as a multi angled stand for easy reading and general use).<br /><br />I don't understand why people are complaining about where the power button is, I don't see the problem.<br />One: even if you do bump it, that only turns the screen off. It doesn't turn the kindle off completely.<br />Two: the screen has 360 degree turn  radius so if you think it should be on the top, turn it upside down and the screen flips over. Problem solved!!!<br />Three: if it was placed where others suggest, someone else would complain that it should be on the bottom. They had to place it some where so they did. Get over it!!!<br /><br />The main page has fast access to all its program functions. I like the custom favorite list at the bottom (which resembles a book shelf) which allows you to arrange all your favorite apps websites and even songs and videos downloaded or streamed in any order you wish for easy access to the things you like the most. I like that it isn't bulky or cumbersome to carry around. It is slim, light weight, able to be carried in a coat or hoodie pocket.

But my technique, like many good artists and gamers, is to keep the corner of my palm planted on the desk, as I do when using a pen or pencil.  The two advantages are that it takes the weight and strain off my the arm, and it puts the mouse entirely under the fine motor control of my fingers.  Obviously, this is impossible if the mouse is so huge.  I'm pretty much limited to cupping my hand over this thing, meaning I can't leverage any coordinated muscle groups to steer this Titanic.<br />Other complaints: the shape isn't really that good either, it feels hollow, the side buttons are hard to reach, and the buttons feel loose instead of solid.  <br />So I sold it and got the Logitech optical wheel mouse instead, and it's the best mouse I've ever used.

The router is only 25 feet away from the network adapter, and there's almost a clear line-of-sight between them.    The adapter installed fine, but to my surprise, it couldn't see the 5GHz network. Much configuring and many router+machine reboots did not improve this situation. This is utterly baffling, since the 802.11n network adapter from another manufacturer in another machine can see and connect to the 5GHz network just fine.    It could connect fine to the 2.4GHz network, and it reported a connection speed of 270Mbps. However, whenever I initiated a file transfer from any site, the reported connection speed drops to 54Mbps (the convention for 802.11g), and the maximum transfer throughput was a poky 500Kps (4Mbps)... which is about on par with an average-performing 802.11g-class adapter.    I completely don't understand why this latest-generation D-Link adapter can't communicate properly with the latest-generation D-Link router. It makes no sense.

This Targus chill mat has dual fans which are much more effective, and the built-in channel between the top and bottom sections allow for ample air circulation.  The rubberized top surface keeps the notebook in place.  The bottom surface has a fabric-like lining that's comfortable on the lap and still stable ontop of a desk.  Simple, well-thought out and effective design indeed.  My wife's quite happy with it, and I would get this again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Update [10/29/2012]:<br />Dropped to 2 stars.  After about 2 months of using this, it seems the fans are no longer providing enough cooling. Actually, my wife now tells me that she barely feels the fan, and her laptop is heating up a lot again.  This is now just providing a surface to keep the laptop elevated for airflow, and a barrier to protect one's lap from the laptop high temperature.

So naturally I went Online. This case is almost exactly what I was looking for. I've only had it for a little over a month, but it has served me well so far. I don't know how well it will protect your tablet against drops. I haven't tried drop testing, for obvious reasons. It seems to be really good for everyday use though. I take my Surface with me in my bag, and I wouldn't feel comfortable transporting it without some kind of protective case.<br /><br />I have the 64 gig Surface RT, with a Typecover. It fits in the case just fine, even with the Typecover attached. The other day I also had my iPad 2 with me, so I decided to slip it into the case along with my Surface. It was a snug fit, but both tablets did fit securely inside the sleeve.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this case is the top flap. All of the problems you have with this case will be directly related to the flap. At first, it's tricky to get your tablet in and out of the case, because you have to learn to monkey with the flap. Once you figure it out, getting your tablet in or out of the case becomes a relatively quick and painless process. I like to pop the top corners in, and kind of roll the flap over the tablet.<br /><br />Even though I haven't had the case for long, I can tell the flap will be the first thing to go wrong. The seams around the flap are already starting to show wear, no doubt from having to fold it over to get your tablet in or out. It's very possible I will wear the flap out, maybe even tear it loose from the case. If that happens, I'll probably continue to use it. The seams along the sides and bottom are rock solid. For the life of me, I can't figure out why they designed the flap the way they did. If it just folded over and was secured with a button or piece of velcro, it would undoubtedly extend the life of the case. Itwould also make it easier to use. If by some miracle the developers of the case read this review, please take note. Maybe there will be a second generation of this case with design improvements.<br /><br />In the meantime, I may order another one of these cases. It's even cheaper now. I paid a few dollars more for mine, not that I regret it. If you want an inexpensive case for your Surface RT, I'd highly recommend this one. Just don't expect it to last forever, eventually the stitching will start to come loose. Three Stars instead of Four, because of the ill-conceived flap.",

Once you enlarge them enough for them to be readable, you have to go back and forth a lot. I prefer to turn the text on its side and squint from there. Much easier.    Anyways, for something that's not really made for reading PDF files, I'm just thrilled that I have the option to put them on there, even though they're difficult to read.",
