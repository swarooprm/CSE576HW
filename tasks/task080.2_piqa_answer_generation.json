In the past, it was treated by increasing the temperature of the tank to to above 85 degrees and adding aquarium salt. This method is not always effective, and heat resistant strains of the parasite have been identified. The best method to treat Ich is a two pronged attack. First, feed fish food treated with Metronidazole. This will kill the parasite while it is attached to the fishes body and gills. Secondly, treat the tank water with Seachem's Paraguard. Unlike many other medications, Paraguard is safe for use on scaleless fish and invertebrates. Metro should be used with caution with ornamental snails."
