I've prepared a few rules regarding the use of the motor vehicles in this house. Daughter: Like what? Father: Let me get my notes here. Daughter: Dad! That looks like a book? Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times. Father: Yeah. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Rule number two: You always must wear your seat belt and obey the rules of the road. Daughter: Duh. I wasn't born yesterday. Father: Okay, rule number three: You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road. But driving to the movie theater is fine. Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier. Daughter: Hey, having the car keys in my hands changes my whole perspective on life. Father: Well, okay. I guess if I'm considered the best dad in the world for five minutes, then I'll accept that.

The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it.

M: That's nice, Sherry. But do you mean the province of Quebec or Quebec City? W: I mean the province. My friend's wedding is in Montreal, so I'm going there first. I'll stay for 5 days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province? M: Well, many people think so because it's the biggest city, but it's not the capital. Quebec City is, but Montreal is great. The Santa Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer. W: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is okay, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English? M: Well, people speak both French and English there, but you'll hear French most of the time and all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go. W: Good advice, what about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like? M: It's a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored. Some of them were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. You'll love it there. W: Fantastic. I can't wait to go., Question: What can we know about Montreal?",

I've designed many fashion items for a number of Italian companies, and during the last four years, I've also been designing for the British company, Burberry's. M: What have you been designing for them? W: Mostly handbags, and small leather goods. M: Has the fashion industry in Italy changed since 1982? W: Oh, yes. It has become a lot more competitive. Because of quality of products from other countries has improved a lot. But the Italian quality and design is still world-famous. M: And do you ever think of returning to live in England?

Another trial would be trying to get over the love of my life, my baby's father. We were engaged, but things went the other way. I had to learn to love myself more than I loved a man.

Vet, what was life like for you as a child? Vet: Life was fun. I was always very loved, even without my father around. I was somewhat of a troublemaker, but I have a lot of good memories to show for it. Being a child was the best time of my life. Crystal: How have your childhood years affected who you are today? Vet: I was raised by very strong, supportive people. My mother and sisters have a lot to do with who I am. I also learned many lessons, good and bad, which have made me a strong adult. They have helped me realize what I need to do to be happy. My mother has always been the best person in my life. She has never let me down, and has always been very supportive. Whenever I needed a friend, she was one. My sisters have also been there for me. When my morn was getting her college degree, she would be out late, and my sisters stepped in and played morn. They are my best friends and give me great advice. Crystal: What have been some of your biggest trials, and how have you overcome them? Vet: The biggest trial in my life was when I got pregnant sophomore year. It was a new road to travel. I didn't have to get over it, I had to accept it and learn to adapt. Another trial would be trying to get over the love of my life, my baby's father. We were engaged, but things went the other way. I had to learn to love myself more than I loved a man. Crystal: Who helped you during your pregnancy? Vet: My morn and sisters were everything I needed them to be-a mother, sister, boyfriend, best friend and father. All my friends were there for me, I could cry to them whenever I needed to. I'm especially thankful for my morn. It was hard for her to deal with two pregnant children at the same time. The dad and his family were also there, which was a blessing Crystal: When a bad situation comes up, what do you do? Vet: I try to find the best way to deal with it. I am often faced with issues in my school about my race. It is not easy to keep your temper, but you have to try to understand why people are upset and angry. I try to find a way out without hurting anyone, or. myself. Crystal: How has being so small and pregnant affected your body? Vet: It has worn me out. My body is stretched in places I never knew I had. My hips are huge, I won't be a model again anytime soon. Being pregnant so young has emotionally drained me. I have so many things to worry about now, and my emotions are like a roller coaster. One minute I am happy, and the next depressed. I never spend time on my appearance. I'm always focusing on my baby., Question: When Vet was pregnant, her mother and sisters were everything she needed them to be but ______.",

Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner. Kids: We had to use the fire extinguisher. Chef Randall: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. \"Another fattening cookie recipe.\" But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family. Kids: We still like the fat though. Chef Randall: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything? Kids: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home. Chef Randall: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then., Question: At what temperature should you bake the cookies?",
