facts there the defendants counterclaimed against the plaintiffs both of which were insurance companies for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay 2008 wl 4178474 at 1 one of the contracts in dispute contained a choiceoflaw provision which provided that the law of the state of new york would apply in the event that the parties disputed the validity or formation of the contract or the meaning interpretationf or operation of any term condition definition or provision of the contract resulting in litigation arbitration or other form of dispute resolution id at 3 the parties disputefd whether this clause coverfed defendants bad faith claim  id at 4 after noting that new york courts are generally reluctant to construe choice of law provisions broadly and that extracontractual claims such as tort claims that arise only incidentally to the contract were not covered by the choice of law clause the court then looked to new york law to determine whether defendants badfaith claim was best characterized as contractual or tortious id at 4 internal quotation marks omitted the court held that new york law considers the duty to act in good faith as controlled by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing found in every contract and that therefore a bad faith claim is treated as a breach of the underlying contract for the purposes of applying a choice of law provision id internal quotation marks omitted collecting cases the court further noted that the basic holding of the cases to which it had cited that the same states law should govern both the contract and bad faith claims applies with equal force where the choice of law for the contract dispute is determined by a contractual choice of law provision id at 5 an unnecessarily confusing situation would result if different laws were to govern the contract and bad faith claims id internal quotation marks omitted reasoning that the breach of contract and bad faith claims are inextricably intertwined and should be governed by the laws of the same state and noting that new york law governs the claim for breach of contract the court concluded that new york law should also apply to the bad faith refusal to pay claim relating to these contracts idwhile apparently applying though not always explicitly citing to new york law other courts within this district have taken a similar approach both before and after commerce see eg torain v clear channel broad inc 651 fsupp2d 125 138 sdny2009 the court will apply texas substantive law to determine whether the plaintiff was discharged for cause under the terms of the employment agreement and whether the defendant is entitled to indemnification for the settlement payment moreover because the plaintiffs claim for breach of the implied covenant of good

2001 the court notes that the parties indicated in their agreement that it would be governed and construed according to delaware law since the implied covenant of good faith is a rule of interpretation rather than a separate obligation the cjourt holds that a claim for breach of the covenant is a contractual cause of action and therefore delaware law applies to the plaintiffs claim

fair dealing  seeks to enforce a covenant if it is to be done it must be done as an additional term of the agreement the choiceoflaw issue with respect to that claim is not a difficult one this court has little doubt that if  illinois law governs the contract  it is no jump at all to find that any efforts to engraft implied terms into the agreement  should be measured under the law of illinois the court finds the reasoning of these cases to be persuasive as a result it applies new york law to find that alaska law applies to plaintiffs cause of action for violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealingb analysisas explained in the conflict of law analysis above there is an actual conflict between new york and alaska law on this issue and alaska law controls the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in all contracts in alaska casey v semco energy inc 92 p3d 379 384 alaska 2004 generally speaking claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing are contract claims as under new york law the alaska supreme court has explainedin the case of an ordinary commercial contract between sophisticated business entities a tort for breach arises only when a partys conduct rises to the level of a traditionally recognized tort creating a broader tort remedy would disrupt the certainty of commercial transactions and allow parties to escape

ariz 188 624 p2d 866 868 1981 holding that tort liability applies when dealing with its insured on a claim the decision to extend a tort cause of action to these circumstances is based on public policy considerations unique to the insuredinsurer relationship in particular in allowing an insured to bring a tort cause of action for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the alaska supreme court has recognized the special relationship between insurer and insured the use of standardized contract terms the insurers superior bargaining position over the insured and the fact that the insured seeks protection against calamity rather than commercial advantage transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also nicholson 777 p2d at 1157 the adhesionary aspects of the insurance contract including the lack of bargaining strength of the insured the contracts standardized terms the motivation of the insured for entering into the transaction and the nature of the service for which the contract is executed distinguish this contract from most other noninsurance commercial contracts these features characteristic of the insurance contract make it particularly susceptible to public policy considerations alaska pac assurance co v collins 794 p2d 936 947 alaska 1990 due to the unequal bargaining positions which generally exist between insurers and insureds enforcement of this covenant is particularly important in the insurance context characterizing such actions between the insured and insurer as sounding in tort and thereby permitting tort damages will provide needed incentive to insurers to honor their implied covenant to their insureds citations and internal quotation marks omitted as amended on denial of rehg aug 30 1990 the alaska supreme court has reasoned that these exceptional features of the insurance contract justified the creation of a tort action for an insurers bad faith breach transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774in deciding against extending the tort cause of action to situations other than the ones described above the alaska supreme court has emphasized that the public policy considerations that formed the basis for extension of the tort cause of action were not present in other circumstances for example in municipality of anchorage v gentile the alaska supreme court considered whether there should be a cause of action in tort for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where the municipality of anchorage reduced the postretirement medical benefits of its retired police officers and firefighters 922 p2d at 252 in deciding against allowing a tort cause of action the alaska supreme court determined that pjublic policy concerns do not require the imposition of tort liability in this case id at 261 in particular the alaska supreme court reasoned that the underlying concern that warranted a tort cause of action is that without the threat of tort liability insurance companies may be encouraged to delay payment of claims to their insureds with an eye toward settling for a lesser amount than due under the policy id internal quotation marks omitted the alaska supreme court therefore held that the case law that allowed for a tort cause of action related to insurance contracts simply did not apply in that caseit is unnecessary to decide here whether the municipality would be subject to tort liability for failing to deal fairly and in good faith in the settlement of a covered insurance claim that is not the nature of the plaintiffs claim they instead claim that the municipality breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by unilaterally decreasing the insurance coverage required by the collective bargaining agreements although insurance is the topic in dispute the municipality breached the collective bargaining agreements not policies of insuranceid thus thealaska supreme court recognized that it was not just the subject matter of insurance that yields this tort cause of action but that special factors must be also be present and it also indicated an aversion to extending the cases providing for a cause of action in tort past the circumstances of those casesthe parties have not cited any case where an alaska court either applied pr declined to apply a tort cause of action for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in circumstances similar to the case at hand nor has the court found any such case in its own research in the absence of such authority and in light of the public policy considerations explicitly relied on by the alaska courts and persuasive authority from outside the district the court holds that plaintiffs cannot bring a separate claim for the breach of the implied covenant in this case the public policy considerations that alaska courts have relied on in other insurance cases are decidedly not present in this case simply put this is not a case where there are standardized contract terms where the insurer has superior bargaining power and where the insured seeks protection against calamity instead of commercial advantage see transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also ppm 3 purchase of the policy is suitable only for persons of substantial economic means and financial sophistication each policy owner will be required to represent that he or she meets certain minimum financial and other suitability standards while the contract is technically an insurance contract it is much more similar to an average commercial contract than to a typical insurance contract nor is this a case about an insurer resolving claims covered by its insurance policy see gentile 922 p2d at 261 the court also finds the reasoning in michael s rulle family dynasty trust v agl life assurance co no 10cv231 2010 wl 2721029 edpa july 7 2010 instructive in that case which is very similar to this case the eastern district of pennsylvania reasoned thatalthough insurance might play a tangential role here it is not the center of the dispute this claim revolves around the investment made as part of a life insurance policy and has nothing to do with the insurance aspect of the policy there is no allegation that agl failed to investigate a claim or that the plaintiff was in an unequal bargaining position and hence found itself signing a contract of adhesion additionally the plaintiff in this case is the rulle trust which is not a person nor is it the insured finally the agl ppm includes minimum suitability requirements for potential policy owners given the circumstances surrounding this policy it is not clear that alaska would recognize a tort for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing hereid at 13 citation and internal quotation marks omitted based on this reasoning and the reasoning in the alaska cases see gentile 922 p2d at 260 the covenant of good faith and fair dealing primarily sounds in contract transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 holding that an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for a normal commercial contract sounds in contract alone the court declines to allow a cause of action in

court rejected a claim for negligent breach of an insurance contract however language in that case actually supports plaintiffs claim see alaska pac assurance 794 p2d at 946 agreeing with the argument that an insurer may be held liable for torts independent from its contractual duties such as fraud but that an action for negligence in breaching a specific contractual duty sounds in contract as defendant correctly argued in the context of plaintiffs breach of contract claim plaintiffs do not successfully allege the breach of a specific contractual duty rather they allege a negligence tort apart from the enumerated contractual duty to provide an annual statement second defendant is correct that reasoning in dicta by the district court for the district of alaska in st denis v department of housing and urban development did indicate that alaska might not allow tort claims based on purely economic loss see st denis 900 fsupp at 120004 it  appears that alaska cases foreshadow a general rule precluding negligence actions by those in privity where only economic losses are alleged however this appearance has been firmly rebutted in subsequent alaska supreme court decisions eleven years after the st denis decision the alaska supreme court heldwe have recognized that promises set forth in a contract must be enforced by an action on that contract only where the duty breached is one imposed by law such as a traditional tort law duty furthering social policy may an action between contracting parties sound in tort when a partys actions violate a general duty of care its actions may

is a duty imposed by law to avoid causing injury to others it is apart from and independent of promises made and therefore apart from the manifested intention of the parties thus a defendant may be

determined that pjublic policy concerns do not require the imposition of tort liability in this case id at 261 in particular the alaska supreme court reasoned that the underlying concern that warranted a tort cause of action is that without the threat of tort liability insurance companies may be encouraged to delay payment of claims to their insureds with an eye toward settling for a lesser amount than due under the policy id internal quotation marks omitted the alaska supreme court therefore held that the case law that allowed for a tort cause of action related to insurance contracts simply did not apply in that caseit is unnecessary to decide here whether the municipality would be subject to tort liability for failing to deal fairly and in good faith in the settlement of a covered insurance claim that is not the nature of the plaintiffs claim they instead claim that the municipality breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by unilaterally decreasing the insurance coverage required by the collective bargaining agreements although insurance is the topic in dispute the municipality breached the collective bargaining agreements not policies of insuranceid thus thealaska supreme court recognized that it was not just the subject matter of insurance that yields this tort cause of action but that special factors must be also be present and it also indicated an aversion to extending the cases providing for a cause of action in tort past the circumstances of those casesthe parties have not cited any case where an alaska court either applied pr declined to apply a tort cause of action for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in circumstances similar to the case at hand nor has the court found any such case in its own research in the absence of such authority and in light of the public policy considerations explicitly relied on by the alaska courts and persuasive authority from outside the district the court holds that plaintiffs cannot bring a separate claim for the breach of the implied covenant in this case the public policy considerations that alaska courts have relied on in other insurance cases are decidedly not present in this case simply put this is not a case where there are standardized contract terms where the insurer has superior bargaining power and where the insured seeks protection against calamity instead of commercial advantage see transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also ppm 3 purchase of the policy is suitable only for persons of substantial economic means and financial sophistication each policy owner will be required to represent that he or she meets certain minimum financial and other suitability standards while the contract is technically an insurance contract it is much more similar to an average commercial contract than to a typical insurance contract nor is this a case about an insurer resolving claims covered by its insurance policy see gentile 922 p2d at 261 the court also finds the reasoning in michael s rulle family dynasty trust v agl life assurance co no 10cv231 2010 wl 2721029 edpa july 7 2010 instructive in that case which is very similar to this case the eastern district of pennsylvania reasoned thatalthough insurance might play a tangential role here it is not the center of the dispute this claim revolves around the investment made as part of a life insurance policy and has nothing to do with the insurance aspect of the policy there is no allegation that agl failed to investigate a claim or that the plaintiff was in an unequal bargaining position and hence found itself signing a contract of adhesion additionally the plaintiff in this case is the rulle trust which is not a person nor is it the insured finally the agl ppm includes minimum suitability requirements for potential policy owners given the circumstances surrounding this policy it is not clear that alaska would recognize a tort for breach of the

in breaching a specific contractual duty sounds in contract as defendant correctly argued in the context of plaintiffs breach of contract claim plaintiffs do not successfully allege the breach of a specific contractual duty rather they allege a negligence tort apart from the enumerated contractual duty to provide an annual statement second defendant is correct that reasoning in dicta by the

rebutted in subsequent alaska supreme court decisions eleven years after the st denis decision the alaska supreme court heldwe have recognized that promises set forth in a contract must be enforced by an action on that contract only where the duty breached is one imposed by law such as a traditional tort law duty furthering social policy may an action between contracting parties sound in tort when
