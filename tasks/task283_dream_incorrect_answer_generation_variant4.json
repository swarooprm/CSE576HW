Every time a truck went by, I would shout a word that sounded like a track, but to everyone else, it sounded nothing like it. My parents tried to correct me, but failed. Then, about three months later, we traveled to New York, as we were waiting for our plane at the air?port. I looked out of a huge window, at that very moment I saw the largest truck in the world, I had to tell someone about this. I turned to my father who was standing next to about a thousand people waiting for the very flight and screamed \"Track! Track!\" My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited, I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and then ran into the ladies-room where she hid until I finally stopped. Well, I learned how to say truck correctly, and soon I was talking like a normal child.

Track!\" My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited, I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and then ran into the ladies-room where she hid until I finally stopped.

If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court. W: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins? M: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed. W: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves? M: That's the beauty of the whole thing. Ignorance of the law doesn't count, I'm afraid. However, the other person can counter-sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor.
