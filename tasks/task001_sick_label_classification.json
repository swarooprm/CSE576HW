        "Classification"
    ],
    "Definition": "This task is to classify correctly if the given two sentences A and B are entailed or contradict each other, otherwise labelled neutral. Labels are given as entailment (0), neutral (1) or contradiction (2)",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: A dancer is dancing on the stage. sentence_B: A girl is giving dance performance on the dais.",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "One sentence says dancing on the stage while the other sentence says dance performance on the dais, which are clearly giving teh same meaning and are realted to each other. So the classification is entailment."
        },
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: The crowd is cheering at her dance performance., sentence_B: The group is enjoying while eating food.",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "First one says the crowd is cherring at dance performance whereas the second one says enjoying eating the food, there is no relation at all as it is not even contradicting. So it is neutral."
        },
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: A man is standing and has tears of joy seeing the dance performance. sentence_B: There is no man standing with happiness seeing the dance.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "Here first sentence says a man is standing, while the second sentence contradicts saying there is no man standing so clearly this is a contradiction so label 2."
        }
    ],
    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: Two dogs are fighting for bones. sentence_B: Two dogs are sharing the bones they have.",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "One sentence says two dogs are fighting and the other says two dogs are sharing which is a contradiction but classified as entailment. So this is a wrong example."
        },
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: A dog is having fun with the toddler toys. sentence_B: The dog is enjoying with the toddler toys.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "Here having fun and playing are related to each other, so we can clearly there is entailment but classified as contradiction."
        },
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: The man is not eating breakfast because of meetings. sentence_B: The man is eating breakfast inspite of the meetings.",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "First sentence says man is not eating while the other one says man is eating, this is clearly a contradiction and hence 2 but is predicted as neutral wrongly."
