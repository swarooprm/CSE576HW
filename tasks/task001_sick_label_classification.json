        "Classification"
    ],
    "Definition": "This task is to classify correctly if the relation between the given two sentences A and B are entailed to or contradict each other.  Labels are given as entailment (0), neutral (1), or contradiction (2). Two sentences A and B entail each other if they are such that A is True then B requires to be True and if A is False then B must be false. In other words, the hypothesis is similar to that of the premise. If the hypothesis has a contradictory meaning then it is classified as a contradiction (2). If the hypothesis has the same lexical structure as the premise but not a similar meaning then we label it as neutral(0). The output would be either 1 or 0 or 2.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: A dancer is dancing on the stage. sentence_B: A girl is giving dance performance on the dais.",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "One sentence says, \"Dancing on the stage\" while the other sentence says, \"Dance performance on the dais\", which is clearly giving the same meaning and are related to each other. So the classification is entailment."
        },
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: The crowd is cheering at her dance performance. sentence_B: The group is enjoying while eating food.",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "The first one says, \"The crowd is cheering at dance performance\" whereas the second one says, \"Enjoying eating the food.\" There is no relation at all between the two sentences as it is neither supporting nor contradicting. So it is neutral."
        },
        {
            "input": "sentence_A: A man is standing and has tears of joy seeing the dance performance. sentence_B: There is no man standing with happiness seeing the dance.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "Here the first sentence says, \"A man is standing\", while the second sentence contradicts saying there is no man standing so clearly this is a contradiction so label 2."

    "Negative Examples": [

            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "One sentence says, \"Two dogs are fighting\" and the other says, \"Two dogs are sharing\" which is a contradiction but classified as entailment. So this is a wrong example."

            "input": "sentence_A: A dog is having fun with the toddler toys. sentence_B: The dog is enjoying with the toddler toys.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "Here having fun and playing are related to each other, so we can clearly say there is entailment but classified as a contradiction."
