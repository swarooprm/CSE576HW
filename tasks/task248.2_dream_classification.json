    "Definition": "In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into matching, summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense groups. Matching is a question entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in a dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. in arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".",

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man?

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

A pretty important role, Peter. What sort of protest would you organize? M: Well, recently we've been involved in anti-nuclear campaigns. I've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with. W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"? M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop. We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible. M: Well, people may think differently of your methods, but there's no doubt you're doing a great job. Keep it up and good luck.

This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting.

W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated.

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose.

And the Swedes makes most of it often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings.

W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated.

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay. Caller: And what's your name? Apartment Owner: It's Norman. Norman Bates. Caller: Alright, Mr. Bates. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

Brandon: So, but, I ... again, how do you know? Stacy: She's doing some of the same stuff, you know, um, like. Well, like. Listen, you know. Um, you've noticed she's been skipping work lately? Brandon: Well, she said she's been having some health problems, so I just figured it was that. Stacy: No, no, no. She's not. [ Are you sure? ] Yeah. It's, it's more than that. Like, a month ago, she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car. Brandon: Wow. Man. Um, I mean, she didn't tell me anything like that. I mean, her car is running fine, I think. Stacy: Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it. Brandon: And, I let her borrow my car a couple days ago, and I had fifty bucks in there, and when the car came back, it was gone. She's ... I don't know how else it could have disappeared. [ Man. I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it. Stacy: I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week. I saw her with the two cell phones, and when I checked the texts on the one phone .... Brandon: Wait, wait. Two phones? What do you mean? Stacy: ....Yeah, umm. Brandon: She only has one. Stacy: No, she's got at least two phones, and when I checked the one phone, I saw some texts, and she was talking about, um, um, some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them. Brandon: Ah, man. Stacy: I'm sorry, Brandon, um, I ... we need to, we need to confront her on this. You need to confront her on this. Brandon: I don't know how to do this. I mean ... yeah, I don't know. Stacy: I know, but you've got to. You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ... Brandon: But, she might blow up. Stacy: She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ... Brandon: I just don't know. Stacy: I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger. She's probably going to end up losing her job, she's probably going to get arrested, and she might even die. Brandon: Man, you're probably right. I have to think about this and how to approach her.

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay. Caller: And what's your name? Apartment Owner: It's Norman. Norman Bates. Caller: Alright, Mr. Bates. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

W: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago. M: That's a pretty long span of time. W: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\" M: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell? W: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size. M: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens? W: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?

Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"?

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What does the man think we should do now?

M: He was born in Indiana in 1931, but his parents moved to California when he was five. He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt. W: So how did he get into acting? M: Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting. W: Then when did his movie career really start? M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society. W: So how many more movies did he make? M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today? M: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies. Many young people saw him as a symbol of American youths., Question: What does the man say James Dean did at college in California? (A) He delivered public speeches. (B) He got seriously into acting.

In the first year we had to learn the basics, and then we had to take exams. W: Was it easy to find a job? M: I wrote to about six hotels and one of them gave me my first job, so I didn't have to wait too long. W: And what's the secret of being good at your job? M: Attention to detail. You have to love it. You have to show passion for it. W: And what are your plans for the future? M: I want to have my own place when the time is right., Question: What does Steve say about his job?

I'm playing a consultancy role, really. I've only been here in China a month, but I'm already on very good terms with my colleagues in the Department of Computer Science. Well, I'm happy that you could come. Do sit down, please. W: Dr. Francis, do you know I've got a chance to go to Cambridge in August? I wonder if you could tell me something about Britain. M: Certainly. Well, I was actually brought up in Scotland. Enn, in fact, I've never been to Cambridge. But well,.., yes, I'm sure I can give you some useful tips. Now, what do you want to know, Li Ming? W: Things like weather. What's the usual temperature there? M: Mmm, the temperature in Scotland is 22, or 23 degrees Centigrade, on average, I think. But Cambridge would be warmer, around 25, I would guess, because it's down south. W: Oh, that's nice. Do you know it is 34 here? Last year it reached 39. By the way, where do you think I should stay? M: Oh, that's important. You can, err,.., I suppose, stay in the college-owned flats, which are often near where you have your classes, and some are even on the campus. That would certainly be convenient. W: Yes, it would. M: But it can also be a disadvantage because you are, in a sense, separated from ordinary society. You're a language teacher, and I think learning from society is a valuable experience. W: Yes, yes, exactly, so what's the alternative? M: Maybe finding an English host family. I know of a student Ali from the Middle East. He told me that he had learnt a lot by staying with a British family. W: Thank you, I think it's quite a good suggestion. By the way, Dr. Francis, do you think I could...?, Question: What is the point Dr. Francis is making when he mentions Ali? (A) Certain things cannot be learned from books.

Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose.

Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you.

W: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago. M: That's a pretty long span of time. W: I know. That's what she said, though.

I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens? W: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases.

He came home yesterday and said he'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher, Miss Sanderson. She said he didn't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing, of course, and Michael was very embarrassed about it. Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress. W: She's engaged at the moment, I'm afraid. This is her secretary. M: I can hold on for a while if she's going to be free soon... W: I have a feeling she's going to be busy all morning, Mr. Holloway. She's at a Governors' meeting. It could go on for a very long time... M: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps you could help me. W: Of course. What form is Michael in? M: He's a first year. He's in 1B. His form teacher's Mr. Hopkins. W: And what kit should Michael have brought with him? M: Well that's the point. In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet, with black or blue plimsolls. So that's what we bought him. We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends. You know, Atlas Sports, West Street. W: I'm just looking at the information booklet, Mr. Holloway. There seems to have been some mistake. M: I thought so. Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson. W: What Michael came to school with was the senior girls' basketball kit. M: What? How on earth could that have happened? It says quite clearly in the booklet, black shorts and blue vest. I've got it in front of me. W: You're looking at the top of Page 11, aren't you? M: That's right. W: Well, unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading. If you look at the bottom of the previous page you'll see it says Boys' Kit in the left-hand column and Girls' Kit in the right-hand one, but when you turn over the page it's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren't repeated. M: So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque... W: I'm afraid so. M: Oh well. Anything for a quiet life, I suppose. Perhaps yon could ask Miss Sanderson to be patient for a week or so to give us time to buy the right kit. W: Of course. Goodbye Mr. Holloway., Question: What's Miss Sanderson? (A) A headmistress.

A pretty important role, Peter. What sort of protest would you organize? M: Well, recently we've been involved in anti-nuclear campaigns. I've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with. W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"? M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop. We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible. M: Well, people may think differently of your methods, but there's no doubt you're doing a great job. Keep it up and good luck.

Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay. Caller: And what's your name? Apartment Owner: It's Norman. Norman Bates. Caller: Alright, Mr. Bates. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Apartment Owner: Bye., Question: Under which circumstance could you lose your deposit according to the conversation? (A) You end the agreement before the minimum leasing period of four months. (B) You cause damage beyond normal use of the apartment. (C) You remove any of the furnishings without permission.",

M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?

A pretty important role, Peter. What sort of protest would you organize? M: Well, recently we've been involved in anti-nuclear campaigns. I've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with. W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by \"harass\"? M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop. We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible. M: Well, people may think differently of your methods, but there's no doubt you're doing a great job. Keep it up and good luck.

W: Then when did his movie career really start? M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society. W: So how many more movies did he make? M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today? M: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies.

Well, I'm happy that you could come. Do sit down, please. W: Dr. Francis, do you know I've got a chance to go to Cambridge in August? I wonder if you could tell me something about Britain.
