            "input": "The Benefits of a Weak Dollar Despite expressions to the contrary by politicos and economists, the nature of a weak dollar can actually benefit stagnated portions of our economy. For example, a weak U.S. dollar will actually help boost the manufacturing sector. A weak dollar can also help sell U.S. made goods in overseas markets at lower prices. A weak dollar will benefit a few European retailers who import Asian products bought for dollars and sell them in European markets for stronger euro payments. Or still too weak to give up the aggregate demand benefits of a weak dollar? It\u2019s obviously stronger than it has been, but it still isn\u2019t strong. Normally, the answer to the above question is easy if the dollar rises because of greater competitiveness and an improving international trade balance. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke has embraced a weak dollar policy. And he is not alone. The weak dollar mantra is very much in evidence on most of the boulevards and in the back alleys of Washington, D.C. The idea even has a certain appeal to the common man on the street. After all, a cheap dollar is advertised as an export stimulant and the fuel for an economic boom. The weak dollar is good for manufacturers in the U.S., whether they're the Big Three or German or whatever, because they can export at an advantage, says Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Edmunds.com. That advantage makes the U.S. a good place to manufacture goods, and that's after decades of manufacturing fleeing abroad. From the broad macro perspective, a stronger dollar benefits the domestic population by improving their terms of trade with the outside world. By that, economists mean we get more imports (the benefits of trade) per dollar of exports (the cost of trade). Much bad trade policy is based on the confusion over which is the cost of trade and which is the benefit. But a major reason for the strong dollar recently is the falling Euro, Japanese yen, Australian and Canadian dollars, etc. Weaker foreign currencies are the mirror image of a stronger dollar and shouldn\u2019t pose a problem. Net, net, a stronger dollar is likely a headwind in a weak economy. In a stronger, fully-employed economy, a rising dollar will still act as a headwind in that it reduces total effective demand, but the benefits to consumers in particular and the population generally will likely more than offset that negative. Weak Dollar? That's Good For U.S. Exports The dollar has been falling relative to other currencies, making buying imports more expensive in the U.S. On the other hand, it also means U.S. exports are more competitive around the world. That shift could be good news for U.S. manufacturers, especially the auto industry. Thanks to the Fed\u2019s weak dollar policy, the U.S. faces an inflation problem and so does the rest of the world. The weak dollar and the lack of \u201cflexibility\u201d \u2014 properly understood \u2014 also threaten the free flow of capital and the stability of the international monetary system. As with most things, a balance between a strong dollar and a weak dollar is the best for our economy and stock investors. Consumers pay reasonable prices for imported goods and our manufacturers can compete in the global marketplace.",

COPD is defined as a disability as it is an on going chronic illness. However for benefit purpose and other things they look more at how much it disables you and effects your daily living. Hope that helps your question The COPD Foundation reported that the disease causes the most days of lost productivity than any other chronic condition. Medical Requirements in the Blue Book. When the SSA receives an application for disability benefits, they evaluate it against a number of requirements. COPD can be found in Section 3.02\u2014Chronic pulmonary insufficiency, under Respiratory Disorders. In order to qualify for benefits, you must meet one of the following requirements: COPD, due to any cause, with a forced expiratory volume one (FEV1) that is equal to or lower to the minimum for your height, between 1.05 for those who are five feet and 1.65 or those who are six feet. Getting Disability Benefits for COPD. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a disability listing laying out the requirements for getting automatically approved for disability for various chronic respiratory disorders, including COPD. If you meet the requirements of this listing, you automatically qualify for benefits. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Social Security Disability COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a series of lung diseases that damages your lungs, blocking airflow and affecting your ability to breathe. The two most common conditions are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. A question I'm often asked is whether a person can get SSDI or SSI benefits for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is also called chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The answer to the question is this - if your COPD is severe enough, you can qualify for SSDI or SSI. COPD is a listing level disease, which means the SSA has laid out the criteria for it to be automatically considered a disability. This is important because if your COPD meets the requirements in the listing, then the SSA does not have to evaluate whether or not your COPD restrict your functional capacity to such a degree that you qualify for disability benefits. To see if you meet the listing criteria for COPD, read our article on the chronic pulmonary insufficiency listing. COPD - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - in this case Chronic mean 'long term' so yes, it is a disability. I have COPD Bronchiecstasis and I have a blue badge and it is a godsend as I can't walk very far at the moment but I am doing Pulmonary Rehab so here's hoping things will improve but it's hard work!

In this post, we\u2019ll break down the \u201cDoing Business As\u201d (DBA) to see if your business needs one. What Is a DBA? In the U.S., a DBA lets the public know who the real owner of a business is. The DBA is also called a Fictitious Business Name or Assumed Business Name. It got its origins as a form of consumer protection, so dishonest business owners can\u2019t try to avoid legal trouble by operating under a different name. In some cases, you don\u2019t need a DBA if your business name is a combination of your name and a description of your product or service. In this case, if my business was called Nellie Akalp\u2019s Gardening Service, I may not need a DBA. But, if it\u2019s just my first name (aka Nellie\u2019s Gardening Service), then a DBA is required. Some states require DBA or fictitious business name filings to be made for the protection of consumers conducting business with the entity. . A company is said to be doing business as when the name under which they operate their business differs from its legal, registered name. Some states require dba or fictitious business name filings to be made for the protection of consumers conducting business with the entity. If you're starting a sole proprietorship or a partnership, you have the option of choosing a business name or dba (doing business as) for your business. However, in cases of DBA, an individual does not use their own name as the company\u2019s legal name. For example, there is an individual named James Doe and he is the owner of a laundry service. He wants to call his laundry service \u201cGet\u2019m Clean Laundry\u201d.",

During a bowel movement, the muscles of the rectal wall contract to move stool from the rectum to the anus, a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body. The lower GI tract. Anatomic problems of the lower GI tract may involve parts of organs being in the wrong place, shaped abnormally, or incorrectly connected to other organs. Anatomic problems that affect the large intestine or anus include malrotation, volvulus, intussusception, fistula, imperforate anus, and colonic atresia. The ascending colon is the first of four sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm). These infections occur primarily in the large intestine (note some of these organisms can also infect the small intestine) and can invade the surrounding tissues. Invasion of the intestine can result in blood in the feces and cause an inflammatory response with significant numbers of fecal leukocytes. The small intestine is a long tube that connects the stomach to the large intestine. It folds many times to fit inside the abdomen. Enlarge The small intestine connects the stomach and the colon. It includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. There are five types of small intestine cancer. The types of cancer found in the small intestine are adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, carcinoid tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and lymphoma. This summary discusses adenocarcinoma and leiomyosarcoma (a type of sarcoma). The gastrointestinal tract is an organ system within humans and other animals which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces.

            "input": "In an effort to better understand how children form memories, the researchers asked 140 kids between the ages of 4 and 13 to describe their earliest memories and then asked them to do the same thing two years later. Conversely, a third of the children who were age 10 to 13 during the first interview described the same earliest memory during the second interview. More than half of the memories they recalled were the same at both interviews. The researchers are now studying why children remember certain events and not others. However, when the offset of childhood amnesia is defined as the age at which the majority of memories are personal recollections rather than known events, then offset occurs at approximately 4.5 years old. The development of memory in children becomes evident within the first 2 to 3 years of a child's life as they show considerable advances in declarative memory. This enhancement continues into adolescence with major developments in short term memory, working memory, long term memory and autobiographical memory. Most adults remember little before their third or fourth birthdays, and the thinking has been that prior to this age children do not have the cognitive or language skills to process and store events as memories. The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later. As this happens, memories occurring in the preschool years tend to be lost. \u201cAs young children get older their first memories tend to get later and later, but around age 10 their memories crystallize,\u201d Peterson tells WebMD. Childhood amnesia, also called infantile amnesia, is the inability of adults to retrieve episodic memories before the age of 2\u20134 years, as well as the period before age 10 of which adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time. In children under the age of 4, the memory storage capacity limitation constrains complex comprehension processes. As the child grows older however, less processing is necessary which opens more storage space for memory. Recent research on the development of memory has indicated that declarative, or explicit memory, may exist in infants who are even younger than two years old. For example, newborns who are less than 3 days old demonstrate a preference for their mother\u2019s own voice.",

Ex: community service, Big Brother program indeterminate sentence Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime. Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff. The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation. Each of these types of communities\u2014the geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; the community of care; and civil society\u2014may be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind of crime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded. The approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability. Inherent in many people\u2019s understanding of the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a \u2018dispute\u2019.

In addition to having sensory properties, a cat's whiskers are also a good indicator of his mood. When a cat is angry or feels defensive, the whiskers will be pulled back. Otherwise, when the cat is happy, curious or content, the whiskers will be more relaxed and pushed forward. But the whisker's primary use is to help a cat judge whether or not he'll fit through an opening. A cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as his body -- sort of a natural ruler. The whisker tips are sensitive to pressure. You'll probably see a cat stick his head in and out of an opening before he puts his body in. He's judging the width of the opening, and is determining if he can fit into it. Yes whiskers are used to help balance as well as feelers to help them judge space and help in the dark. A cats tail also helps them balance, my cat had lost his tail do to an \u2026 injury and now he uses his whiskers more to help balance.

A dog\u2019s whiskers are actually highly tuned, multi-functional, sensitive sensory hairs they need and use every day to perform specific functions that help them move around in their world. Dog whiskers are found on both sides of their muzzle, as well as on the forehead above the eyes, on their chin and above the upper lip. Whiskers are rooted very deep in the cat's face, in an area rich in nerves and blood vessels. In addition to having the long tactile hairs on their cheeks, cats also have shorter ones above their eyebrows, on their chin and on the back of their front legs. As puppies grow, the whiskers are among the first hairs to develop. Unlike the neatly arranged 12 whiskers in four rows on each side of a cat\u2019s face, dog whiskers are more varied in their pattern depending on their breed and genetics. Whiskers are twice as thick and coarser than regular dog hair. Do cats use their whiskers for balance? Yes the whiskers help them balance as well as the tail.

And better students too. Through this course I hope to help you better understand the massive world of information. Information literacy is the ability to think critically about information. It is a fundamental part of critical inquiry in the Information Age. The information literate student can: 1. Determine the extent of information he or she needs. The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy defined information literacy as a set of skills, which require an individual to: \u201crecognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.\u201d(2) Information literacy is the ability to think critically about information. It is a fundamental part of critical inquiry in the Information Age. Although the term \u00b4information literacy\u00b4 is spreading throughout the library literature today, it is not a new idea. \u201cInformation literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning. It is common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of education. It enables learners to master content and extend their investigations, become more self-directed, and assume greater control over their own learning.\u201d(1) Information literacy is the ability to discover and use various types of information. It's an essential skill for navigating the information age. Watch this course to learn about strategies for finding information\u2014from a library, archive, database, or the Internet\u2014and the ethics of using it. Information literacy is the ability to think critically about information. It is a fundamental part of critical inquiry in the Information Age. The information literate student can: 1. 1  Determine the extent of information he or she needs.  Access the needed information effectively and efficiently. If a student has learned how to learn, upon graduation, they are a much more attractive job candidate. An information literate individual--with their strong analytical, critical thinking and problem-solving skills--can be expected to be an adaptable, capable and valuable employee, with much to contribute. Other characteristics of an information literate individual include the spirit of inquiry and perseverance to find out what is necessary to get the job done. We live in the Information Age, and information is increasing at a rapid pace. We have the Internet, television, radio, and other information resources available to us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, just because so much information is so easily and quickly available does not mean that all of it is worthwhile or even true.",

Distance of the teeth need to be moved- The amount of space or distance that is required to move the teeth can also determine the average length of time to wear braces. If one has a minor orthodontic problem and the teeth have to travel only a narrow distance, then one may have shorter time duration for treatment. The average length of time to wear braces can vary from one individual to another. Depending on the condition of the teeth and gums, the space available, the severity of the misaligned teeth, the distance which the teeth needs to cover and the cooperativeness of the individual to instructions. However, the average length of time to wear braces is usually from 1 to 2 years. For some individuals braces may have to be worn for longer period of time up to 3 years or so and for some other individuals the time duration to wear braces may be lesser.

These four steps are the best and easiest ways to help you remember how to care for your mouth, teeth and gums: Brush at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes, especially first thing in the morning and before bedtime. Use the tip of the brush to reach behind each front tooth on the top and bottom. In addition, don't forget flossing - it's just as important as brushing. If you don't brush your teeth long enough, you may not be getting your teeth clean enough. If you leave behind bacteria on the teeth after brushing, it can lead to serious problems such as gingivitis or periodontitis. Though it is important to pay attention to how long you're brushing, it's even more important to make sure all surfaces are clean. Remember to brush using short strokes, moving back and forth against the teeth and gums, around the surface of every tooth. In fact, according to the Delta Dental survey, people who brush at least twice a day are 22 percent more likely to describe their oral health as good or better compared with those who brush less frequently.

I'm not sure how to measure for a gc2b binder! it's my first binder and i'm very scared to mess this up! photos or guides would be super appreciated. 3 comments. SIZE OF YOUR BINDER- The size of our binder depends on your sheet size. Binder size is always. measured by the size sheet the binder will hold. Most binders are made to hold 11\u201d x 8 1/2\u201d or. 8 1/2\u201d x 5 1/2\u201d sheets. Always list the binding edge of your sheet first. D-Ring Binders hold up to 25% more paper than a Round Ring. The ring is mounted to the back cover so pages lie flat. The number of pages of paper (sheet capacity) that a binder can hold depends on the size of the binder (that\u2019s the ring size measured as inches) and the type of ring style. Measure around your chest just below the swell of your breast. Make certain the measuring tape is snug, but not constricting. This measurement is your underbust, as shown by the red line in the diagram. Now measure around the fullest part of your breast. The tape should be loose-fitting, as when measuring for a bra. This number is your topbust. Subtract your underbust size from your topbust size. This number will give you your cupsize, according to the chart below. 6. sohoeva: Every binder at this site has a different size chart. Pick the binder you want, then click on the size chart. You\u2019ll find the button to get to the chart down near the bottom of the page, where there are other pictures of the binder for you to click on and enlarge. One of those pictures is the size chart. For example: 5 tabs = 20 sheets, which would be deducted from the above total number of sheets. For larger binders, you can approximate the number of sheets by calculating from the totals above. For example, a 2 binder can hold up to 500 sheets of 24# bond, and a 1 binder can hold 250 sheets. Therefore, a 3 binder would be needed to hold up to 750 sheets. Ring binder size (1\u2033, 2\u2033, etc.) is measured based on the size of the ring, not the width of the binder spine. The overall size of the rings must be larger than the stated inch-size because the ring must go around the contents in order for you to close it. Round Ring (also called O-Ring) your binder: Measure along the straight edge of the ring, as indicated by the red arrow. Do not include any of the curved part of the ring.

Jul 22, 2012, 1:07 AM. It is my understanding that Business Select, and A list rapid rewards people are automatically AHEAD of early bird people. So, if there are a lot of them on the flight--you are pushed back. All customers are subject to physical search at the security checkpoint. Random physical searches of customers, either through use of wands or pat down methods at the security checkpoint, will be ongoing. Early Bird Check-In passengers board after Business Select and A-List Customers. There are several ways to purchase the early check-in, including online, over the phone through a reservation agent or through the Southwest mobile app. When I purchased my ticket and early bird check-in in late March for a mid-July domestic flight on Southwest, common sense made me think that my purchased boarding position ($10 for each of the two flights) would reflex the early purchase date and be related to an early bird process. Am I correct in assuming that Southwest Airlines puts your name/confirmation number in a hat and pulls it out along with all the other people who also paid for the early bird check-in to determine your boarding pass location? Upon inquiring at the check-in kiosk, Southwest personnel were not surprised and commented that sometimes early bird check-in can result in a C boarding position (an additional 60 positions farther back in boarding). For a small fee, Southwest Airlines' Early Bird Check-In allows passengers to check-in to a flight automatically up to 36 hours prior to the flight's scheduled departure time. While not guaranteed, most Early Bird Check-In passengers obtain an A boarding pass, which allows them to board the plane earlier than most passengers. Check in online. Check in online and print your boarding pass beginning 24 hours in advance of departure. You will need your airline confirmation number (or PNR) and first and last name to retrieve your reservation. What to expect at the airport and while boarding the plane.",

There are many different types of triglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types. Saturated fats are saturated A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three to four fatty acids (from tri-and glyceride). Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils. For adults, triglyceride test results are categorized as follows: 1  Desirable: Less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) 2  Borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.7-2.2 mmol/L) 3  High: 200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L) 4  Very high: Greater than 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) Triglycerides. 1  Blood tests for triglycerides are usually part of a lipid profile that is used to help identify an individual's risk of developing heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be needed if there is borderline or high risk. Testing may be ordered more frequently when people have identified risk factors for heart disease. 1  Some risk factors for heart disease include: 2  Cigarette smoking. 3  Being overweight or obese. 4  Unhealthy diet. 5  Being physically inactive\u2014not getting enough exercise. 6  Age (men 45 years or older or women 55 years or older) Ranges with anything over 499 are being considered extremely high. But these numbers serve more as just a measurement method. They are used to assess risk. Most people wondering what are triglycerides also want to know what having elevated triglycerides levels can mean for the body. Atherosclerosis is the biggest risk associated with having high triglycerides levels. Sometimes, this storage comes in the form of excess fat in the midsection. Figuring out just what are triglycerides means understanding where they come from. In most cases, triglycerides are the result of digestion and the body breaking down fats. Sometimes they also are the byproduct of carbohydrates as well. While the fats are not always a bad thing, having triglycerides too high can be and for a multitude of reasons. What Are Triglycerides Levels and Why Do They Matter? When most people ask what are triglycerides, it is because they associate the word with being bad for the body. In fact, they are incredibly important to many body processes and are considered the main form of fat within the body. The body uses triglycerides for energy, which is a good thing. A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids (from tri- and glyceride). Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils. Triglycerides are utilized in the body by offering a source of energy to cells that require it. They are a normal component of the blood and are naturally stored in fat deposits. However, when present in excess triglycerides can cause problems in the body and lead to serious diseases.",

The tri-shield insignia with distinctive, diagonally arranged red, white and blue shields, was widely introduced in 1960 and was featured front-and-center in the grilles of the LeSabre, Electra and Invicta models. The three-model lineup inspired the three shields in the new design. Each carried over the stag head and gold cross cues from the previous single-shield design. As with the original shield design, the tri-shield design evolved. By the early 1970s, a ring motif surrounded the shields and the white color of one of the shields changed to silver. By the late 1970s, the tri-shield was used primarily on hood ornaments on some models, while the symbol of a hawk on the Buick name was used as the official logo, particularly in print and television advertising.",

Cooking Sweet Potatoes<br /><i><b></b></i><i><b>Our sweet potato cooks give some advice:</b></i><ul><li>I usually bake a small- to medium-sized sweet potato for 40 minutes in a 350-degree oven. I usually pierce it once or twice with a fork and put foil under it while it cooks. Baking potatoes requires a temperature range between 300 and 400F, depending upon the type of oven you use. Medium size potatoes will have to be baked for 45 minutes at 400F or for 60 minutes at 350F or 90 minutes at 325F in a regular oven. If you use convection ovens, you will have to bake the potatoes for 45 minutes at 375F or 60 minutes at 325F or 90 minutes at 300F. Convection ovens cook faster than regular ovens so the rule of thumb is to set the temperature in convection ovens at least 25F lower than you would set in a regular oven. The higher the baking temperature, the lesser the time required for baking. Baking time also depends on the size of the potatoes. Be sure the foil is well-sealed. Place on a baking sheet and put them into the oven to roast. 4. Check for doneness: Depending on the size of your potatoes, it may take between 30 minutes to 1 hour for them to be done. Check at 30 minutes by squeezing one of the potatoes in a oven mitt protected hand and inserting a sharp knife or fork into the center. They should feel quite soft and the knife should easily glide all the way through. If not return to the oven and check again in 10 minutes. 5.",

This is the head of the femur ligament. Subtrochanteric fractures are located between the lesser trochanter and the femoral isthmus that is, in the proximal part of the femoral shaft. They are less common than femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures, accounting for approximately 5% to 15 % of hip fractures. Now, the acetabulum, as I mentioned, is a cavity formed by the synostosis of these three bones. So this is the meeting point of these three bones: the ilium, the pubic bone, and of course, the ischium. Now, still on the acetabulum, I want to add something important here that this is the socket for the hip joint. Femoral Neck Fractures The femoral neck is the most common location for a hip fracture, accounting for 45% to 53% of hip fractures. Per 100,000 person years, approximately 27.7 femoral neck fractures occur in men and 63.3 occur in women. Part Position of the Lateral Femur distal and mid shaft. Pt. is in lateral recumbent position. Flex knee 45* with patient on affected side and align femur to midline of IR, placing unaffected leg behind affected, to prevent rotation. Include knee joint and take a 2nd radiograph for the hip. As you know, the hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint, and for that matter, you\u2019re going to have a ball portion. That is the head of the femur as you can see here. And of course, the socket portion where this head will attach will, then, be the acetabulum. Now, moving on to another part, the largest portion of the femur, this is known, of course, as the body or the shaft of the femur. Moving on to the next one, this time, we\u2019re going to talk about the neck of the femur. And this is the portion that you find between the head right here and this other portion that we\u2019re going to talk about next known as the greater trochanter. Now, on the posterior side, you find, as well, another line, let\u2019s say, but this time called the intertrochanteric crest that is also between the neck of the femur and the shaft and runs, as well, from the greater trochanter all the way down to the lesser trochanter. The femoral neck is the region of the femur bounded by the femoral head proximally and the greater and lesser trochanters distally (shown below). A femoral neck fracture is intracapsular, that is within the hip joint and beneath the fibrous joint capsule. And the very first thing you need to know about the hip bone, it\u2019s also comprised of three bones. Three bones... or the hip bone consists of three bones. The first one is this one that you can see here. It\u2019s highlighted in green like all our training units and all our tutorials.",

Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) consumes a lot of very coarse grasses that other kinds of zebras and equines are not able to digest properly, due to the severe toughness. The bulk of the Grevy's zebra diet consists of these fibrous, tougher-textured grasses, along with forbs. In the process we will clarify what the reason is they have stripes as well as 1  : what type of social structures they have, 2  why they can afford to be unselective grazers (i.e. not too fussy about what they eat), 3  what enemies they have in nature and what defense mechanisms they use for protection, Other Forms of Sustenance. Although grass certainly makes up the bulk of a zebra's menu, they do occasionally eat other things. Other types of zebra foods include fruit, buds, roots, herbs, shoots and shrubs. The zebra\u2019s main predator or natural enemy is the lion. But other creatures attack, kill and eat zebras as well. Huge crocodiles often catch zebras when they are swimming across African rivers.

Animal Life, General Knowledge. Zebras are mammals that belong to the horse family. They are black creatures with white strips. Each zebra has a unique stripe pattern. Despite being closely related to the horse, attempts to make zebras ride-able have proved fruitless courtesy of their unpredictable nature. Zebras in Zoos. On another hand, some zebras are under human control in places such as the zoo. These zebras apparently eat better than their wild counterparts, which is completely understandable. Zebras in zoos eat pallets specially made for herbivores, which supply them with more nutrients than hay. Grass is the basic diet of mountain and plain zebras. It forms about 92% of their overall diets. They eat red grass, Bermuda grass that they find along the riverbeds and short grasses like common finger. Zebras also eat herbs and shrubs which constitute about 5% and 2% of their diet plan respectively. The Burchell's zebra prefer open woodland, scrub and grassland. They will avoid dense vegetation. They are very dependent on water and you will seldom see them more than 12 km from it. The Cape mountain specie prefers the mountainous areas of the Eastern and Western Cape in Southern Africa. The Feeding Habit. The feeding habit of zebras is a bit complex. Zebras are basically herbivores. They eat plain grass, shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves, roots and bark from trees.",

Rinse the fish and pat it dry with clean paper towels. Grease a baking dish with a nonstick cooking spray and lay the speckled trout in the middle of the dish. The spray will help prevent the fish from sticking to the dish and make removal of the fish easier when cooking is complete. Step 4. Brush the fish with a mixture of butter, thyme, rosemary, black pepper and tarragon. If cooking in an oven, pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. After you have rolled up the trout, you have to measure its thickness. Cook for 10 minutes plus an extra 10 minutes for each inch of thickness. If you stuff a 4-pound trout, it will be about 3 inches thick so you would cook it for 40 minutes.

Its main functions are: It supports the cell and maintains shape. It controls the positions and movements of organelles within the cell. Some freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles, a specialized form of vacuole that they use to manage water balance within the cell by pumping out excess water. Plant cells have very large vacuoles which function in storing nutrients and water within the cell. They can also serve a structural function by helping the plant cell to retain its shape through turgidity. Vesicles typically function through transportation of compounds within and between cells. Often, the substances within a vesicle will be cellular products or byproducts of a cells functioning. Typically vesicles function in much the same way in all cells. Vacuoles serve a variety of functions depending on the cell in which they are found. In most animal cells where vacuoles occur, they function in the temporary storage of food substances. Do white blood cells have vacuoles or vesicles? White blood cells have vesicles, which transport molecules in and out of the cell. It is plant cells which have the vacuoles which maintains cell stability. outside of the cell wall (endocytosis). 3. Enzyme Storage: Vesicles can hold and store enzymes used throughout the cell. e.g. enzymes that are used to make plant cell walls. 2. Metabolism: Vesicles can act as chemical reaction chambers. The membrane of vesicles harbor reactions from the cytosol in the cell allowing the reactions to take place. In a plant cell the vacuole is much larger than the animal cells vacuole. The plant cells vacuole mostly contains water. In the animal cells vacuole it is used to store waste. \u2026 Animal cells do not have vacuoles. Only plant cells Vesicles and Vacuoles Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles, and the membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components. Vesicles can fuse with other membranes within the cell system (Figure 1). The contractile vacuole enlarges as water enters then abruptly contracts, forcing the water out of the cell through a special pore structure. Vacuoles work with the cell membrane to move materials in and out of the cell. They also work with the lysosomes of a cell to digest cellular materials. Vesicle Vacuoles are basically vesicles filled with mostly water. A vesicle is a small bubble in a cell. This bubble is similar to a plasma membrane, consisting of a lipid bi-layer. 2. Structure: In many plant cells, enormous vacuoles take up more than 90 percent of the cell volume and grow as the cell grows. The presence of dissolved substances in the vacuole causes water to enter it from the cytoplasm, making the vacuole swell like a water-filled balloon. The contractile vacuole enlarges as water enters then abruptly contracts, forcing the water out of the cell through a special pore structure.

While most of the earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, several non-silicate minerals are of great importance. Silicates constitute the majority of Earth's crust, as well as the other terrestrial planets, rocky moons, and asteroids. Sand, Portland cement, and thousands of minerals are examples of silicates. Silicate compounds, including the minerals, consist of silicate anions whose charge is balanced by various cations. For anion, see Orthosilicate (ion). Silicate minerals are rock-forming minerals made up of silicate groups. They are the largest and most important class of rock-forming minerals and make up approximately 90 percent of the Earth's crust. They are classified based on the structure of their silicate groups, which contain different ratios of silicon and oxygen. A silicate is a compound containing an anionic silicon compound. The great majority of the silicates are oxides, but hexafluorosilicate ([SiF6]2\u2212) and other anions are also included. Orthosilicate is the anion SiO4\u2212. While most minerals are silicates, many non-silicate minerals are found in the earth's crust and are important as well. This lesson will use examples and describe the three major groups of non-silicate minerals, including carbonates, halides and sulfates. The main minerals found in many rocks.

Let's assume that at this location on the Earth, the magnetic field is pointing directly North with a horizontal component of about 2 x 10-5 T. Now suppose that I do something to create a magnetic field in a known direction and perpendicular to the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field. The field has always been losing energy despite its variations, so it cannot be more than 10,000 years old. We now have simple explanations for the field's origin, history, and present state. In this light, the earth's magnetic field is no longer a mystery; it is a testimony of God's handiwork. Earth's present-day magnetic field is, in fact, much stronger than normal. The dipole moment, a measure of the intensity of the magnetic field, is now 8 x 1022 amps x m2. That's twice the million-year average of 4 x 1022 amps x m2. of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field at the specific location in which the experiment took place. An Earth inductor is used to perform the various components of the experiment. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The Dynamo theory proposes that these movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas (0.25 to 0.65 gauss). Best Answer: No, it changes all the time. The magnetic poles, the points at which the earth's magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface, are always on the move ... Magnetic fields. 1  Magnetic fields arise from current flows. 2  Their strength is measured in amperes per meter (A/m). Commonly, EMF investigators use a related measure, flux density (in microtesla (\u00b5T) or millitesla (mT) instead. 3  Magnetic fields exist as soon as a device is switched on and current flows. \u2018As further evidence, I used the authoritative International Geomagnetic Reference Field data\u2014more than 2500 numbers representing the earth\u2019s magnetic field over the whole twentieth century.

The concept of Western betrayal refers to the view that the United Kingdom and France failed to meet their legal, diplomatic, military and moral obligations with respect to the Czech and Polish nations during the prelude to and aftermath of the Second World War. The Tuvan People's Republic, was proclaimed independent in 1921 and was a satellite state of Soviet Union until its annexation in 1944 by the Soviet Union. Another early Soviet satellite state in Asia was the short-lived Far East Republic in Siberia. Post-World War II Satellite state. The term satellite state designates a country that is formally independent in the world, but under heavy political, economic and military influence or control from another country. The term was coined by analogy to planetary objects orbiting a larger object, such as smaller moons revolving around larger planets, and is used mainly to refer to Central and Eastern European countries of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War or to Mongolia or Tannu Tuva between 1924 and 1990, for example.

An interview with Anne Applebaum about her new book, The Crushing of Eastern Europe. Soviet-built tanks wheel into action in a smoke-filled Budapest street during Hungary's rebellion against communist satellite government in October of 1956. They therefore,if anything, tightened their grip, Hungary 1956,Czechoslovakia 1968 and the construction of the Berlin Wall all being examples.After Stalin,it wasn't so much the desire to extend Soviet power as paranoia about losing it that maintained Soviet desire to control Eastern Europe. There are 3 main reasons why Stalin wanted to control Eastern Europe. 1.) Russia has historically no secure border. 2.) They wanted to set up satellite countries. 3.) Why did the United Nations send troops to Korea in 1950? They wanted to contain and push back the communist invaders from the North. Why was the Arab-Israeli conflict considered part of the Cold War? On top of that, Russia had been the victim of attacks from the west multiple times. In 1914 and 1941 Germany attacked Russia through Poland. To Stalin, the past was a reliable indicator of what the future could hold. Stalin thought that having control over eastern europe could significantly undermine this threat. Despite this, it was agreed at the Yalta conference, with the consent of Stalin, that all the countries liberated from Nazi Germany would have the right to be democratic and politically independent. Not just Eastern Europe, Stalin wanted to control the world by creating an empire based on Communism. That's how they clashed with US who intended to control the world by building an empire based on Capitalism. That's what the Cold War is about.",

A: A study on external root resorption in the journal Schweiz Monatsschr Zahnmed states that trauma, periodontitis, orthodontic treatment, internal bleaching, cysts, tumors or stimuli from a necrotic dental pulp may cause tooth root resorption. Over time, all areas of an affected tooth, from root to crown, may become involved. Tooth resorption is a common condition, affecting an estimated 20 percent to 60 percent of all cats and close to three-quarters of those five years of age and older. The unerupted tooth. An unerupted tooth can exert pressure against a neighboring root, to cause resorption similar to that from orthodontic treatment. Typical examples include the forward-leaning lower wisdom tooth which is impacted against the back of the standing second molar and causes damage where the two meet. In a condition known as a tooth resorption \u2013formerly referred to as feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion (FORL) or cervical line lesion\u2014the dentin in a single tooth (or several simultaneously) erodes and eventually becomes irreparably destroyed. What Is \u201cTooth Resorption\u201d? Tooth resorption is loss of hard dental tissue, but not from decay. This means that the substance of a tooth is broken down by certain specialised body cells and then absorbed. Resorption thus causes some of a tooth, generally in the root area, to just disappear. In the developing child there is a natural physiological resorption of the roots to allow for the exfoliation, or shedding of the first set of teeth at the appropriate time. (Redirected from Root resorption) Tooth resorption is a process by which all or part of a tooth structure is lost due to activation of the body's innate capacity to remove mineralized tissue, as mediated via cells such as osteoclasts. Types include external resorption and internal resorption. It can be due to trauma, infection, or hyperplasia. Within each of a cat\u2019s teeth is a chamber (root canal) that contains tissue made up of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. This tissue, which communicates with the rest of the animal\u2019s body, is surrounded by a bony substance called dentin, which accounts for the bulk of the tooth\u2019s structure. The best way of confirming the suspected presence of the condition, she notes, is by means of a full-mouth intra-oral radiograph. If veterinary examination reveals the presence of tooth resorption, Dr. Rawlinson points out, the only effective treatment will entail extraction of any affected teeth. El-Bialy states that orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption differs from other types of tooth root resorption, and treatment protocol for this type always involves a root canal treatment or extraction of these teeth in severe cases and prosthetic replacement. Everyday Health indicates that the majority of patients who go through orthodontic therapy do not get root resorption. Everyday Health also explains that many teeth with root resorption still function properly and may last for many years or even a lifetime despite resorption.",

However, there are safety concerns that come with nuclear power, including the possibility that a nuclear power plant could accidentally release radiation into the environment or be targeted for a terrorist attack. There is also the issue of what to do with radioactive waste.In this lesson, we will explore the risks associated with nuclear power and discuss how radioactive waste is handled. Most nuclear reactors are based on the concept of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission occurs when uranium nuclei are bombarded with neutrons.he isotope U-235 is important because it can be used in the nuclear fission chain reaction to create a lot of energy. Unlike the uranium used in a nuclear bomb, which is about 90% enriched with the isotope U-235, the uranium used in a nuclear reactor is only slightly enriched, to about four or five percent.

When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved. Convergent boundary. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide. Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater (Iceland is an exception) and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges. There are basically three different types of plate boundaries (divergent, convergent, transform), and a fourth type (boundary zones) is sometimes designated when it is difficult to define a clear boundary: 1  Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust. Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Superheated molten lava, about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, is about to explode into the water at the West Mata volcano along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Deep trenches are often formed where tectonic plates are being subducted and earthquakes are common. As the sinking plate moves deeper into the mantle, fluids are released from the rock causing the overlying mantle to partially melt. Shane Shurock and Barret Dolan Effects: The effects are deep earthquakes, an oceanic trench, a chain of volcanic islands, and the annihilation of oceanic lithosphere. The Pacific and Caroline plates form s volcanic islands and trenches. The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary. These island arcs are always landward of the neighboring trenches. When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary. 1 Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. 2  Convergent boundaries -- where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. 3  Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other.",

In order to cause rust quickly, there must be some impurities in the water,... Rusty Nail and Tetanus It is commonly advised that people should avoid rusty nails because they are dangerous. One of the most common beliefs is that piercing the skin with a rusty nail can cause you to develop tetanus or lockjaw. Tetanus is referred to as lockjaw because the initial symptoms of the disease will cause the muscles around the mouth to become rigid. If you take an iron nail and let it rust in air, you'll find that the weight of the rusted nail is larger than that of the nail before it rusted. This gives the impression that the amount of mass hasn't remained constant, but what has really happened is that the oxygen in the air (which you didn't weigh) combined with the iron to make it rust. As a result, the weight of the oxygen plus the weight of the iron is equal to the weight of the rust that's formed. OK. A: Nails rust in water because water allows the iron to react with any oxygen present, which forms iron oxide, known as rust. In order to cause rust quickly, there must be some impurities in the water, particularly salts, since these speed up the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen. It is possible to contract tetanus if you are cut by a rusty nail. Tetanus is caused by the clostridium tetani bacteria which are commonly found in dust, soil and animal feces. Because these items are commonly found around areas like gardens or work sites where rusty nails are present, the general belief that rusty nails cause tetanus was born. It is important to note that it is not so much the rust on the nail that causes people to contract tetanus, but the fact that nails can cause deep wounds that make it easier for the tetanus infection to spread.

Femoral nerve block with local anesthetic and steroid is occasionally used in the treatment of persistent lower extremity pain when the pain is thought to be secondary to inflammation or when entrapment of the femoral nerve as it passes under the inguinal ligament is suspected. The femoral artery is a very large artery that lies close to the femoral nerve. In trauma they are often injured together. Injury to or bleeding in the artery can cause compression on the nerve. Additionally, because the femoral nerve provides sensation to a major portion of the leg, injuries can occur due to this loss of sensation. In the thigh, the nerve lies in a groove between iliacus muscle and psoas major muscles, outside the femoral sheath, and lateral to the femoral artery. After a short course of about 4 cm in the thigh, the nerve is divided into anterior and posterior divisions, separated by lateral femoral circumflex artery. Mononeuritis multiplex is the femoral nerve dysfunction due to systemic disorder of femoral nerve. Entrapment of femoral nerve also damages myelin sheath or axons (nerve fibers). Due to this the impulses are not passed on properly via nerve. If pelvic bone is broken, femoral nerve can get damaged. The femoral nerve is present in leg and provides assistance in the leg straightening action. Sensation to the thigh front and lower leg is provided by femoral nerve. Pelvic fracture is the major problem associated with this nerve. In case the femoral nerve is damaged, it is indicated by weakness in leg or impaired movement or sensation of leg. Recovery is possible if the exact reason for femoral nerve dysfunction is diagnosed.",

Salpingectomy for Ovarian Cancer Prevention. ABSTRACT: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate out of all types of gynecologic cancer and is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Salpingectomy is the surgical removal of one or both fallopian tubes. The fallopian tubes serve as a passageway for an ovum to travel from the ovary to the uterus. In a unilateral salpingectomy, only one fallopian tube is removed; in a bilateral salpingectomy, both fallopian tubes are removed. A salpingectomy can be performed for a number of reasons, including treatment of ectopic pregnancies and infections in the fallopian tubes (salpingitis). In our opinion, introduction of bilateral salpingectomies at the time of tubal ligation or hysterectomy for benign gynecologic patients is a reasonable option. In the absence of good screening tests, this procedure is the only form of prophylaxis for a cancer that is difficult to detect and often lethal when found. Physicians should at least present patients with this option during presterilization and prehysterectomy counseling. Light Work usually requires walking or standing to a significant degree.

First, understand that the award letter you receive from FAFSA is an estimate. You will receive your estimated award letter 6-8 weeks after submitting your application. This estimate indicates what you are eligible for, based on the information you provided, not your actual FAFSA money. FAFSA may indicate that you are eligible for a Pell grant in a certain amount, for example. Your financial aid award is determined by the school you will be attending and their financial aid offices. While FAFSA could estimate $2,000 per semester for the above-mentioned grant, your university may only approve $1,500 of this. The same principle applies to all other government grants and loans. In turn, you will receive another document, this time from your university\u2019s financial aid office, which outlines what you will receive in aid, should you accept it.

Your official EFC is generated when you apply for the Pell Grant via the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA; learn more about how to submit a FAFSA here. For the 2015-2016 academic year, your EFC must be at or below $5081 to qualify for the Pell. I'll go over how to estimate your eligibility in the next section. Your enrollment status (full-time versus part-time) will also affect how much Pell Grant money you're eligible for - full-time students will get more aid than part-time students. Award. 1  Maximum award is $5,815 per academic year; maximum award per semester is $2,908. 2  Students who received their maximum Pell Grant awards in the fall and spring, will not receive a Pell Grant in the summer. This means you very likely will receive a $1570 Pell Grant for the full year...and $5500 as a Direct Loan. Those are the only guaranteed forms of federally funded aid you will receive. You MIGHT get other grants or scholarships...and you MIGHT get Work Study. Your eligibility depends on your Expected Family Contribution, your year in school, your enrollment status, and the cost of attendance at the school you will be attending. The financial aid office at your college or career school will determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive. Site Last Updated: Saturday, July 1, 2017.

In a unanimous opinion, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed the challenge of a group of county judges to the mandatory retirement age (70) for judges in Pennsylvania. It takes two successive sessions before an amendment to the constitution goes before the citizens of Pennsylvania for a vote. Right now the bill, which would raise the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75 is in its second session. June 17, 2013 | By Peter Hall, Of The Morning Call. Judges who challenged the Pennsylvania Constitution's mandatory retirement age should pursue an amendment to eliminate it, the state Supreme Court said Monday in throwing out their case. The state Supreme Court Monday found that judges challenging Pennsylvania's mandatory retirement age had no legitimate claim and instead said that the proper way to change it is through constitutional amendment. Judges who challenged the Pennsylvania Constitution's mandatory retirement age should pursue an amendment to eliminate it, the state Supreme Court said Monday in throwing out their case. In 1968, when the mandatory retirement age was placed in the constitution, life expectancy was 70, and today it is 78, said Sen. Lisa Boscola, D-Northampton County. Pennsylvania is one of 33 states with a mandatory retirement age, typically varying from 70 to 75. HARRISBURG \u2014 The state Senate on Tuesday took a major step toward raising the mandatory retirement age for justices and judges from 70 to 75, approving a House-passed bill to change the state Constitution.

            "input": "Bremsstrahlung (or Brems) radiation. is one of the two kinds of x-rays produced at the tungsten target of the x-ray tube; The incident high-speed electron, passing through a tungsten atom, is attracted by the positively charged nucleus and therefore is deflected from its course, with a resulting loss of energy. High-energy x-. ray photons have a greater probability of penetrating matter, whereas relatively low-energy photons have a greater probability of being absorbed. Therefore the higher the kVp and mean energy of the x-ray beam, the greater the penetrability of the beam through matter. X-rays can be produced by a high-speed collision between an electron and a proton. Light can take on many forms. Radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation are all different forms of light. The energy of the photon tells what kind of light it is. Radio waves are composed of low energy photons. Optical photons--the only photons perceived by the human eye--are a million times more energetic than the typical radio photon. This results in an increased efficiency of conversion of electron energy into x-ray photons, and thus an increase in 1) BThe number of photons generated ~ Be eww aa rre iinn BBooardd EExxaammss 2) Their mean energy. 3) Their maximal energy. The x-ray photons are either absorbed or scattered out of the beam. In scattering, photons are ejected out of the primary beam as a result of interactions with the orbital electrons of absorber atoms. In the case of a dental x-ray beam, three mechanisms exist where these interactions take place. In radiation protection, the product of absorbed dose and the correct modifying factor (rad x QF) is used to determine. rem (Sv) Rem (dose-equivalent) is the only unit of measurement that expresses the dose-effect relationship. The product of rad (absorbed dose) and the quality factor appropriate for the radiation type is expressed as rem or DE (dose equivalent), and may be used to predict the type and extent of response to radiation. classical scatter, a low-energy photon interacts with an atom but causes no ionization; the incident photon disappears into the atom, and is then immediately released as a photon of identical energy but changed direction. X-Rays-Another Form of Light. The photons themselves can also collide with electrons. If the electrons have more energy than the photons, the collision can boost the energy of the photons. In this way, photons can be changed from low-energy photons to high-energy photons. The closer the high-speed electron approaches the nuclei, the greater is the electrostatic attraction on the electron, the braking effect, and the greater the energy of the resulting Bremsstrahlung photon. Bremsstrahlung interactions generate x-ray photons with a continuous spectrum of energy. i.e. different energies. The HVL is the thickness of an absorber, such as aluminum, required to reduce by one half the number of x-ray photons passing through it. As the average energy of an x-ray beam increases, so does it HVL. The term quality refers to the mean energy of an x-ray beam. Half value layer measures the intensity of a beam.",
