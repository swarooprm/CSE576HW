    "Definition": "#Given the prompt and a #response, #classify the them to \"yes\" if #response is \"yes, and\" type. Otherwise #classify it as \"no\". \"##Yes, and\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that #suggests that a #participant in a #dialogue should accept what another #participant has stated (\"##Yes\") and then expand on that #line of thought or context (\"and...\"). 1 In short, a \"##Yes, and\" is a #dialogue #exchange in which a speaker #responds by adding new #information on top of the ##information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. #Note that a \"##Yes, and\" does not require #someone explicitly #saying 'yes, and...' as part of a #dialogue #exchange, although it could be the #case if it #agrees with the #description above. There are many ways in which a #response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically #saying 'yes, and...'. ",
