We've constantly had arguments with each other and she even started feeling like we weren't meant to be. So the 3rd time I broke it off, I felt sure I wasn't going to be with her, as I had no emotions. This was due to the fact that she is extremely selfish and wouldn't even console me when I was in a bad state. She then started to say things like I'll kill myself if you leave me, or she couldn't get attracted to other men. Being the asshole that I am, I decide to stick with her to make sure she stays safe, but I've really had enough at that point. Fast forward a few weeks later and the lies ensue. I face my fear of having a death on my soul and just tell her I've had enough with the lies, I break it off for the last time and she's quiet for a few days. She hasn't killed herself at that point as I've seen her online and she's tried to message me, (I've blocked her everywhere). Then I get messages from her on Instagram somehow, saying she'll actually kill herself, and I replied with \"well atleast you won't be able to hurt anyone\".......\nI'm not familiar with Instagram but I think if their profile picture disappears they've blocked you? Correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm feeling guilty as fuck and anxiety is eating me alive. I'm religious, so having a death on me is.. Idk how to feel. AITA? ",

She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?",

            "input": "So, there are numerous nuances to this question. \n\nEvery time we hang out, they're drinking. It's like they can't go out without having liquor. I don't drink, so I don't understand the near-constant need to drink. \n\nWhenever we go out around someone's birthday, it ends up as \"We're paying for X's dinner, because it's their birthday.\" Well, this burns me for a few reasons. First is that my friends make a LOT more money than me, but secondly, they always pick something expensive, where I can barely afford food for me, much less an appetizer, drinks, and an entree for the birthday person. Third, it's always something I won't eat. 95% of the time, it's Asian. I'm limited on what I will eat because it will give me bathroom problems if it has too many spices. I'm limited to white rice and a bland meat, with salt and pepper. I do eat other things, and regret it later. An example of this was a friend chose Asian seafood for her birthday. I checked out the (expensive) menu and found one thing I could eat safely, teriyaki chicken and white rice. Birthday girl chose a family-style meal which started at $100, and contained literally NOTHING I could have. So I would've been paying upward of $40 after food, drinks, and tip for food I can't have. \n\nAnother thing is that we have different schedules. I work nights and they all have regular 9-to-5 jobs. When asked when were available to hang out, I'll give them a time, it's agreed on... then changed so I can't make it. This time, I suggested breakfast, because they I can go home to sleep, which THEY AGREED TO, then just today, they've changed it to a liquid lunch and karaoke and then a hard lunch, probably on an Asian place, based on the neighborhood. \n\nI feel like an asshole, mainly because they tell me I am. They tell me I don't try (which is bullshit, I think, as I try many cuisines because I like to eat, and I want to know what I CAN'T eat), but it seems like they're outvoting me as a group to do what the majority wants. Which isn't a problem, I just don't understand why they ask when everyone can make it, then change it so I'm the ONLY person who can't make it. \n\nI made it a New Year's resolution to try to see my friends more, but this situation made me realize exactly WHY I don't like to see them. They always make me feel excluded, mainly because I can't afford to do the things they do (they all just had a spa day together that I found out about via whatsapp), and say \"That's okay, you don't have to come.\" \n\nI feel like, with the spa day, and everything else, just stop inviting me. Hell, I've been trying to extricate myself from these people for years, and it always comes down to \"/U/notastepfordwife, you're not trying, you're kinda selfish, but we love you.\" I feel like, if I'm the asshole, they wouldn't want to be around me, either, right? But they want to hang out, and I keep doubting myself. I know I'm an asshole in some respects, but is this one on me? Am I just not doing all I can to be a good friend?\n\nHelp me out, here. If I'm the asshole, I want to be better than that. But if I'm not, I gotta figure out how to tell them that I AM trying, but I'm not feeling included.",

I adore my grandma so Iâ€™ll do anything to make her happy. When my grandmas at the bingo sheâ€™s a completely different woman, Iâ€™ve never seen her so happy, she walks (with her walking trolly for support) faster than Iâ€™ve ever seen, she smiles, gets all excited and it just makes my entire day.\n\nToday I took her as I always take her the first day after my payday so that I can play along side her (even though I have absolutely no clue what the hell Iâ€™m doing), everything was going as normal, I was losing money in confusion, my grandma was somehow winning constantly as always and we were having fun, about half way through the day another lady sat behind us, I see this lady quite a lot and sheâ€™s there every time Iâ€™m there, her friend came with her and they sat right behind us and spent the whole time chatting super loudly. \n\nNow Iâ€™m not sure if any of you have ever gone to bingo but being able to hear the speaker is vital in order to play, and the usual expectation is that everyone should keep quiet or should speak quietly. But because of them chatting about how the bus driver wasnâ€™t white, and what groceries they bought that morning my grandma was struggling to hear the speaker and I could see she was starting to not enjoy our day. \n\nI decided to not say anything as I know this lady was just catching up with a friend, but after 2 hours of constant talking (they werenâ€™t playing at all) I decided to turn around and I politely said â€œwould you be able to keep your voice down my grandma canâ€™t hear the speaker and sheâ€™s trying to playâ€? the lady looked at me, didnâ€™t respond and went back to her conversation, I decided to let it slide as I didnâ€™t fancy arguing with someone 3 times my age, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she didnâ€™t understand me, about an hour later my grandma got irritated and went â€œ Yap Yap Yap thatâ€™s what they sound likeâ€?, my grandma says things like that sometimes without realising, itâ€™s just how she is now because of her dementia and she canâ€™t help it, evidently the lady heard us because she turned and started having a go at my grandma who didnâ€™t understand what was going on so I said â€œ if you kept quiet then my grandma wouldnâ€™t mock you, so I suggest you shut up, keep quiet, play what you came here for and leave her aloneâ€? to be fair to her the lady did as I said and they kept their voices down. \n\nAfter we left I felt awful, I just feel guilty for being rude but I did what I had to to make sure my grandma was okay, AITA?

One day BF sends me a post from EBF's close friends list saying \"HUGE SHOUT OUT TO MY BEST FRIEND NATHAN FOR BLOCKING ME ON EVERYTHING\" and all the sides were just her showing screenshots of her not following/added on my social media accounts, then I go to text her why did she just stop talking to me all of a sudden, the response she gave me was really childish and didn't even give me a proper straight answer when I first asked her, so when I asked her to tell me why she did again, she said that she needed some times and that she can't always be talking to everyone, the thing that really tipped me over the edge was the fact she started talking to BF even though she said that she wasn't emotionally able to talk to a lot of people even though it's still the same amount of people. We went on and argued a bit then eventually she started saying that I need to think about her more instead of just thinking about how I feel and she tells me that I'm being selfish. I eventually get tired of the whole argument I then say that I should just next time I should understand what and why BF choose to do whatever she's doing and I need to stop being entitled, then she responds with almost the same thing I said to an extent. After this I got so annoyed at myself because I thought I messed up and I'm a complete joke and other self deprecating stuff, then for a bit I went into this stage where I was like \"yeah I'm in the right she was being a massive bitch screw her she doesn't matter to me anymore\" but I feel like I've come full circle but instead I feel awful about this.\n\nThese are the screenshots, I wasn't able to get all of the screenshots of the argument, I lost one or two screenshots but I only have the beginning and the end of the argument: http://imgur.com/a/HZZNnUE\n",

For the most part everything is good, she's a very kind and loving person, and in most aspects I'm happy with the relationship. However, there are a few issues, the most prominent of which is the fact that we haven't had sex in the five months that we've been together (Or the month or two that we had been dating.) \n\nWe've gotten close once towards the beginning of the relationship. Sparing the details, during foreplay she told a joke that we both laughed at for a while, and as the laughter died down she mentioned that it killed her mood, and we could pick up where we left off another time. So, we stopped. It was no big deal, sometimes you're just not in the mood. \n\nAfterwards though any time she started to flirt with me heavily and I would respond in kind, she would respond with something along the lines of 'Hard pass' or 'Down boy,' because 'she's just teasing.' Being rejected so frequently and exclusively is doing a number on my self esteem, and the constant teasing is leaving me pretty frustrated. Strangely, she's frequently mentioned how 'healthy' our sex life is to our mutual friends.\n\nNow, I'm someone who has a high sex drive when I'm in a relationship, and I really need physical intimacy. A decent part of a relationship to me is the feeling of being wanted, and expressing your want for your partner.  I've tried talking to her about it a few times trying to figure out her reason for never wanting to get intimate in case it's something that we can work on, but she has yet to give me a reason beyond just 'not being in the mood.'\n\nConsidering everything else in the relationship is very good I feel like it would be extremely shallow of me to break up with her over sex. But, it's a serious source of stress in my life at the moment. With her either unsure of the problem, or unwilling to talk to me about what the problem is, I don't see it getting any better.\n\nWIBTA?",

(I broke a rule so I fixed it and am reposting) \n\nMy aunt breeds Australian Shepherds. She's a responsible breeder that only does one litter a year, is very careful about lineage and breeding for health along with the typical pure bred traits. She does it as a side business and it helps pay for stuff around the farm and house that they wouldn't be able to afford to get fixed otherwise. She's also just an amazing hardworking woman. When I was nine/ten, she gave me (not sure if my parents paid or not- never asked) my first dog, who was my rock through various issues that come with a rough childhood. I was a kid and made mistakes, but I truly loved this dog and cared for her as best I could. She had to be put down about a year ago now due to age related health issues, and lived to the ripe old age of fifteen.\n\nMy BF and I are getting ready to move into a townhouse, and we'll be looking for an ESA for me for anxiety and depression issues, and as such I'm trying to get a dog that's under a year to make it easier with training. Here's where the issue comes in. I desperately want an Aussie again. The place we're going to has the backyard opening up into a park, and I'm working to keep to a strict schedule that would work with the high energy of an Aussie. Part of me fully believes in the \"adopt don't shop\" mindset, but the other part of me wants an Aussie again. I had thought of adopting from an Australian Shepherd rescue, but now I can't imagine telling this woman that gave me my first dog that I chose to get my next one from somewhere else. And honestly, with her skill in picking personalities of even puppies, I feel like she would be best for getting me a good match.\n\nThe compromise I came to was that once we're settled in and I've been able to faithfully stick to a schedule that would suit a high energy dog, I would go with whatever came up first- either she had a spare puppy that didn't get bought or a rescue Aussie that matched my needs came up. But in the end, if the rescue comes up first, AITA for getting a rescue instead of asking to buy a puppy from my aunt? I know she would save me a puppy from the next litter if I asked.",

My parents weren't very supportive of this decision and said that they wouldn't help me financially to move up there. I took it upon myself to work a fast food job to save enough money to move, and I did. I finally moved up, got a job, live in my own apartment (that I pay for), have a girlfriend, financial security, etc. \n\nA few months go by and it's Christmas time, my parents are nice enough to buy me a train ticket to come down and visit for a week. It was a great time, I see my friends, family, and I have an overall fun time altogether. That is until Christmas rolls around. Everybody was getting gifts except me, which didn't really make me sad, it's all about being around family that makes me happy. Finally at the end, I get a gift from my Mom and Step-dad. I was a bit surprised because I wasn't really expecting a gift. I open it and it's a book, titled \"Manual to Manhood.\" Inside there were instructions on everything that makes a man a man. How to change a flat, how to put on deodorant, how to pick up women, etc. Everything was dumbed down into two pages each, and the information in there were things I already knew how to do. I was a bit upset at the gift because I felt like my parents didn't think I was doing a good job or *manly* enough, or knew how to do anything. I didn't get into an angry fit, but they saw that I was visibly upset and thought that it was ungrateful that I didn't like their gift. \n\nEventually once I got back to New York I ended up tossing it because there was really nothing I could do with it. \nWas I just overreacting asshole?",

I've never understood how anyone can enjoy it, having limited holidays per year, having to show up to a location or work remotely every day without fail. I remember as a child asking my dad when his summer holidays were and being confused/horrified that he didn't get any.\n\nThe funny thing is, I actually have a job I really enjoy.\n\nI'll get the part out of the way that I'm sure most people will call my an asshole for. I live in a country with strong labour laws, I have (for employment) very good annual leave/sick leave compared to the rest of the world. I have a job for a company that I believe is helping the world, I get a good wage and only have to work 40 hours a week. I enjoy what I do, I'm good at what I do, always get praise from management. My team is awesome and I'm good friends with a few of them, no working drama. Pretty sweet right?\n\nWell every day I still feel absolute dread that I have to wake up to an alarm. Realising that I'll be doing this for decades to come is horrifying to me. I've more than once thought about just killing myself to avoid it, not because I'm depressed, I'm not at all. We work so much of our lives and get so little time off in comparison. If I'm sick, or want to take a holiday, I have to inform my work, if I don't I get fired. If I quit my job I lose my house as I can't pay the mortgage. It doesn't help that I feel like I could do my weeks worth of work in about two days but I have to come in every day or I get fired (I have asked my manager for work from home days, that's really a no go and most jobs don't allow it, I've looked extensively). \n\nI legitimately stayed at University for three years longer than I should have just to get the four months off at the end of the year, I used to work multiple jobs during the year to save up enough so I wouldn't have to work over the four months off. That's pretty much impossible to do with a full time job, nobody wants someone who'll work less than 10 months a year.\n\nWhenever I share even the softest version of my view with people they freak the fuck out, talk about how I owe everything to the job, how I need to be a team player and just do it. When I tell people I'm strictly 9-5 and don't check emails or take calls out of hours they also freak out and tell me I'm letting my employer down. I keep this stuff to myself now.\n\nI wish I could be doing anything else. When I have time off I read books, go for walks, go for runs, try new hobbies, watch movies, do volunteer work (not forced to do so I enjoy it significantly more). \n\nSo, am I a huge asshole for hating the whole idea/structure of work?",

I only smoke outside, with the door shut -even before daughter- and he smokes in his apartment. I suspect he typically doesnt smoke in his apartment for the few hours that she is with him because she has never smelled like smoke before, even to my nonsmoker mom. So that leads me to believe he smoked inside this last visit.\n\nI 100% do not believe I have any right to ask him not to stop smoking completely in his own apartment. The only exception being when DD is there. We all know cigarettes are toxic AF (and I really shouldnt be smoking at all), especially for developing children. My stance is that its lazy and selfish as hell not to go outside. I did not say that to him, nor insinuate it.\n\nI explained that shed never smelled like smoke before and for DD's health, please dont smoke inside while shes with him. I dont want her developing breathing issues because of his (and my) choices. She does not have a choice so we shouldn't be making choices for her that harm her. \n\nHis response : he smoked a lot the night before but didnt while she was there and didnt really say either way if hed be sure to go outside to smoke while DD is there.\n\nI didnt say this to him, but I dont really believe him. Hes smoked a lot the night before (evidence on the table) I've dropped her off with a different outcome.\n\nSo here's the actual WIBTA question. He has not made any effort to get his car fixed (hed much rather be chauffeured around) and I usually take DD for visits, with my mom doing pickup if I have to work and ex's parents occassionally helping. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped driving her over there if DD continues to come home smelling like smoke? If he makes other arrangements for p/u and d/o, I likely wouldn't keep her from him, but its doubtful hed do that.\n\n\nWe do not have an official custody in place, so he gets her when he can, but usually *only* when its convenient (which sometimes leads to weeks between visits, it's gotten a little better though). He pays a small amount in child support, usually late. Other than that and the short visits, doesnt do anything to contribute to DD's care. He makes very few sacrifices for DD (I'd say none, with the exception of small CS), the least he can do is take it outside when shes with him for a couple of hours.  I drive her to support the father daughter relationship, but don't want to if hes going to smoke inside. \n\n\nTL;DR : cigarettes are bad and dad wants to smoke inside for the few hours he has our &lt;1 year old. I'm considering not driving her for the visits if he doesnt take it outside.\n\n",

Well the person in the second car points over at me and they exchange payment.  \n  \nMy turn.  \"She bought yours.\"  I'm about to tell him I'd like to buy the person behind me's meal.  Or at least $8 towards it since that was my total.  I figure I was prepared to pay $8, so no big deal.  But I don't say that.  I was prepared to pay for my own, and so is the car behind me, right?  And that's gotta be annoying for the worker to keep telling people, right?  So I just say \"Oh, ok then.\"  And I pull forward to collect my free lunch.  \n  \nThen I eat my free burger and fries on the way to Goodwill.  Thought I'd poke around for some shirts before I go back to the office.  No luck on the shirts, but they DO have a quesadilla maker.  It's $9.  \n  \nSo am I an asshole for using that free lunch money to buy a quesadilla maker instead of paying it forward to all the other people in the drive thru line who also had to wait?",

Bear with me, this might get long but I'll try to only post the facts. \n\nAbout a year ago a girl I knew in high school (almost 15 years ago) friended me on Facebook. We only kind of knew each other through a school club but I figured sure, I'll add her. She started messaging me occasionally and it was nice to catch up, but I still consider us more of acquaintances than real friends.\n\nThis girl has a lot of drama. Her husband has lupus, she's got a myriad of medical issues (supposedly), she's constantly in-between jobs. At one point last year, shortly after I friended her on social media, she was doing a fund-raiser for something medical for her husband. Since I allot about $200 a month for charitable giving, I sent it to her, anonymously. I figured I could give money to someone in need that month instead of my usual organizations and yay, good karma and all that. (I also pointed her in the direction of state and government assistance programs, but IDK if she ever looked at them.)\n\nBut somehow she found out it was me. Since then, once or twice a month, she's asking me for money. Her furnace broke. She needs money to buy wood for their fireplace. She is in debilitating pain and her insurance doesn't cover the bills. She just needs $35 to cover food for the week or she won't be able to eat. Her car broke down. They sold their house in Texas and moved to Wyoming (who *does* that?) and the new house has more problems than they realized. You get the idea. At one point she even asked for like $2500 in startup capital for a bakery she plans to open...\n\nShe always promises she'll pay me back. I'm not that stupid. But since I already plan to spend $200 each month helping others, at first I figured it wasn't a big deal. Lately, however, I'm starting to think that it's just enabling her. The last time she asked for money I told her that $50 was all I could give her and that I can't be her ATM or bank, because even little amounts add up and I have my own family and kids to take care of. I told her I'm seriously done after this, that I wished her the best but I'm tapped out financially and emotionally and I'm just done.\n\nWell, guess who just got a message. She only needs $80 this time because she hasn't slept in 2 weeks and her husband is keeping her up because he's in pain and his disability check hasn't come in... I'm just so over it. Reddit, WIBTA if I just block her without saying anything? ",

He showed back up with a soda and he tried to hand it to me, but I told him I couldnâ€™t accept it because it honestly didnâ€™t feel right accepting an apology for something that was so trivial.

I didnâ€™t get mad because as it wasnâ€™t time to be sleeping I didnâ€™t expect them to walk on eggshells for me.\n\nSo I maybe got ~10 minutes extra.

And my sister, trying to keep the joke going, said: â€œFinfp, itâ€™s time for spring break, chill.â€? My dad said â€œfinfp, settle down.â€? \n\nI was fuming at this point, as they had run into my room, knowing full well I was sleeping and woke me up, then got mad because I was trying to go back to sleep.

Also, the lEcTuReR i'll be calling \"R\".\n\n\\-\n\nDear oh dear, I do regret this term. OMFG.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe unit itself has been poorly managed, as miscommunication from the first lecturer telling us that we wouldn't have midterms and leaving the institute on the fourth week, a third on the term. The following lecturer that assume greet us with a beautiful \"I don't know anything about this subject\" and my first reaction was saying \"then why are you here?\".\n\nPersonally speaking I don't like this guy, yet I wish it was only me not liking him. but we have several problems:\n\n* We had a major project coming up that we were meant to start at week 3. No information were given up until week 9, even though every class I was pretty much demanding info about it, in front of all students;\n* R couldn't bother to do much but read the slides whilst sit on his chair, with the arms crossed. But we all knew he came from  UOW (a prestigious university in NSW) as he loved to brag about it;\n* Students were deliberately coming late, or skipping classes, simply because we could read the slides ourselves. Mind you, Gov't will be on our asses and revoking our visas if we skip too many classes;\n* He was not even reading his own material, as we found material from other subject on his subfolder. Yes, we were meant to submit that for grades;\n* He was pretty much refusing using email to keep contact with students. \n* When questioned about the subject, answers were \"I don't know\", \"\\*insert 40 slides that don't answer the question\\*\" or \"help yourselves\";\n\nMultiple times I took this to the Academic Dean, informally, and enough was said that even a third of the students were to complain about him. With my emotions I happened to respond one of his emails (out of 3 he sent) and all my complaints kinda were not considered anymore as they deemed I was being too emotional, with the Dean herself saying so. When I questioned her about the choice of him being in the position, her answer was \"sadly we hadn't have a choice, but you should give him a chance, he sure feel leftover by you guys, specially by you\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig project came in, with virtually no help me and my teammate did the work just to receive an \"excellent idea but not what I wanted\". And he didn't allowed us to see other presentations yet everyone saw ours, simply because we didn't submit before presenting. Note: there is no policy saying we have to submit before presenting, but we do have the right to fix before submitting. And he forced almost everyone to submit their work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven with my blood boilling, I asked nicely for the feedback that, between \"you can't answer simple questions\", learn how to do a presentation\" and \"I won't tell you\", his final answer were \"feel free to take to the Dean\", even when I mentioned his unethical move. Needless to say, my teammate is fuming, yet we will submit the project as ask the Dean for the feedback on tuesday, four days after the submission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven all that, AITA to follow with formal complaints?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: student can't cope with lazy lecturer, lecturer is petty.",

My sister (when her boyfriend just moved in with her before mine moved in) remarked that we would be a perfect couple because we're both skinny (she is heavily overweight) . I started being cold towards him. When my boyfriend moved in I had issues with her walking in the room in front of my boyfriend in just her underwear and too small shirts that showed her well endowedness. I mentioned this to her boyfriend as I have a severe anxiety problem along with other issues and have trouble confronting people. He said he would deal with it she continued to do the same behavior claiming that \"she didn't care because she loved her body and what we thought didn't matter to her\" I'm speechless at this point. She hardly does anything around the house just sleeps all day and then will wash a dish or so and say she did the dishes or say she cleaned the room I did to our father telling him I sleep all day even though people living here vouch for me. She once bought a bottle of wine for thanksgiving with her boyfriends money and then was upset it was smaller than she remembered and then try to tell my dad I drank her whole bottle of wine and replaced it with a smaller bottle. (mind you I can't buy I'm underage for alcohol and me and my boyfriend did not have a penny to our name at this point in time) she has also taken several of mine and my boyfriends shirts or hoodies and worn them stretching them out  swearing they're hers or her boyfriends, I typically get two sizes up (I fit into a size s) because of reasons and my mother and family know this my mom bought me an extremely cute outfit in light colors to help \"boost my mood\" the shirt was a xxxl, my sister constantly grabs the shirt and says it must be hers because it's her size, we will have that argument every time she sees the shirt. Theres more but this is ridiculously long; My sisters boyfriend has a dog, I have a work in progress to potty train puppy, the family has two dogs. My dog was locked in the kitchen with me as I was cooking, my brother went in my room to find their dog in my room ears down and poop in my room bigger than my dogs and smaller than the families dogs. My boyfriend politely asked her to clean it up, She starts yelling at him, im in the kitchen with a sharp knife and I happen to have a sensory issue so loud noises and stuff can cause issues I ask for them to tone it down, they get louder at this point I proceed to almost cut my finger so I match in there mad and find out what's going on, I ask her to clean up the mess since we clean up our dogs mess and have cleaned up hers enough, she starts called me a bitch and a bunch of other stuff I go off since I'm back in the kitchen giving it right back to her my boyfriend and brother get scared she's gonna come hit me so they go wake up the boyfriend. It's kinda fuzzy from there but the boyfriend came down later and said aggressively \"don't worry we'll be gone by the first\" \n\n\n\nTL:DR- sister has no respect for boundaries and is so painfully lazy she almost got violent to get out of cleaning dog shit, and I want to cut her off even though my father does not; Am I the asshole?",

Long story short, even though she's not my cup of tea while sober, blackout me was more than willing to go home with her and be college kids for the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy awkward and hungover ass couldn't figure out a tactful way to dip out the next morning so we continued to wake up at noon, start drinking again, and make me question my standards again. After sobering up and getting home on Sunday, the two of us came to an agreement that young adults like to fuck around wile drunk, and that's the end of it. Trouble is she kept contacting me, assertively at first, but eventually easing off well after I told her we're done and I had started a serious relationship with a girl I actually liked. \n\nFast forward about a year and a half and I had tried to maintain a platonic communication with her despite her best efforts. I know the easiest thing would be to just block her #/Snapchat, but mixed in with untasteful nudes and drunken pleas to come over see and her were seriously concerning messages about depression and mental instability. Call it my fault or call it bad luck, but either way I seem to have a history of getting overly involved romantically with depressed, anxiety ridden, and/or bipolar women. I want to break any ties with her, but at the same time don't wanna be the trigger that sets off someone who's already claimed to be suicidal. \n\nIn case it wasn't already obvious, I'm not exactly a pillar of emotional stability either, and I've made the mistake of digging myself a deeper hole. Due to a mixture of post break-up loneliness, depression, and alcoholism, I've let my sad dick take control of my brain and slept with her. I'm not even attracted to her, and the fact that I'm too ashamed to confide in my friends about this situation is telling, but I just find myself caving in out of shear boredom almost.

B/c she wants to â€œlose the weight before meetingâ€? the person knowing thatâ€™s the version of herself she wants to be. How long do you talk to a potential date? MONTHS.

How do you think it will make the other party feel? \n\nNext I did some research...ok I binged that catfish show and lurked on reddit...\n\nThe next time it came up I shared how negatively catfishing affects peoplesâ€™ lives. She was so dismissive to that (cuz she thinks she can get away with it ?) \n\nThen she made plans to meet this guy. I told her to at least do a video chat first. So did another close friend that is in the know. But the catfish gets so shady whenever we talk about the situation. I couldnâ€™t get a straight answer but it seems like she did do a video chat and got rejected. Last time I asked how things were going she said she didnâ€™t know if they were still meeting.

I set down my phone and waited till the morning. 7 am I send a block text clearly stating that what she is doing is 100% catfishing and it is wrong and not healthy.

I'd had 1 drink but mixed with my medication, drinks hit me a bit harder than they used to. I wasn't paralytic, but I was definitely not safe to drive.\n\nNow on the estate that I live on, we have a couple of suicidal cats who have a habit of darting through the road. I have told my boyfriend this repeatedly, but he likes to continue going up there at 90mp/h. Last night he wasn't going fast, which is lucky because one of the cats darted across the road. It was still a fair while away, just at the edge of our headlights and he was only going 20. The cat made it across our lane in good time so I thought I'd go ahead and open my mouth to say how I wasn't lying about the cats. Before I could finish the first word, he swerved the car towards the cat in the other lane as a joke.\n\nI was fucking furious.\n\nMaybe the drink had exaggerated my reaction, I will admit that, but as soon as he parked the car I just got out and walked up to my flat with him trailing a ways behind me. I went into the living room and he followed shortly. Now, you'd think I'd be asked if I was ok, or I would get an apology. Nope. I get a \"dude, what the fuck.\" It's at this point I know that it's either get into an argument or change the subject. So I just turned the TV on.\n\nBF: \"Are you actually serious?\"\n\nMe: \"Yep.\"\n\nBF: \"You're actually pissed off about that?\" (so he knew why I was mad)\n\nMe: \"Of course I'm fucking pissed! I'm always telling you about those cats but you still think it's a good idea to swerve into them! Even as a fucking joke, you should have had the sense to not do something so fucking stupid!\"\n\nIn his defense, I did shout first. I didn't start shouting because of what he did though. I started shouting because he knew why, but he didn't care enough to apologise. Had he done that, I would've calmed down. We keep on at the back and forth about how he's a reckless idiot and how I'm crying over nothing, he goes off to eat his food and I start playing some Overwatch and smoking some weed to calm myself down. He comes in afterwards and starts acting cute to try and get my attention and to get me to smile and forget about the whole thing. I was not ready to forgive him yet so I just ignored him and kept playing. Then he starts trash talking my gameplay, which is completely normal in our social circle, so he's still just trying to get me to forget about it. As his attempts continue to fail, he resigns to his fate and slumps next to me. But the things he said next are what really gets my goat. All of this shit is trivial and would've been over and done with in a night.\n\nBF: \"It's like I'm dealing with a fucking six year old.\"\n\nHe has a pattern of doing this shit in our arguments. Shifts the blame onto me and tries to make me feel guilty for being angry. It suddenly clicked when he said that and I started to notice the pattern and why I'm always the one crying at the end. \n\nMe: \"Are you fucking kidding me?! You can't even pretend you're not in the wrong here, you upset me and completely ignored it!\"\n\nBF: \"You have no reason to be upset! It was a joke and you know it! If anyone else had done it, you would have found absolutely hilarious but because it's me, you're pissed off. Cause everyone hates (name) cause it's funny.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh don't even fucking try to pull that shit, I would be pissed off if anyone did that, especially if I was in the car with them!\"\n\nAgain, we had a heated back and forth. This time about how I'm a fucking child and me just unable to comprehend how he can try and villainise me for being upset. It ended with me asking him to leave my flat (we don't live together) but he refused cause it was late and he had work in the morning. I told him sternly that he needs to shut up and leave me alone for the rest of the night or leave. He went to bed and I stayed up all night.\n\nI know it sounds like I've told this story in a very one-sided way, but I promise that there are no details omitted on either side as hard as it might be to believe.

It's like he sucked all my energy and left me feeling empty.\nWhen I was 21 I moved to a different country and he made a scene where he couldn't even say goodbye and left almost crying.\nI had been living here for some time when he called and confessed he loved me and had loved me for quite some time. Call me stupid or naive but I never in a million years imagined this. I thought his strange behavior was just who he is as a person.\nI really felt betrayed. I mean, he cannot choose who he falls in love with, but I think he lied to me so many years about me being his \"sister\" and faking stories about being in love with someone else and never getting over her. \nNow we are VLC and I honestly hate talking to him. I mostly ignore his mssgs, everything about him annoys me or makes me roll my eyes, I just feel like he's my BEC. \n\nHe says I faked him being like family as well because as soon as he confessed I became a different person.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I donâ€™t wanna take the shit from my family for getting a B.\n\nSo, with exams beginning tomorrow, I need to study (Iâ€™m writing this in my 30min break after tea).

I love him, and he needs someone to talk to about his problems, but it really canâ€™t be me, especially right before exams. He has PTSD and life hasnâ€™t treated him well. Most nights heâ€™ll burst into my room without knocking and tell me something random from his past before leaving, only to come back in 10 minutes later to continue the story. It kills me because I love him and want to help, but I always have to try and subtly get him to stop because I have to work. It doesnâ€™t ever solve the issue and I generally just end up having to catch up during school time during my lunch times and stuff. Thatâ€™s not an option with exams, so I ended up telling him to â€œfuck offâ€? on the third time he in in about an hour. He was really take aback and dinner was really awkward cis he was literally holding back tears and made sure he had a good shout at me over the incident.\n\nI really should have given some more obvious hints before bursting, but Iâ€™m kinda stressed and Iâ€™m just not sure anymore.

            "input": "Hi all who decide to read. First time poster here in AITA, but I feel like I'm going crazy and need some insight.\n\nHeres some background:\n\nMy boyfriend(M23) and I(F22) have been together for over 4 years. Back in October 2018 we moved states and got an apartment with his childhood/best friend(M20s). Let's call him C. I've only met and sparsely spoke with C so most of my knowledge of him has been through my bf. Theyve been friends forever so I figured he'd be a decent dude.\n\nJump forward to us all living together. We have a kinda small 2 bed 1 bath apartment. My bf and I in one room and he in the other. The only downside is how small our kitchen is. There's hardly room for 2 people to be in there at once and we have like zero counterspace.\n\nAnyways, I soon realized that C is super fucking messy. Which I wouldn't really have a problem with if he cleaned up after himself like at all. Cause I'm a messy person too but I grew up in a household where if you made a mess, you cleaned it up as soon as you could. Common decency when living with other people right? \n\nThis situation happens almost everyday. Im usually the first up in the morning to drink coffee and read in peace. I also clean the kitchen almost every morning. And by that I mean: load the dishwasher, handwash pots and pans, wipe down the counters and stove top and sweep. It maybe takes 20 minutes. No big deal at all. That is until later that night C comes in and makes the biggest mess. I'm talking pots and pans left on the stove with burned food sitting in them, 10 different bottles of spices on the counters, burned food and stuff all over the stove stop and counters I just cleaned earlier. Plus half the sink is full. You get the picture.\n\nSo when the kitchen is like this and I want to make food or basically do anything, I literally have to clean all this shit up because our kitchen is that small.\n\nAfter the first month of this I was so done. My boyfriend could definitely tell how upset this made me and tried to do whatever he could to help. But what I want is C do be a damn adult and clean up after himself. Is that so much to ask for? Do I really have to ask him to clean his own messes? My bf and I do all the other cleaning in the apartment as well. We vacuum and clean the bathroom and take the garbage out.\n\nThis is turning into a rant but I wanted to give as much info as possible. Do you think I'm being unreasonable for wanting to live in a clean place? I'm so tired of cleaning up after him and it's come to the point where my bf literally has to tell him to clean but even then it's half assed and we clean again shortly after.\n\nWhat are your thoughts reddit? Please tell me if I'm in the wrong and just need to suck it up. I honestly have no idea at this point. Thanks for reading",

We just had two episodes in the past two months where random strangers lashed out at us in public for not letting them go first. She is Asian and I am white and we are in out thirties. She is getting self conscious that this may be happening because we are an interracial couple in a largely white community. I am wondering if there is just a greater expectation in small towns that younger people give older adults a wide berth and let them go first? \n\nThe first episode happened while we were leaving a restaurant. My wife was leaving through a glass door that opened out, and there was a women who looked about 65 years old on the other side. My wife went through first because the door opened out and then held it for the woman. The woman scolded her saying to \"learn some manners.\" I was several people behind, and it looked like my wife was there alone. I caught right up and asked the woman what happened. She told us, \"She should learn some manners and let me go first.\" I told her to lighten up, shrugged it off, and we left. \n\nThe second episode happened today. We were leaving a business while another woman also looking about 65 years old was walking up the path in the opposite direction to us. She was walking slowly as if she might have had arthritis or some other condition that made it difficult for her to get around. We were walking quickly and we cut diagonally in front of her to get to our car, passing about three feet in front of her. She was walking so slowly though that she did not have to slow down on account of us. In fact, if she were to turn towards the door she were headed for rather than walking straight down the right hand side of the sidewalk, she would have had an unobstructed path. She scoffed as we went by.  It was almost like a hiss. We looked back at her out of surprise, and she was glaring at us over her shoulder. \n\nIn all of our years living in various cities, while we have put up with our share of rudeness, we have never experienced anything like this. Is there some unwritten small town code that we should be giving older adults a wide birth and always let them go first? \n\nI like to think it might just be that these are nasty, self centered people who we encountered, or maybe we are just inconsiderate city people on the sidewalk, but I don't know.

I had to use the bathroom for a bit when I hear my mom telling me through the door that I need to change the bucket water that we use to clean the dogs pee with. So after I get out I do as she asks. I empty out the bucket into the toilet, and flush it down. Hereâ€™s where the fuck up begins. I open the shower door of the bathtub to replace the water and close the door a little harder than expected. The bathroom is right next to my sisters room. Apparently I closed it hard enough that the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom shook a little and what was on the shelves fell. At first Iâ€™m totally unaware of what just happened, but then she starts banging the wall and crying her heart out. â€œYou just destroyed my limited edition mermicorno!â€? , she says as I see that part of the tail had broken off.

After a few more minutes of hearing her heart wrenching sobs, the more and more I feel like shit. My mom comes out of the room and gives me the most accusing look.

I have no problem driving him around because he contributes to the payment, but his family is becoming an issue to me. For the record, I like his family, but they do not help him out in any way. His mother mainly loves to mooch for everything she can and never returns the favor. He's always bending over backwards to help her out and it's not been an issue, but it is now since we're using my car. \n\n   We always have to pick several members of his family up for any family events because hardly anyone has cars, which adds an extra 30 minute drive to the location. Last week his mother got dropped off at our work asking us to take her home after I had already told BF, \"No, I'm tired and want to go home already.\" So we had to drive an extra 20 minutes just to take her home after working an 11 hour shift. He says we have to because he pays part of my payment, but I feel like that doesn't cover his family's expenses and they're taking advantage of us. They never cover gas money or do anything for him/us. \n\n   I feel that if I still pay 75% of my payment on a car that's in my name then I should get the most say in where we go. I never had an issue when his car was working, but now I'm running the miles up on my car that I've put much more money into over the years than he has over the past few months. Also he's not on my insurance, so I have to do all the driving because he's not covered. We had a fight last night because I said I wasn't taking any family members anywhere else until they covered their expenses at least. I feel less like a part of the family and more of a taxi driver.

We were talking on the couch, started making food, and then she invited some friends she hasnâ€™t seen in a while over. Three guys came over and as soon as they got there, one of the guys kept telling me how I need to â€œget out and go home because you know whatâ€™s going down.â€? I never met these guys before and thought they were just playing and being drunk until the big friend decked me and I went flying into the wall. The friend in the back started screaming what are you doing?? On the floor, clearly not in a good position to start a fight, I went to leave and the big friend pushed me out the door and I again went flying into the wall outside the apartment. Then went to my nearby friends place, and called the cops from my friends phone. I then went back because my shirt, wallet, keys, and phone were still at her place. Outside her door my shirts thrown in the middle of the hallway. I slowly open the door, and was told to get lost because â€œstuff was going down.â€? As I was walking down the hallway I hear, â€œHey pussy want your stuff back?â€?. So I go back and they throw my stuff on the ground. I thought I could hear my friend crying/in distress in the room but I could also be mistaken. So then I called the cops, told them I thought there was a rape occurring at that address. They show up to knock on the door and thereâ€™s no answer. \n\nItâ€™s the morning after, I for whatever reason couldnâ€™t get much sleep last night. Woke up to texts from a different friend told me that it was wrong of me to do that because my friend was underage drinking, that guy was her ex-boyfriend and everything was fine. \n\nHavenâ€™t heard from the friend despite me texting her. AITA for calling the cops? How should Iâ€™ve handled the situation, I thought about taking the guys on (wasnâ€™t sober myself) but it was 3 on 1 and I was in no state to fight given how drunk I was.

Kinda long but i feel some of the context is important.\n\nI have been casually dating this girl for a few weeks now (its exclusive but complicated.. ill dive in to that later down) and its been amazing. We've known each other for a few months but had a connection from the start but only started really getting more serious a few weeks ago when we got really close after a particular event that happened. We talked non stop 24/7 for these past weeks been on dates got physical, the usual dating stuff.\n\nThe complicated part comes in because she was talking to someone else up until and before the event that brought us closer together. She asked me for my patience and discretion while she handled that situation to make everything work out, it was a coworker of hers so she didn't want that affecting her job. I agreed to stay patient and let her sort it out in a timely fashion.\n\nFast forward to the other day and we along with a few friends are drinking and hanging out and i start doing some couple things like putting my hand on her butt and arm around her/rubbing her back etc. She seems to enjoy it and reciprocates for awhile but does tell me to stop and not in front of them. I did for a little while but due to being somewhat intoxicated i went back to doing the stuff again. \nThe real issue is some of the people we were with are friends with the guy she was talking to and since she hadn't fully sorted it out she feels i disrespected her by exposing us before she could handle everything. \n\nEverything seemed fine on the drive home we were holding hands touching each other having a good time until her phone starts dinging with messages as soon as we get home with her friends that were with us questioning what was going on, she didn't elaborate with what they were saying just that they were blowing up her phone about me and us now. \nThis is when she and i had a talk where she said she felt i disrespected her and went against my word per our conversation about being discreet she then asked me to leave because she was upset.\n I see her point of view about it but i also feel like its only a issue because her friends were making it a issue after the fact. In my opinion we were having a great night and the drive home was a lot of fun and we were laughing, singing along, smiling back and forth, holding hands and caressing each other her mood instantly changed when her phone started going off when we got home.\n\nTLDR- Girl I've been seeing wanted to be discreet for the time being i exposed us to some of her friends and she is mad at me\n\nAm i the asshole? \n",

So anyway I look at it and all the plates are from Ohio ( I'm in southern Michigan) so I instantly knew it wasn't him after seeing that.

The doors are the outdoorsy Style with big glass windows, I don't really know how else to describe them they're really old. But anyway there's curtains over them but you can still see through barely. Especially when it's sunny outside in the window in the room is shining through. Anyway I saw Two Silhouettes back there and instantly knew who it was.

Recently (within the past year) I have been joining their group on social outings, birthday dinners, drinks, get togethers with the kids, etc.  At the beginning of November we all did a 5k together and went out to dinner that night.  Since then, I have been invited to ONE gathering, which included all the children and involved bringing food and gifts.  The rest of the ladies have gotten together at least six other times, including a New Year's gathering.  I have not been invited, and have seen multiple posts on fb about all the fun.  \n\nRecently one of the ladies posted about planning a trip and asking for recommendations.  I asked about the trip and she said I was welcome to come, giving me dates, hotels where they have reservations, etc.  I replied that I didn't know they were that far into the planning process and didn't want to intrude.  One of the ladies I am quite close to (exercising with her four days a week) and I told her I felt excluded.  She said they had planned the trip as a celebration of her upcoming divorce finalization (which she and I have discussed at length) and I SHOULD come and I shouldn't feel excluded.  I just dropped it at that time.  Two weeks later, same friends posting about an outing that I again wasn't invited to.  \n\nAt that point I unfriended them, thinking that they don't HAVE to invite me, and if I don't know about the outings then I won't feel excluded.  My closest friend texted me to ask why I unfriended them and I told her.  She said that they weren't intentionally excluding me and she didn't intend to hurt my feelings.  I told her I understood, and I didn't think she was doing anything wrong, I'm just protecting my feelings.  AITA for unfriending??\n\nTL;DR: my group of girlfriends keeps excluding me so I unfriended them so I wouldn't have to see what I'm missing. AITA??",

(Out phones are basically glorified Ipods.) \n\nMy mom and dad are very protective, and essentially keep me and my five siblings cooped up. Usually this would be fine, but for a major extravert seeing people other than family only once a week isn't near enough. All the kids but my oldest brother and sister, (19 and 17), aren't allowed on social media, and can't talk to *anyone* we don't know online, no public discord servers, no chat on games, no Reddit, YouTube, steam forums, et cetera. They also have a rule of no dating until 18.\n\n I eventually just gave up on no game chat because I'm an extrovert and it's painful not being able to talk to people. Making other people happy, telling them jokes, making them laugh, it's what makes me happy. So I started chatting in game. \n\nSo usually I go to bed and read on a Kindle tablet for a bit, but one night it was late and I was too tired to read. I started watching YouTube, and I loved it. I loved interacting in the comments, making jokes, just watching YouTubers. This lead me to discord servers, Reddit, online freinds, and webtoon. Overall, I've been pretty responsible with what I veiw online. There have been multiple times where my parents almost found out, but I just denied it because I'm a compulsive liar and kind of a pussycat when it comes to owning up. \n\nWhat makes this even worse is that I want to become a creator, making animations for YouTube, and illustrating for webtoon, but my parents obviously have a rule against that. I have a messed up sense of self worth, based on how many people know *of* me but don't *know* me. I want to make a difference outside of my friend group you know? Sooo, I've been drawing for a writer I met on webtoon behind their back. \n\nAnother thing about this that upsets me, there's a girl in my class who I think actually likes me, which is a first. (Up until now I haven't really been attractive to say the least, but I look better now.) and I really like her too. But if she ever asks me if I like her, I'll have to turn her down, because my parents wouldn't approve of it.\n\nTo be honest, I actually want my parents to find out at this point, but I can't bring myself to do it. And guys, this post actually isn't for self validation or anything, for the most part it's just to vent because I need to tell *someone.* I know that I'm at least a bit of an A-hole for it.",

We mostly use it to send each other memes or videos of each other drunk on the weekends for a laugh, but I would definitely say we have a crude to dark sense of humor and some of the stuff might be in poor taste. I wouldnâ€™t say I have a â€œlineâ€? to be crossed, so to speak, on any of the jokes made. Until I found out I did. A mutual friend that had been added to the group recently, one who it wouldnâ€™t bother me in the slightest if I never heard from again, decided a few months ago it would be funny to send some footage of what could be described as a hostage situation with a drug cartel Iâ€™m assuming. They had a man tied up with a bag over his head and they were slicing into his torso with a knife. Iâ€™m talking like you can see the fat under his skin type slicing. Since this is Snapchat the video plays automatically when you open it so I had no choice whether I saw it or not. Iâ€™ll never get that image out of my head, this man was being tortured. So I pretty much said that if this is what the group chat was going to turn in to then they should let me know so I can leave, I wouldâ€™ve preferred to have not seen that. It was met with some pretty heavy backlash, things like â€œyouâ€™re being a babyâ€? â€œyou have a weak stomachâ€? things like that. I got in a big argument with everyone, it seemed *insane* to me that I was the one being looked at like an asshole and weak for saying I would leave the group over that and didnâ€™t want to see it. My friends like to act like nothing bothers them or grosses them out (maybe itâ€™s true, I donâ€™t know), I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re bad people. Whatever. It blew over, havenâ€™t had anything like that since. Fast forward to yesterday and they were talking about some gross skin related stuff, which is more tame, but I still think is gross. A reasonable thing to find disgusting I think. So I literally just sent a picture of a grossed out face in response and it blew up again â€œwhat are you gonna leave the group? Does your tummy hurt?â€?. I explained that itâ€™s not the same thing and we got in an argument that eventually ended. This all happened early in the morning, so when the member who sent the torture video before read the argument he sent the video **again** just to be an asshole. I acted like it didnâ€™t bother me this time because I had already seen it, but I thought that was so disrespectful. Everyone else is acting like Iâ€™m the asshole for making a big deal out of not wanting to see things like that, but I think any normal person wouldnâ€™t want to see videos like that.

I have very bad sleeping habits and I use weed in the evening to relax) \nHe argued my illness ( Morbus Crohn ) is something I always cry about and that I have 0 Teamspirit and every other coworker is better than me and showing more will to work. \nHe told me if my illness is true im not able to work this job and should get a job in an office ( thats actually something i really would like tbh).\nI asked him why hes not firing me if hes so disappointed in me and he argued that he cant simply find someone to fill the spot with. \nAfterwards we stopped discussing and I went into the store to grab a sheet of paper and wrote my termination. \nIm mentally and physically done and yet I feel bad for leaving as a lot of work is before them and my landlord is my friend and I need to find a new job quickly but apprently im a shit worker. My landlord told me he could understand me and that I shouldnt apologize to him but I dont wanna use my friendship status for extras. \nSo AITA for quitting on the spot after being told what I was told only because I wanted to not travel far for little hours which would have been extra hours anyway. \nIm really unsure wheter im just a big baby and should man up or wheter I stood my ground and left b4 worse fallouts could have happened.\nI really desire to into a clinic for mental health right now tbh.",

We work together have similar interests and world views. We had also been living together for the past 2 years. Up until recently I actually looked up to him and thought he was honestly the most well rounded person I had met around my age.\n\nA little over a year ago I started dating my SO (21F) a few months in for convenience she essentially moved in. Things had been going pretty well but we started having some issues but we were keeping it together. As background for the upcoming story she is also easily the biggest lightweight I have ever known. anything past 4 regular light beers and she starts getting trashed. \n\nSo about a month ago we're all drinking sitting in the living room and I've gotten to the point where I want to taper off and start going to bed. It's around 2 or 3am and my SO has work the next day while I do not. I recommended she come to bed so she doesn't feel too bad in the morning. She's also getting to that point of no return level of drunk where shes slurring pretty heavily, laying in awkward positions, and general tells of someone being very intoxicated.\n\nShe tells me she thinks she should just stay up at this point so she doesn't accidentally sleep through her alarm. I guess that makes sense I tried to convince her otherwise but generally shrug it off and go to bed.\n\nI woke up the next day and everything seemed alright but my SO eventually came up to me later in the day and explained that her and my best friend and fooled around the night before. I was upset but I've been cheated on before so I wasn't hopelessly crushed. I went to my best friend in the other room and asked him what happened he tried to say they only made out. She told me different but I didn't let him know that. I also asked him if he planned on telling me and he shrugged his shoulders and said hey man I dunno its awkward.\n\nOver the next few days the SO filled me in on some more details that I asked for to get a better grip on the situation.\n\nEssentially most of the time was harmless till he came over started putting the classic moves that you do then proceeded to talk badly about me and how I am including some stuff that feels completely made up while he talked her up about how nice she's been ya know... the classics. She was the one to eventually stop what they were doing and walk away.\n\nI condensed alot of it but if the specifics of what happened are needed I can edit it in later or make another post later.\n\n\\---------------------(What I have done)\n\nSo knowing all that I can tell you how I've been handling it.\n\nFor my best friend I've done everything I can to avoid seeing him or acknowledging him in the apartment. I've made plans to move out as soon as I have the place available I'm gone. I felt I gave him his chance to explain his side and he shrugged his shoulders. He also didn't say another word or even a sorry till 3 weeks later while he was shitfaced. I can forgive mistakes even monumental ones like that but lying about it then not planning on telling me and the way he went about it just seems sleazy and malicious. also he is quite a heavy drinker so he can handle his drinks and he wasn't that bad off when I went to bed.\n\nFor the SO at first I told her to be moved out by new years. She was honest she knew she fucked up and she hated herself for it. She beat her self up enough so I was perfectly content with acting like nothing happened until she moved out to allow her to have a smooth transition. Recently though we have been talking about possibly working things out and I'm just very unsure of it. \n\nOn one hand she was honest with when in reality that's a hard thing for most people to admit to someone knowing full well you'll earn nothing but that person's anger and hate in return. On the other honesty can't get you out of everything nor can alcohol as an excuse and if we continue on it will be very hard for me to remember this and have it lorded over her when she might be acting shitty towards me. I know that isn't right but I'm human too and I don't know how I might feel later down the road. I also feel that maybe the part that wants to work on it is just being weak afraid of being alone after losing the only 2 people I really interact with outside of work. If that's so then that's unfair to her.\n\nI've talked to some friends at work about it which is the closest petty thing I've done to the best friend however I legitimately wanted their opinion (2 older males) but part of me did feel like I was exposing a fraud. They were surprised considering how close we we're but they think I should give him another chance or some sort of leniency.\n\n\\-------------------------(TL;DR)\n\nSo after all this AITA for completely shunning my best friend while forgiving my SO and possibly letting her back into my life fully",

(We're in our late twenties, early thirties.)\nMy in-laws disliked me from day one, trying to make it work with them never had the effect my husband and I had hoped for. There have been times they didn't even talk to her son, two to three years in total (petty reasons). My husband always stands up for me, so that's never been an issue between us.\n\nA couple of weeks ago they asked him how we handle the \"dog problem\" when we're going on vacation. He told them how it is: we always take him with us, usually hiking and car camping.\n\nA few days go by and my husband tells me his dad invited him on a trip to the US, he'll let him pick all the places he wants to go, he'll pay for everything.\nWe're from Europe and money is a little tight so it's a big thing. \n\nPart of me now wishes my husband had said no, since they had first asked about the both of us...and their \"solution\" is to invite him only instead of finding something suitable for our situation?\n\nNow for the stupid part:\nI wouldn't even have wanted them to pay for anything anyway, I would've probably declined any offer. We don't get along, I am simply not the woman they would've wanted for their son.\nThey weren't there when their son needed them, he had to take a student loan (which we're still paying off) because his dad didn't feel it was his obligation to support his son who's the first academic in his family. My in-laws aren't filthy rich but they're quite well-off. It's their money and they shall do with it whatever they please. \nOffering my husband a trip that'll cost them a couple of thousand Euros after they have just recently re-established the connection (after a year of silence, see above) just gives me a weird feeling, besides being kind of hurt because he accepted without hesitation.\n\nHis mom has been spoiling him ever since they're in touch again, too. She sent him several three-figure amounts of money for Christmas, his birthday etc. It's a little much and unusual. \nI'm all for loving parents but I'm afraid they might hold it against him some day.\nHis whole family is messed up because of money - e.g. his dad and uncles don't talk anymore because of their dad's heritage.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to be thrilled about the whole thing?\n\n\n\nTl; dr: My usually cheap in-laws invited my husband to an expensive trip to the U.S. and I'm having a hard time feeling happy for him.",

And gram has been sick for the last 8 months. Triple-bypass, lungsfilling up with fluid and so on. Gram is obviously dying.\n\nNow Gram for the most part is a good person, she raised the 6 kids that have caused all the toxicity but Iâ€™ll let that go. \n\nSo we got a call last night that gram is most likely not going to live thru the next 2 days. My personal opinion is good. Let her die, sheâ€™s 95 years old and still babysits 4 kids that these scumbags just dump on her because they donâ€™t wanna be bothered. Sheâ€™s still paying for her genuinely medically diagnosed lunatic daughter living in the house. And her absolutely vile human being of a son who just mooches. And every time heâ€™s threatened to be thrown out, he just holds onto the â€œmom wonâ€™t let youâ€? card. And he wins. \n\nNow Iâ€™m sitting in the hospital waiting room, my wife is in the icu with her grandmother, and sheâ€™s found out that her mother and uncle have decided gram should die at home. But theyâ€™re not telling anyone. \n\nMind you the 29 year old grandson whoâ€™s given up his whole life to take care of his grandmother lives there as well. Pays his own way and has taken care of gram, crazy daughter (his mom) and scumbag son (uncle) his whole life.  Heâ€™s supposed to get the house after she dies. But if she dies in the house heâ€™ll have to disclose it to every potential buyer (we live in a state with that law), have to clean up the mess, and have to deal with his crazy mother losing her shit because she saw her mother dead. \n\nBut thru all this, I just donâ€™t give a fuck. Iâ€™m here for my wife because she needs support, but\nEven that is hard to muster sometimes. Most of\nThe support she needs is to deal with her scum bag family. I told her that the second I see her being dragged into drama, Iâ€™m physically pulling her out of it and weâ€™re leaving. \n\nTL:DR - wifeâ€™s grandma is dying and I genuinely donâ€™t care\n\nAm I the asshole?

Both of his parents passed in that house, and he would like to go the same way.  Normally, there would be no problem with this.  There are home heath aids for a reason, and I dont mind taking food over to him semi-regularly.  However, his home I recently learned, is not fit for human habitation. \n\nNo, you're thinking, but OP if he's been a family friend since before you were born how were you never in his house before? Well, because cats and I like breathing. But seriously, he never hosted gatherings and when extra folding chairs or the like were needed he would go over and get them and bring them back. He's a super private person and has always been well groomed and presentable.\n\nHis health took a turn for the for the worse about a year and a half ago when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Chemo weakend him but he kept going. ~5 mo ago he got the news that it spread all through his body in the form of bone (and I think lymph node) cancer.  Stage 4. He doesn't have much medical background and doesn't want to know, but I don't think he has more than a month or three left. He can barely hold a conversation much less go upstairs to his bedroom without being out of breath.  He'll fight to the end. \n\nHerein lies the problem: I always knew he had a lot of stuff, he would talk about it but I didn't realize how bad it was. I found out how bad when I dropped of food and he couldn't get up out of bed to put it away himself. The kitchen sink doesn't drain, there was a water leak in the upstairs bath and now there is two inches of mold hanging from the downstairs bathroom ceiling, the bathroom likely hasn't been cleaned in years with shit all over the toilet. He doesn't take the garbage out and there's even mold on the egg shells. I ended up nauseous and bordering on an asthma attack after being in there for 2min. There are paths to get through the rooms but they are narrow - I'm sure a fire marshal would have a fit. I'm concerned about his basic hygiene at this point. When I saw all this it was 6:30pm and he admitted he hadn't been out of bed or eaten yet that day.\n\nWere he not dying, I wouldn't hesitate to call the county and get him help for the hoarding.  But since he is, which is more important: his mental health or what physical health he has left? A week in the hospital in December yeilded anxiety attacks from being separated from his stuff.  So, would I be the asshole for calling and getting him sent to a county home for the short remainder of his life? Or do I leave him to die in peace in his filth?",

Now that they're starting to put on pressure as to why she isn't further along than she is, I recently was told by another coworker that she is claiming that I never let her do the job, and only let her watch.\n\n95% lie. I made her observe on the first day, and twice after that when she would get so far behind or make silly mistakes, did I instruct her to study while I caught up. Other than that, we worked 50/50 (this is a desk job with two \"stations\", and I let her run the easy side for practice).\n\nAnyway, I want to send an email to the higher ups to defend myself and explain, but the only thing stopping me is that I haven't been accused of anything (management really liked how I did things and I got a great review) and I don't think my input will have much effect on if she gets the job permanently or not.\n\nI'm just super pissed, rightfully so imo, that she would try and blame me for her shortcomings, and I don't know if it would be an unnecessary (asshole) move to bring details to light with higher ups to defend myself.

My first ever relationship, which stretched for seven months (probably far too long), had recently ended, and I wasn't taking it as well as I'd have liked. I had a hard time facing and spending time with my ex, and pretty much went into radio silence with both her and our group of mutual friends. One such friend had known me since sixth grade, and to this day I still don't blame him for how things ended up happening and still call him one of my best friends.\n\nSo basically, this friend, I'll call him Jay, and I ended up sharing a class together... I think it was Chemistry? Well, somewhere along the line, my ex, who I'll call Dee, ended up dating him. He actually told me he'd had feelings for her since middle school, when I'd hardly known her at all (we met in Sophomore year). Due to her schedule of taking college classes and high school classes, she'd have several \"Filler\" periods at school where she was free to go anywhere she pleased within the school. \n\nShe chose to visit Jay, and would often sit with him, talk to him, simple things like that. They were obviously never physically intimate in class, no kissing or even really holding hands, but her presence there always just... bothered me. To put it to words, I guess it felt like hammering in the fact that I had failed to keep her interest, the fact that I hadn't made enough of an effort to spend more time with her. I think I was comparing how our relationship had been with her current relationship with Jay. We were... lukewarm, only saw each other for sparse dates, often without very good conversation, and exactly zero physical intimacy. Yet here they were, able to make time and talk to each other fluidly and easily. I'd even seen them in the common area once when they both had a free period, just talking and holding each other.\n\nSo after a while of this, I decided to take things into my own hands. After class I pulled the teacher aside and asked him to keep Dee from visiting the class again. I didn't want him to tell her that I was the one who requested it, but I feel like she knew anyways. Thinking about it now I feel so petty about having done that, like I should have just let it roll over my shoulders. I let my jealousy and low self-esteem get in the way of her happiness.\n\nI don't know how aware she was about how I felt about her and Jay's relationship, and I never outwardly told her. I sort of made up and broke radio silence near the end of senior year, but it was never the same, and I haven't spoken with her once since graduation. She and Jay ended up splitting up, and I have spoken to Jay since, even visited him when I was back home.",

My fiancee (28F) is only working part time right now at a coffee shop, roughly 20 hours a week or so for the past year while she finished up college courses. She just was accepted in nursing school and starts soon. Because of this, I mostly pay for our rent. We live comfortably thanks to my pay but I am not saving up much.

I want her to finish school so we both have careers and have the life that we want.\n\nOn my days that I work, she frequently and almost always goes downtown to our city's bar scene. She meets up with her friends for beers and stays out very late drinking. Her friends never went to college or pursued anything, so going out and drinking is what they normally do. Now, normally she does have a few (I'm guessing around 3-4) but there are a few nights where she's gotten drunk, much to my annoyance. Not only that, I think it's a total waste of money. She's not making much so why waste it on $7 beers? My annoyance is only compounded by the fact that I want to buy a house, start a family and move on with my life, not spend my weekends at bars or taking care of a drunk.\n\nI guess this is where my question comes in. AITA if I disapprove of her choices while I'm away?

In the process, I became close with a lot of my teachers. When my sister started attending the same high school, these teachers practically let her get away with murder. My sister not only enjoyed the attention, but seemed to think that she deserved it. She lost friends because this smugness.\n\n\\-I started working and saving up for a car since I was 16 because my parents believed that if I wanted a car so badly that I should earn it. A few years  after buying the car, I was looking to upgrade, and wanted to sell my old car. My parents insisted that I give the old car to my sister. For free. What the actual fuck. \n\n\\-I attended an Ivy League school that LOVES \"legacy students\" (i.e. relatives/descendants of people who went to said school). I didn't have any sort of legacy status (first generation) when I was applying to colleges, but my sister did when she applied to my alma mater. She got in. I was SHOCKED because her grades and EC's are mediocre at best, not something a legacy status can easily overcome. I asked a friend who worked in admissions, and was told that they considered my sister an \"investment\" because I was an active undergrad (won national awards, very involved in campus leadership, etc) and now an active alum. Once, when she was acting all high and mighty and bragged about getting into the college by \"working hard,\" I let this fact slip and she accused me of lying and being jealous.\n\nI've tried talking to her, but she gets very argumentative and whines about how I just can't be happy for her. I've also tried to talk to my parents about this, but they come up with bullshit excuses. My favorites are \"It's your responsibility as the older sibling to help out as much as possible\" and \"We treat you differently because, when we die, you will have had 4 more years with us than she will.\" \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for resenting my sister?

The party itself was fine and everyone was very nice. Most of the people there I had not met yet so he went and introduced me to a bunch of his olds friends. We ended up talking with one couple in particular for a majority of the time and they seemed really nice and nothing felt out of place or weird. My husband and the other husband said we should all get together sometime to hang out.\n\nThis weekend we finally had dinner with them this past weekend. Nothing overly weird or awful happened but I kept noticing the wife giving my husband odd looks and looking vaguely uncomfortable when we were talking one on one and making offhand comments that alluded to her knowing my husband better than me which I didn't pick up at the time but when I thought about it later on that night it seemed like weird things to say. \n\nSo, Sunday night I come out and ask my husband if they maybe had dated during high school/college. He said no, you know I didn't really date much at this time (he has told me previously that he slept around with pretty much anyone and didn't seriously date until he was 23). Naturally I ask if they have had a relationship outside of dating and he explains that he had a pretty steady physical relationship that continued for about 4 years when she moved for a new job.\n\nAt that time I no longer felt the need/want to continue hanging out with this couple. My husband got confused and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained that I didn't want us to maintain a relationship with someone he had been intimate for so long with. He thought that was dumb and made a comment to the fact that she didn't seem to have an issue with it. I argued that based off of her reaction, she possibly did have an issue with it. I also said that I was surprised her husband even wanted us to hang out, and that is when my husband said that he doesn't think her husband actually knows about their relationship. \n\nThis snowballed into a huge fight and I said that it wasn't up for discussion and he called me crazy and insecure for assuming anything would happen between the 2 of them now.

            "input": "So first, some backstory.\n\nDuring my sophomore year in high school I met this girl (who we'll call Sarah) and we hit it off quite well. We developed feelings for each other and we kept on talking until the last day of summer break when she told me she didn't like me anymore. I was heartbroken for months, but then I met this other girl (who we'll call Anna) who helped me out of that dark place, and I then realized I started to have feelings for her and as it turns out they were mutual but she was not allowed to date so we just kept it on the down low for about a year, but I found she was a bit emotionally unavailable, so I explained that I craved more affection and emotion and broke up with her basically. So at this point we are in Senior year and not long after that one of me and Anna's mutual friends (who we'll call Sally) said that she liked me, and I saw that as a means of getting the things I craved so I decided I was down but she changed her mind at the last minute and we never became a thing. So Anna found out about that and was even more hurt than she already was (she had been having breakdowns in the middle of class and stuff like that according to yet another friend who is not important to the rest of the story, to which I replied \"where was that emotion when I needed it?\", but I digress) because it was as if I had never cared about her in the first place which really wasn't the case. I felt so bad and I really wanted to repair our relationship, but then Sarah comes back and explains that the reason she had told me she no longer liked me was just because past relationship trauma from her middle school years made her go into panic mode and she did not want to leave herself vulnerable again, but her feelings for me never truly went away, and what made her come back was that she actually tried being with a different guy but the guy ended up getting back with his ex without even telling Sarah about it so Sarah, now knowing how I felt originally, went back to me to apologize and wanted to try us again but for real this time. We wanted to wait until the whole thing with Anna and Sally blew over before we became official, but they ended up finding out because Sally was actually Sarah's best friend and I was texting Sarah but Sally had her phone at the time taking pictures for snapchat. So Anna is even more upset at me now and so is Sally because now it's like I never cared about either of them. I feel absolutely horrible that I caused all of this, I really never intended for any of this to turn out the way it did. I used to look at guys who were players in disgust but now I am just disgusted at myself that I became one of them. Sarah and I just decided to become official since there's really nothing to lose now but I am still trying to forgive myself. I was being so stupid. This series of events (which I'll call The Crisis to refer to it later) was my first real experience with relationship drama and I'm trying to take as many lessons from it as possible, better I learn now than later right? But anyways, now for the actual story. \n\nSo I was texting Sarah and she told me that one of our mutual friends (who we'll call Chris) had been mean to her after Anna and Sally interrupted a conversation she was having with a mutual friend of me, Sarah, Anna, and Sally (who we'll call Aaron). Sarah had a theory that Sally was trying to steal away their mutual friends from before The Crisis, which would explain the interruption but the facts are unclear. It is no secret that Chris liked Anna so it would make sense if Chris was simply putting on a show for Anna so I decided to confront Chris even though Sarah said it was okay. I texted him saying \"Were you mean to Sarah to put a show on for Anna?\" and he explained that he didn't mean to make Sarah feel bad, he thought that was just their banter because they were being jokingly mean to each other just that morning. I was satisfied, I just wanted to know what happened after all, and that was supposed to be the end of it but turns out Chris had screenshotted the conversation and I assume showed it to Anna, making fun of me for thinking his act was a show for her. Anna probably told Sally about it because Sally somehow found out and texted me saying that she did not even talk to Aaron to begin with and that I should keep her name out of my mouth. She was acting like I was spreading rumors or something but I literally only spoke to Chris who was involved anyway. But what confused me is that she claimed she didn't talk to Aaron so I asked Chris about it since he saw the whole thing and he confirmed that Sarah was talking to Aaron when Anna and Sally came and interrupted the conversation. I asked him for permission to use that as proof and when he said yes I screenshotted what he said and showed it to Sally to which she replied that all she did was call Aaron's name and then Aaron started talking to Anna. I was pretty sure that still counts as interrupting the conversation but I thought this whole situation was extremely petty so I just let her have the last word and let that be the end of it. I then told Sarah what had happened and she got so upset with me. She kept saying that I should've dropped it when she said it was okay and that it was none of my business. She didn't talk to me for like a day after that and in the meantime I was talking to Chris about the whole situation and we both agreed that neither of us had the intention of escalating the situation to this height. When Sarah finally did explain why she got so upset, she explained that she did not want Sally to hate her any more than she already did, she did not want to poke the bear so to speak. As I previously explained they were best friends before The Crisis, and I guess she still wanted to find a way to remain that way but that confuses me because she knew that trying to be with me in the first place would mean losing her, so I assumed she was prepared for that and thought I was worth it. I explained to her that I don't think she can have the both of us at the same time and that I don't want her to go on a wild goose chase for Sally. I just think this whole situation was extremely petty and honestly should not have even happened. \n\nThis is a long one so thanks if you read the whole thing, but without further ado: AITA?",

He has had rumors going around about how he gets girls drunk so he can make advances on them and is generally a terrible guy. He has forgotten to pick her up before and yelled at her while she cried and didnâ€™t want to talk to him because he forgot. Basically heâ€™s scum of the earth. Iâ€™m not sure if she actually knows about the rumors going around or realizes how terrible he is for her but she does complain about him to me and says how they might break up soon. \n\nAnyways, tonight I sent her a simple selfie Snapchat intending to start a conversation and instead got a picture of her boyfriends smug smile. He went into her phone to respond to me because he is clearly intimidated by my recent presence in her life. I decided to send a message basically calling him out and asking if he took advantage of any girls/ got girls drunk recently.\n\n\nThe reason this rumor is believed to be true is because my girlfriend knows a couple girls that had a thing with this guy and have told her about how horrible he is. He asked his previous girlfriend to â€œtake a breakâ€? only to have her walk in on him having sex with another girl. Even though this was just a rumor, he replied with a video of him screaming at the phone over and over saying:\n\nâ€œWTF DID YOU JUST SAY!â€?\n\nMy first thought was if someone accused me of something like this and they werenâ€™t true accusations, why would he respond in such an angry and defensive manner. She has told me about his anger issues and how he yells at her almost daily, so I really hate this guy.\n\nI know this was an immature thing to say but he is actually emotionally abusing my friend and yells at her while she cries. He then blocked me on her phone and I was supposed to get a ride home from her from the airport tomorrow. I do have her phone number however. Along with wondering AITA, should I even bother talking to her or just get another ride? Iâ€™m not sure if she would be upset with me or him and donâ€™t know if continuing to try to reach her while she is with her boyfriend is the best idea for me or her.\n\nThank you for any responses in advance.\n\n",

However, she did a complete 180 in terms of both personality and reason-wise, pretty unemotionally telling me that she â€˜likedâ€™ me a lot, but that the main reason was actually due to a personality clash which hadnâ€™t been apparent during the relationship (at least, in my eyes.

When growing up I only ever really interacted with a small handful of people, so I'm usually a little lacking on social cues.

I know it's stupid and I know they do actually care, but it's just something my mind likes to tell me every once in a while. Itâ€™s usually a problem and I can ignore it. Iâ€™ve had the same group of friends for about 8 years, and for the past year and a half weâ€™ve been getting together weekly to play games and hang out. \n\nThis happened in August. One of the guys from the group, Iâ€™ll call him John, was telling my fiance about how he thinks Iâ€™m a jerk and heâ€™s not close to me or anything, and hasnâ€™t been since weâ€™ve started our weekly hang out. Saying I just make fun of him all the time. TBF we all usually joke with each other a lot, though if someone goes too far we say something. He never once told me I was taking it too far or that he felt disrespected, and I had no idea that he felt that way. He would just act the way he always did around me. We got together as a group to talk about it and when I heard it really hit me hard. Not only that what I thought was just joking between friends was actually hurtful, but also that for over a year he was basically lying to me, pretending like we were still friends. I actually broke down in front of my friends from that. I tried apologizing and saying that I never meant it like that and that I cared for him, but that I felt betrayed as I trusted my friends to be able to talk to me about anything. Like I said, Iâ€™ve always had the fear that my friends donâ€™t really care, then boom it kinda happened. He didnâ€™t really accept my apology and didnâ€™t think I deserved one in return, saying that I was completely in the wrong and he did nothing bad. Nothing really got resolved and we just tried to move on from there, but he no longer showed up for game night. \n\nA couple weeks ago another one of my friends started going off in our group chat that I was being a jerk to John and that I was excluding him from everything and basically abusing him and had no room to ask for an apology. I was at work when this was all going on but when I went through it on my break I almost had a panic attack, and brought back those old fears. I have done nothing to exclude John from our group or anything to attack him. Itâ€™s been a rough couple weeks since then, and itâ€™s been on my mind the entire time. Iâ€™ve already tried to apologize once and it was rejected, plus he doesnâ€™t really care about how I was hurt. AITA for wanting an apology after I was hurt or am I the one who is completely to blame for this?\n\nTL;DR: My friend thinks Iâ€™m bullying him and hides it for over a year, then doesnâ€™t feel bad when my feelings are hurt.",

He had an aversion to commitment, so we never put a label on things. He was constantly drunk, unmotivated, and by month 6, we were both extremely unhappy. He was unemployed out of college, and would not apply for any jobs he saw as below him, like waiting tables. It came out that his dad cheated on his mom. There was a lot going on for him and he seemed to cling to the relationship for stability. \n\nItâ€™s important to note here that Dave and I were friends for 2 years before we dated, and he helped me through quite a bit. So every time I expressed how deeply unhappy I was, heâ€™d beg for two more weeks, insistent that whatever job heâ€™d just applied for would definitely come through and things would get better when he was working, and every time I backed off and agreed to two more weeks. That went on for months before I finally called it off. I developed an attraction to our mutual friend, but out of respect for my quasi-relationship, completely cut contact with said guy as soon as I noticed the attraction. This is important for later.\n\nCome to find out, he lied to me about graduating school. He actually failed out, and thatâ€™s why no jobs were working out. Iâ€™m still pretty angry about this. He had to have known every time he begged for two more weeks that, if he was refusing to apply to jobs that were â€œbelowâ€? him, that he wasnâ€™t going to get a job at all. It was an awful relationship. \n\nSo, remember that friend? Letâ€™s call him Bruce. Bruce and I reconnected after I broke up with Dave. IMPORTANT: 1) I did not meet Bruce THROUGH Dave. I met them independently at the same time about 3 years ago. 2) Bruce and Dave are not particularly close, they were in the same fraternity of 70-some guys, but ran in mostly different circles, with very little overlap. 3) Nothing ever happened between Bruce and I while I was dating Dave, I just noticed I had a crush and stopped talking to or hanging out with Bruce. \n\nBruce and I started dating 3 months after my breakup with Dave. I am incredibly happy, itâ€™s a much better fit and a much healthier relationship. However, some of my shared friends with Dave have been quite cruel, and I ran into Dave at a bar a few weeks ago and he yelled at me quite a bit, stuff about violating â€œgirl codeâ€? and this that and the other. \n\nI donâ€™t think I did anything wrong, but Iâ€™m on the verge of losing friends over this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Dating my ex's friend, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. Friends aren't happy about it. AITA?",

            "input": "Here's a bit of backstory. I work as one of the IT managers for CompanyName in Mexico. 90% of my job requires of me to be in constant communication with our US office, therefore I am fully bilingual, and have a barely noticeable accent. As such, one of my co-workers, whom I didn't really speak with before, asked me to teach her English, so she could improve her own skills set. Apparently, she walked by my office one morning while I was on the phone, and I had left my door open. (irrelevant, but I have been an ESL teacher before)\n\nI agreed to do so, and our first class was to be on a Monday, 1 hour before my shift started. The night before, I spent a good hour and a half preparing a class for her. My daily commute is 2 hours to work, 2 hours back, so being at the office 1 hour earlier was a bit rough, but I am all for people wanting to better themselves, so I didn't mind it. Except she didn't show up. No call, no show.\n\nWhen she finally messaged me throughout the day, she apologized for oversleeping, and re-scheduled me for the next day, at the same time. She showed up 40 minutes late. The next two days she didn't schedule anything with me, and on the last day of the week, she finally showed up on time. This pattern has repeated as a mixed bag for about 7 months. I've gotten to the point of just not showing up whenever I think she won't show up either, and whenever I misjudge it, and she shows up but I don't, I apologize for oversleeping and carry on. I guess it is important to note I am not charging her for it. She stopped scheduling me all together about 4 months ago, but we've kept in touch and I guess we've become office friends. I try not to message her much while at work, or on our personal time. Every other week I'll send her a meme or a bad dad joke I found, but that's about it. She replies in kind. She's confided in me a few of her personal issues, and even made a few passes at me, all of which I blew off and ignored, since I know she has a boyfriend. A couple of months ago, she called me to vent after her breakup.\n\nLast week, she asked me again to help her with her English, and I agreed, but told her that if she was not constant and dedicated to it, there would be no way to improve or learn. She said she was 100% on board with that, and she wanted to start as soon as possible, but she didn't want to do it at the office anymore. She said she'd rather do it over the weekend at some Starbucks or w/e. She said that Sunday (today) would work for her, and we settled on that.\n\nYesterday, at around 1pm I asked her to confirm if we were still on for Sunday. She didn't reply, and I assumed Sunday was off, so I stayed up with my friends all nightp playing videogames. Today, at around 11am, she replied. It started off with her apologizing for not replying to me, then confirming the time and place for today. By noon when I finally got up, I replied, and told her I'd see her then. I asked if she wanted to grab a bite after, and she didn't reply, though the message was read.\n\nAbout 1 hour before we were to meet, she calls me, and cancels on me. Apparently she had JUST rolled her ankle and was on her way to the ER because she \"couldn't even see straight\". I offered to catch up with her at the ER, and she declined.\n\nWIBTA if I just made our relationship as \"coworkers\" only? That is to say, no contact unless it is work related? I feel she is now trying to use me to get her ex jealous or some other shitty deal I want no part of, on top of me being sick of investing time into helping her, when she very clearly has no interest. I don't understand why she'd ask me for help, schedule me, even assist a few classes, and continue to spontaneously cancel. Am I being petty?",

But there was a car in my blind spot I failed to identify and almost caused an accident. Now, Iâ€™m just gona admit that I fucked up here and immediately realized this so I waved my hand at the driver and turn on emergency light and yelled sorry at him. I thought nothing of it and we continue to go straight. Past the light we enter our destination located to our right seperating right turn lane with a V shaped barrier.

My brother on the other hand sold my dad's stuff, gave him money for what my dad paid for it and pocketed the rest. This came to like $15,000. Then he split town a couple weeks later and told me, \"this mess is not my problem and that I owe you nothing.\" My dad's frame of reference is so fucked he thought he made out on this deal.

He just wants to spend time with her, and that's fine. Hell, I've even done the same thing myself, but eventually realized how I may be making others feel and stopped inviting her every time.

In general, this group's communications... are severely lacking. For part 1 of the project I did the vast majority of the work, with the other two only making comments and edits to the document.  \n\n\nPart 2 is now due tomorrow night at midnight. We've had over a month to work on this and had met early in the month to discuss how to get it done, since this isn't something to get done in day or two. However, all three of us are super slammed. For example, I'm in 5 graduate level classes and actively interviewing at a company across the country (read I had a trip in the middle of this) and the other two work full-time and attend full time (3 graduate level classes). So all three of us just kept pushing off this project.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I got back from my job interview trip, I tried to rally the troop's because now we only have 4 days left. One person sends a bunch of potential references (which has been very helpful) and the other has put some notes to consolidate potential ideas. This morning I sent out an e-mail saying effectively, \"Hey guys, we have two days, we have 13-18 pages to write. I've broken it down into sections, here's your sections, let's start getting going on it.\"    \n\n\nI split the work out to me- 60%, person 1- 30%, person 2 -10% based on how my gut tells me they'll actually get done. Since this morning, person 1 did reach out and say \"Ok, but I have another assignment due, so I'll work on it after.\" (Note:  I also have this assignment due and it should only take about 2 hours to complete...) That was now 8 hours ago and there's been no movement on their parts and this person is across the country, so their day is now pretty much shot. Person 2 has not responded since they put the references two days ago.   \n\n\nSo WITBA if I tell let my professor know that at this point, I've done the vast majority of the work for one and from what it seems that I will be the sole author of Part 2?

Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",

So, you don't really know a lot about your needs before you pick. I picked a highly-rated pediatrician (recommended by my OB). I gave birth to an infant with minor issues, so we go to the doctor a lot. \n\nAround the time I gave birth, the pediatrician sold his practice and there were a lot of changes. Email, online appointments and an after-hours advice nurse phone line were discontinued and we were told they would come back once the system switched, but it hasn't in over a year. As a result of everything needing to be conducted by phone, there are long holds every time I call their office...a simple appointment change for a vaccine can take me 30 minutes on the phone. The doctors do not offer call-backs with advice or answers to simple questions -- everything requires an appointment, which is expensive ($150-$270). The front office is also disorganized and once lost our vaccination records. They frequently leave me voicemails reminding me of \"Emily's\" appointment (Not my daughter's name at all!) and call her \"Emily\" in the office (the doctor doesn't do this, just his staff). Recently, there was a change in nurses. The new nurse didn't have a lot of experience. She gave my baby the first of 3 vaccines and got freaked out by the crying and told me, \"I can't do this. I can't do this.\" I told her okay, then we have to get another nurse to do the rest. She said no, she will get fired and then tried to give my baby the 2nd shot and I refused to let her. I made a small scene and insisted the more senior nurse administer the rest of the vaccines. The office staff acted like I'm the Asshole. I complained directly to the doctor and he understood but said he no longer manages his nurses since he sold his practice. He said he would tell my complaint to her manager. AITA on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was frustrated and tried another ped. who had a lab, advice nurse, email, etc. I met with her and did not like her at all. I felt she was dismissive and her style was more rigid than my laid-back former pediatrician. She was also 45 minutes late to our appointment and when I asked the office staff why it was taking so long (sitting in a room full of people with the flu with an infant) they said she was on a personal phone call!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I decided to go back to my former ped.  However, when I called to make my appointment the receptionist, opening her chart (which every office can see everywhere) saw we went somewhere else and told me I am high-maintenance and I \"keep jumping around.\" She said that she will have to ask the pediatrician if he wants to \"take me back.\" I don't see how she can say I keep jumping around when I have only been to 2 pediatricians. Maybe she is referring to when my doctor was on vacation and he scheduled us with his partner. AITA? Is it really not okay to try out new pediatricians?",

Another friend of mine, Brian, recently gave me some money as a gift. I decided I wanted to use it to commission some art from Craig and Kenny, and contacted Craig asking about it. They seemed happy and grateful, and said they'd talk to Kenny about it, but Kenny was sick at the time and so it took a while to get a response. A few days ago, I told Craig what I'd like the art to be of, and they responded, again, they'd check with Kenny to see if that art fit the money I could pay, though it would only be a sketch. I haven't heard from Craig about it again, though that is partly my fault because I didn't bring it up in conversation after that. \n\nJust today, I found another artist on Tumblr. They take commissions as well, and will do more for the same price. I'm considering commissioning them instead, but I would feel bad for canceling on Craig and Kenny when I already told them I'd be buying from them. \n\n**TL;DR Have artist friend, get money, want to commission him and his boyfriend, tell them that, don't hear back about it for a while, find another artist and want to commission them.**",

Truth is, he's struggling, at least from what he's told me. \n\nHe isn't even bad looking, but he's not happy that he keeps getting treated like...a bit of a bitch I guess, from his his own words. He's not respected, and is viewed as friend zone (not even friend zone, more like 'bitch zone', lol). \n\nHe's too nice, effeminate and has no backbone. When he wants to 'get with' a girl, he starts talking to her as he would a friend but comes across as too nice. He'd be a great friend, for sure, but that's now what *he* wants. He wants to be hooking up with girls like his friends are doing at parties.\n\nHe came to me for help, and pleaded me to help. Now I am 5 years his senior, but I've slept with quite a lot of girls while at uni, again, uni is different, but it's pretty clear that my brother looks up to me for this. I gave him some core advice:\n\n- Stop being nice. From now on, you are not a nice guy. I don't care if you have to do a 180 and act like a douchebag, even that is better than being a nice boy. No more nice guy means no more mr effeminate bitch boy. He has to be more masculine (masculinity = good).\n\n- No more talking to girls like friends. You are being dishonest when wanting to befriend girls. You don't even want female friends (and you don't need them, you have male friends). From now on, if a girl tries talking to you, be disinterested and be aloof\n\n- When this works, many girls WILL be attracted to you. Don't get into a relationship, you can do that shit in your 30s. If you want sex, have sex, and then don't text them after\n\n- Main advice: **Don't listen to girls advice, INCLUDING my older sister's advice (26F), we will call her Georgia. Georgia has given him advice on girls and said ''You need to be nice, respectful and considerate, that's all you need''. Obviously this advice has proven useless. I told my younger bro that basically...girls just want a guy who ''gets it'', obviously asking a woman for advice she will give you the wrong advice (unknowingly) because they want the guy to ''just get it''**\n\nNow my bro has implemented my advice and he has slept with 1 girl so far and gotten a blow job from another. Some of the people at school were initially resistant to his new personality, but I said he had to force it. And now after a short while...he got laid, they are now ''re adjusting'' to the new him, and not the bitch boy.\n\nNow the main conflict here is that my sister Georgia knows what I told him and shouted at me saying I am ''filling his mind with crap'' and that I'm a douchebag, but then I said to my sister back ''You don't even care about the kid...he came to you for advice and you gave him half assed crap''. She then told me to fuck off. I don't know why she reacted so strongly, lol, she gave him shit advice. AITA?",

I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now and there have been a string of issues that make me feel like or relationship will only ever be temporary.  This is mostly due to her sexual views which contrast mine.  She is much more open to sex but stays monogamous to me since I am less liberal about it.  She has made clear though that if we are separated, she still needs physical contact.  Which brings me to the incident...\n\nLast summer we were separated for 2 months due to working in different places.  We agreed before hand that if she did anything with someone else, we would follow boundaries and she'd tell me beforehand.  She did not do anything for 7 weeks but then at a party, she got cuddly with a co-worker and they ended up exchanging oral.  Pretty much they cuddled, he fingered her and she blew him.  Though this bothered me immensely, what hurt me the most was that I was trying to contact her through the party and she never responded until afterwards when she told me she did this with another guy.  It was honestly the worst I've ever felt.\n\nWe talked about it and she claimed she didn't consider it sex so she didn't know she should have checked up with me.  But what bothered me was she was outright ignoring me and I saw it as an act of cheating.  However I buried these insecurities and have been with her for another 4 months with no problems.\n\nBut I still think about this a lot and I could never see myself spending my life with her because of it.  There's a chance we'll be separated again this summer and I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to give her the option of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up.  Maybe I'm looking for more general advice but I could only think of this sub.  Thanks for the feedback.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend did something id consider cheating.  Wondering if I'd be an asshole to give her an ultimatum of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up",

Most of these dogs are 50 lbs or more but my dog is a little over 20. There has never been an issue with my dog's smaller size, and the other dogs have been great with him. My dog is a little annoying when he barks/howls (beagle) but only does it when he's playing, it is sometimes ear piercing, but when he gets too wild I pull him aside and give him a little \"timeout\" because I know it can get annoying for other dog owners, but they say it isn't that bad.\n\nWhen I do have my dog on a leash, he wears a harness, this apparently was an open invitation to said neighbor to pick him up by the harness. The first time I didn't say anything, the second time I told him not to do that, and the third time he did it is when I lost my patience. Now to describe this guy, he's on the Board at my HOA. He's a little arrogant, he always has to be right, always trashing on neighbors and dishing their issues, stuff like that. He's a little older than the average age of people who let their dogs play, we're in our late 20s-mid thirties, this guy is in his 50s. We don't hate him but more or less we tolerate him.\n\nWell during this situation, there was about 5 of us out there with our dogs, my dog was howling and I tried to calm him down a bit, once I let him go the Board member picked him up off the ground by harness and yelled at him and called him a little shit. I walked over, grabbed my dog, and told him to never touch my dog again. I got in his face and asked what the fuck his problem was. I never shoved/touched him, but I let it be known I do not appreciate my dog being treated like that, I will discipline my own dog. I would never treat anyone else's dog like that unless he was attacking another dog or another person (which my dog never would, any sign of aggression from another dog he just rolls over on his back wagging his tail).\n\nBM tries to play off the situation as he was \"just playing around\" and I told him no one else here would ever do that to my dog, and I would never do that to theirs. He tried to make me out like I was the asshole, like I'm the dick for getting mad at him for doing that even after I told him not to. He consistently disrespects others and thinks he's untouchable because he knows people don't want to start shit with board members. I don't know if he's that arrogant and just doesn't give a fuck, or actually that disconnected from reality where he can do whatever he wants without repercussions. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry and pissed off at him?

She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob.

I'm a university student living with my boyfriend of four years in a small apartment, with two small rescue dogs. We don't have a whole lot of money, but we can live comfortably as long as we don't waste our money. Because of this, when me and my partner decided to get a dog last year, we chose adoption over buying a puppy (there were a few reasons along with money, such as wanting to rehome an unfortunate dog and also, we wanted to have a slightly older dog that was more adjusted to kids). We went to the shelter and found two beautiful boston terrier girls. They are both two years old and sisters, like my daughters were at the time, they had been around kids in their first home and really seemed perfect, so we got both of them. They are amazing and we love them so much, the kids love them and the dogs are really well behaved. \n\nBecause we have a two bedroom apartment and not a whole lot of space/money, my boyfriend and I donated and sold the baby clothes as the girls grew out of them, keeping only the sentimental pieces. However, we fell a little bit behind somewhere and ended up sorting through quite a lot of 0-6 month clothes that we left at the back of a closet. Now, my sister in law has recently found out she's pregnant. Her and her husband are really well off and had a son a few years ago who was dressed head to toe in designer clothes from birth. I didn't think they'd struggle for clothes. My boyfriend suggested we could give the clothes to his sister when she found out she's pregnant at a family meal, where my SIL was in attendance, but everyone sort of laughed it off so I thought nothing more about it. \n\nFast forward a month or so, we finally get round to sorting the baby clothes. My husband and I had bought the dogs some matching sweaters setting us back Â£20, so I had the grand idea to start cutting and sewing the clothes into dog sweaters and onesies for them to sleep in through the winter. My boyfriend thought this was a great idea, the girls loved seeing the dogs in their old clothes and it was super cute. I posted pics of them on instagram, and basically got a snarky text from my sister in law about how she'd have to be buying a new wardrobe then. I took it as a joke, and sent her a few more pictures of the dogs thinking she was being silly, and she kicked off. MIL started kicking off too. Next thing I know, my SIL is posting on Facebook marketplace asking for cheap/free baby clothes. \n\nSo, AITA for assuming my SIL would buy her own baby clothes when she didn't seem too pleased to have mine/dressed her first baby fully designer? As far as I know they haven't had a change in income, but am I wrong for assuming?",

Iâ€™m the opposite and this is not a big deal for me, but this is important later. He is strong to the point that heâ€™s cocky about it. He has a lot of personal issues that people call him out on, and this has caused his friends to realize that he cannot accept that he is wrong. However, he is still a pretty good person.\n\nI am not strong and I donâ€™t know what would happen if I was in a threatening physical situation. I was also raised near NYC. My father was a police officer and has always told me that, for my own safety, I should never engage with anyone on the street. You never know what might happen. Last year, I was in a situation with my male friend and my boyfriend that involved a homeless person approaching us and targeting me. He started cursing at me and the situation could have gotten physical had my boyfriend not driven away. After we were safe, I told them that this is why we should not engage with homeless people. I get that not all of them are dangerous, but I do not want to be involved as I am scared of what might happen. My boyfriend agreed with me and respects my wishes. My friend, however, laughed and said that heâ€™s going to do whatever he wants if Iâ€™m there or not.\n\nFlash forward a few months. Said friend and I go on a class trip to a city in Europe. While we are there, he insists on engaging with every single homeless person he meets. He even goes to ATMs to withdraw money, exchanges information with them, and does whatever they ask. I told him that this made me uncomfortable, and he told me that I should just keep walking by myself if I didnâ€™t want to do that with him.\n\nI told him that Iâ€™m concerned for his safety as well as my own; weâ€™re in a foreign country and we have no means of defending ourselves. Itâ€™s one thing if weâ€™re home, but this doesnâ€™t seem safe. He claims that he can defend himself and that itâ€™s his duty as a Christian to give to every homeless person. He claims that he has never had a bad experience, so nothing could happen with these people. He also implied that I am not a good Christian because of this. It got so bad that one of the people he gave money to saw him on a street again, called him out by his first name, and asked for even more.\n\nI am not against helping the homeless, but you canâ€™t know what might happen. This is why I do not engage with anyone I encounter. Iâ€™d rather be safe and help by volunteering at a shelter. Iâ€™m not asking him to stop, but if weâ€™re hanging out and I canâ€™t leave, I would prefer if he did not do it because I do not feel safe. Weâ€™ve been in situations where this has backfired, but he simply does not listen. Iâ€™m guessing that some people are just going to tell me to leave the situation when he does this, but in most cases I am unable to do so. I also donâ€™t want to just not hang out with him, as this does not happen often and heâ€™s still my friend. AITA?",

I love her kids with my entire life and I work very hard to make sure they never go without anything they need. Sometime last year she had asked me if I could take her two oldest children (teenagers at the time) to live with me so that they can attend a better school district. I immediately accepted, (even though I was only 21 at the time I had moved out at an early age and had managed to rent a house so I can accommodate two people). Everything was great, my niece and nephew are a joy to have around and they were old enough were i didnâ€™t have to worry about cooking or cleaning up after them too much. \n\nThe problem started about a month after them staying over, although I rent a home, I do not own it, I do not have â€œhouseâ€? money, I work hard and budget well and never live beyond my means because if I didnâ€™t I would not be able to afford it and she knew that but she did not offer to help with her kids expenses at ALL. She never offered to help pay for food, toiletries or anything else they might need. I lived on my own, $30 worth of groceries could last me a week and half but $80 of food could be done within five days with two teenagers!! And I knew that bringing it up to her again would only cause a fight and the last thing I wanted to do was to make the kids think they were causing any issues. They are not the problem, they gotta eat, they need clothes etc, I was just disturbed that she wouldnâ€™t help me knowing that I was taking them in as a favor to her and that I am not making a lot of money.\n\nI worked two jobs at that point to be able to cover all the expenses. Iâ€™m not gonna lie, being a 21 year old girl responsible for two teenagers, all the bills of the house, plus maintenance of the house (mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, cleaning the bathrooms) and two full time jobs, it was getting to me and I smoked weed in my free time to help me relax. Weed has never interfered with my work ethic or with my responsibilities. Ive never called off or missed bills due to lack of money spent on drugs so it shook me to my core when my sister found out I was smoking and immediately went to my landlord to try and kick me out. She said she didnâ€™t want me around her (grown) kids because I was going to get them addicted and show them to be lazy and bummy, I completely shut her out after that. I donâ€™t talk to her when I see her at family events anymore and I live my life for the most part like I donâ€™t have a sister. I still am in close contact with my niece and nephews and I see them rather frequently but itâ€™s almost always in secret which feels shitty and like Iâ€™m missing out on a closer relationship with them because of her views.

He runs two other businesses and simply did not reply because 1. He is not her manager and 2. He did not find her excuse for her time off to be justified after just having that conversation and not being notified of the time off then. I called her the next day to see what she needed the time off for but before I could even ask her she said she was busy and needed to go. I was watching her on the cameras and it was not busy. Now it is a week later, the week of the time needed off, and she text me (Hasnâ€™t text me in 2 weeks) saying that because I did not give her an answer to get her license fixed she no longer needs the time off because flights are too expensive. How should I respond? I feel like an ass hole but I also feel like that sheâ€™s trying to make me feel that way. \n\nTLDR: after my employee offered to pick up shifts for her coworker with cancer she asked her non manager for 3 days off and avoided her actual manager then the week of vacation told the actual manager she no longer needs time off because the manager took too long to respond.

Her parents live out of state, and when they've visited in the past, she's let them stay at her place to be closer, and to save money. Whenever this has happened, she's given them her bed, opting to sleep on a couch or extra mattress herself.\n\nWe're in the process of moving in together (into a 1br) and will be sharing a bed and bedroom. Recently, the topic of her parents visiting came up, and at some point during this conversation it came out that she would want to give them our bed and bedroom, and have us sleep on the couch or an air mattress in the living room.\n\nThis had honestly not occurred to me and I said that I wasn't comfortable with that. Turns out we both have strong feelings about this but are both struggling to articulate why.\n\nIn listening to my girlfriend, I've learned that she views it as an essential part of being a good host to go the extra mile for your guest's comfort, potentially even sacrificing your own. She especially doesn't like the idea of having people who are a little older in anything but an actual bed (especially her parents). It sounds like a respect thing for her, and how she was raised.\n\nMy point of view is that while I'm very supportive of her parents visiting and want them to come, and want to host them in our home and make arrangements for their comfort, I'm just not comfortable giving up my bed to them. To me my bed is a very private and personal place for only me and my GF. Letting someone sleep there, especially with me in the other room, would feel weird to me, putting aside some practical matters like it would make having personal space in my home and getting to my clothes more difficult and honestly, a little awkward. I guess I just have some possessive weirdness around beds!\n\nMy proposed compromise is to invest in a really good air mattress and bedding so that we can still comfortably put them up in our place and they won't have to get a hotel, but she is not that enthusiastic about this solution. She really wants them to have our bed.\n\nThis hasn't really caused a rift between us, but I've been surprised at how strong our opinions are on this, leading me to second guess myself and wonder if I'm just being unreasonable.

I was literally planning on doing this today, and was using it as a reason for me to get dressed/ready so I could go into town and carry out some other tasks. But it just threw my whole day off and I lost all motivation to even get dressed (I'm also diagnosed with depression, so I try and set myself tasks to help me get up at the weekend). He noticed my mood was off, and asked what was the matter and I explained how it makes me feel as if my opinions don't matter if anything I say seems to be ignored.\n\nGo to this evening, dad comes in and said a neighbour is just borrowing my jump leads (which I keep in my car). Note, he's not asking IF someone can borrow them. Just that they ARE. I mean the answer would obviously be yes, if he'd asked, but he didn't. And considering the conversation we had literally earlier today I just loose all fight and don't see any point in bringing it up anymore. I have had the same conversation both parents so many times before.\n\nMy question is I am the asshole for getting irritated at my dad for taking my car and other things even when it's sometimes to do something useful (like fix the radio) when I have explicitly asked him not too several times?\n\nI think I am a bit sensitive about my car as well (it's not new or anything) because it's the only thing outside of the house that I can really call mine. And I love driving it to work.\n\n\nDL:DR I am the asshole for over reacting when my dad helps me out and takes my car without asking me first.",

I've wanted to be a mom my whole life but right now, I'm only 17 (just turned 17 a few weeks ago) and need to focus on school and working my part time job to save up for my first apartment, so I don't know that much about caring for babies. One day, my mom's friend, let's call her E, comes up to me and says, \"Hey - my name- wanna make a quick few bucks?\" I say yes because I was running low on money and I didn't want to have to dip into my savings to help my mom pay rent. (She's a single mom who can't work because if she works her medical will be revoked and each bottle of insulin she need to survive is around $300, so we're basicly able to pay for rent, food, and that's it, and sometimes things come up to where we might be late for rent) E tells me that she wants to take my mom out  and that I need to watch her baby for two hours and that she will be back here to get her at exactly midnight. E told me that she'll put the baby down to sleep before she leaves and I thought \"this should be easy\" by the time 2:00 am rolls around I'm having an extreme panic attack because the baby is crying and I don't know what's wrong (Not the greatest with kids and don't know that much on how to care for them, remember?) I've tried calling my mom 20 times and left 15 voicemails, and tried calling E a few times but it just went straight to voicemail. At 2:30 ish, E comes and gets the baby and leaves. The next day, I hear both E and her boyfriend calling me stupid and irresponsible for not knowing how to take care of a baby like they did when at my age they were already parents and were forced to know those things. Now when I talk to either E or her boyfriend they act like I'm a huge incontinence on everything. The reason I couldn't get should of my mom was because her phone was in her purse inside the bar while my mom was outside yelling at E to go home to get her baby. If you have any questions about the night ask, but am I and my mom the assholes here?",

He explained that I keep him up at night when talking on discord or listening to an audio book before going to sleep (unless I'm sleeping in the same room as someone I prefer not to wear headphones when I go to sleep).

We talked about it for a bit, and decided to offer to let them rent the house off of us for just the mortgage price -- without us making any money from the deal.\n\nOne thing led to another and the friends ended up moving in early. We're still not due to move until the summer, but they moved in back in January. We agreed to let them, and only charged rent -- no utilities since we have decent jobs, trying to be nice,\n\nThroughout their staying here (at the time of this writing it's been a little over two months), one came to us asking if she could get a dog. We own three dogs ourselves, so we really didn't see the harm. My wife and I have 3 medium-sized dogs so it was surprising when she got a very large Husky.\n\nThis dog is huge. The door to her room is now scratched all-to-pieces where the dog wants to be out. The dog also destroyed the backyard and the screen on our back window. I will admit that some of it was probably from my dogs as well. They're not entirely innocent.\n\nMy other friend felt as if she was incredibly lonely. Not having a pet, she requested if she could get an animal. She wanted a cat and we declined because my wife is allergic to cats. After a while of discussion she ended up talking us into it. Honestly, my wife and I are pushovers.\n\nI work from home. Saying that, I'm home a huge portion of the day. Our friends are at college or just out hanging out with their other friends until 11:30-12. So, everyday we sit at home all day having to hear the cat's cry all day nonstop. Neither of us can show it attention seeing as how she's allergic and I would have to scrub down/change clothes anytime I came in contact with it.\n\nHusky friend has also had her boyfriend staying here for the entire month. He doesn't really do anything. He's just living here using up the utilities that my wife and I are paying for. Initially when it was brought to my attention that he was coming, it was for the weekend. I feel like this is slightly unfair to my wife and myself since we're having to spend even more money on utilities.\n\nMy wife and I are still the ones buying the toiletries, dish soap, laundry detergent, pretty much any consumable used in the house.

            "input": "Backstory:  Started dating at 17.  A month later she tried to break up with me while I thought things were going well.  I drove to her house in the middle of the night to find out what she was so upset about.  Turns out that she was pregnant.  We had only started having sex a couple of weeks prior.  My naive dumb ass asked if it was mine and of course it turns out she's pregnant by one of the biggest losers in school, her ex-boyfriend whom she dumped after realizing what a piece of shit he was.  \n\n(Side note, this dude has 4 kids;  my step-daughter, her half-brother (adopted by a new awesome father), a child with down syndrome whom he had with this 40+yo wife who died in a car accident, and another girl who got pregnant and ran to Washington state to get away from him.)\n\nI digress.  The entire pregnancy was a nightmare.  The father would stir up drama every chance he got and caused nothing but problems.  Tried to fight me at the NICU she was in for 3 months as she was born 2 months early, started rumors at school, confronted me, etc.  My father-in-law sat us both down and gave us this talk:  \"Life is about pussy. . .\" basically made us shake hands and agree to be gentleman.  That didn't last long as he started stalking us.  Also, while it was his weekend with the baby, we would see him at the mall by himself or with friends and no baby.  When asked, of course his parents were watching her.  Fast forward many years of compulsive lying and general neglect, HE CALLS CPS...ON US.  Told his doctor we were putting cigarettes out on her which was in no shape or form true in any way.  She's a \"picker\" and had picked some bug bites or whatever and of course when you pick your wounds they look worse.  She still does it today.  We decided after all the drama and all the pain he's caused our beloved daughter that he didn't deserve to see her anymore.  The child support payments stopped immediately.  It's now been 7 years without a single payment, but this isn't about him. \n\nMy wife is a type 1 diabetic with multiple complications as a result of her not taking care of herself.  We have struggled to get her on any kind of insurance or coverage that would help her with her diabetes.  While I was in the Army, she had Tricare which was awesome and even left us with 6 months of supplies after the fact which was a life saver.  Her complications go from being like 90% blind (maybe worse, eye appointment upcoming) - can't read the big E on the eye chart to missing toes to nerve damage to diabetic gastroparesis.  We are days apart (age 31) and she's suffering badly.  Now, all that being said, she doesn't check her blood sugar regularly, doesn't take insulin properly, prefers to have a blood sugar &gt;200 as opposed to 100-200 where it's supposed to be because being \"low\" feels so much worse than a blood sugar high.  Food?  Psh.  Anything fried or covered in sugar is her favorite.  Donuts, french fries, burgers, anything sweet that isn't chocolate.  I KNOW I don't help.  My diet sucks, I eat fast food constantly and I'm a little overweight and I love the sweets too.  Here's the difference:  I know I eat like shit and I want to change it.  I've made several attempts to change my diet and excersize more only to fail over and over again.  I've managed to stick to a \"low-carb, high vegetable, low-fat\" diet for a few weeks at a time, during which she is AWFUL.  Complains constantly, never stops talking about ice cream or gummy bears.  When we were short on time one evening, I said \"Hey, I'm going to burger king to get a salad...do you want one?\" - trying to at least nudge her in the general right direction.  'No, get me the triple double bacon with cheese and extra fries with a giant diet coke'.  I've tried this HUNDREDS of times to convince her to eat right.  Here's the thing, she's beautiful, gorgeous and FAR from fat.  I'm not trying to get her to eat right so she'll lose weight, I'm trying to get her to eat right to save her fucking life.  We've accumulated probably over $1,000,000 in hospital bills due to 9-10 emergency room visits a year.  When she gets sick, they usually keep her in the hospital at least a week and the recovery at home can be 2-4 weeks at which point the cycle starts over again where she's getting sick in that timeframe and right back in the hospital with an infection, DKA, gastroparesis symptoms, etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started couples counseling last year but it only lasted a couple of months.  I started therapy and seeing a medications-provider (pyschiatrist) at the same time.  I have VA care so I can use all the healthcare options they have available including couples counseling but it does not include my wife's personal care.  During counseling last year (\\~May 2018) our counselor asked to give our relationship 2 more months during counseling.  We did all kinds of \"homework\" like remembering how we felt when we were first together and all this emotional stuff, but, I don't think she understood(the therapist).  I LOVE my wife.  Deeply, strongly and faithfully.  I've never been unfaithful and I tell her everything.  She's the only person in the world I can literally be myself around and she won't hate me for it, at least that's how I feel.  But, I don't know if I explained everything right or what, but, my problems with my wife are tangible REAL problems, not emotional ones.  It was always difficult to get her in the mood for sex but now that she's been sick(3 years now), it's stopped pretty much completely.  When it DOES happen, it's awful for both of us.  I know that sex isn't everything so I've looked past that.  I've asked her at least 1,000 times to do any of the following:  A)  Get a job, go to work, do something.  B)  Apply for college, go back to school, get some student loans, etc.  C)  Apply for disability.  If you're too sick to work, then you must be disabled.  With disability and/or a job comes health insurance, with health insurance you can see the doctors you need to see.  With doctors comes the inevitable healthier lifestyle and therefore positive changes in her health.  I gave the counselor the two months she asked for and I thought HARD about my relationship for months, I'm still thinking about it.  That August, I told my wife that I had made my decision and I wanted to separate.  I told her that I wanted our daughter to finish 6th grade before we split up the family.  She just started middle school and is in band for the first time and she's really been struggling to find herself this year.  I love our daughter as much as I love my wife.  I have asked and begged and pleaded my wife not to take her away from me like we did her biological father.  She swears she's going to let me continue being her \"dad\" forever.  I have every intention of taking care of her until I'm incapable of doing so.  Here's the dad thing too - we've lost 2 babies to miscarriage and had 1 early pregnancy loss during our 10+year relationship.  I have no biological children and that bothers me a lot.  She knows and we've NEVER used protection, birth control, nor have I ever really pulled out.  We know that we SHOULDN'T have more children because it would endanger her life but she wanted to give me a child and I wanted to give her one.  Fortunately, now, that never happened.  It now appears that we will never conceive a child of our own nor will she ever DO ANYTHING with her life nor will she ever be able to drive herself again nor will she be able to take care of her own daughter by herself.  In the last 2 years she's missed Halloween, Christmas, first period, Thanksgiving...and more that I can't think of, because she was in the hospital.    \n\n\nI don't blame her for being a diabetic, I don't blame her for all of the things that \"just happened\" to her.  I DO, however, blame her for her poor choices in taking care of herself.  I DO blame her for NOT CARING ENOUGH about her own life to get herself right for our daughter.  I have a small glimmer of hope, less than 1% chance, that she'll let our daughter stay with me when we separate.  I gave her almost an entire year to figure something out and here we are, 3 months away from the date that was set and she's WORSE now than last year instead of better.    \n\n\nTL;DR:  Type 1 diabetic wife doesn't take care of herself, has serious complications from it, has no intentions of fixing anything or getting healthier and has been quoted as saying \"I just want to get her to 18\" (our daughter).  I'm letting her stay with me and I'm still taking care of her until May when we \"separate\" - probably followed by divorce.    \n\n\nAITA?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is really hard for me to post because I have anxiety really bad and I think everyone is going to be angry at me.  I'm not a bad person, just in a bad situation and I don't see any other solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I thought I wasnâ€™t a part of the tension until now.\n\nOne of my roommates, H, has been sort of annoying about cleaning. She is a clean freak except doesnâ€™t clean her stuff up to the same standard she holds others to. Stuff like leaving banana peels, dirty dishes, and other trash on the counter, but getting mad about the trash not being taken out or the floors not being swept. As a result, weâ€™ve made a chore chart of sorts to determine who does what when. \n\nImportantly for this, I am almost never at the apartment except to sleep and shower, as I work 30 hours a week along with going to class. I pretty much never use dishes, and when I do I clean them up immediately.

I took this as patronizing, as we had already discussed our roles regarding chores and I have been doing my jobs.\n\nI responded: â€œH, i understand your concern and will work to be better, however iâ€™ve been following the chart for cleaning and i donâ€™t even use dishes more than once every two weeks. i want to emphasize that i am just as invested as you all are in making sure there isnâ€™t tension.  things have been really tense in the apartment lately and to be completely honest iâ€™m kind of confused as to why. that being said, please tell me if you have anything you think i need to work on. however, H, i really donâ€™t appreciate being literally @â€˜ed when it comes to something like this. i may be misinterpreting as it is easy to do via text, but that sounded super patronizing.â€? \n\nH gets offended by this and then says I shouldnâ€™t be offended by communication when I just said I was open to being â€œcalled outâ€?.  She then continued by saying that she doesnâ€™t get what the big deal is and that she doesnâ€™t feel comfortable in her own\n\n Iâ€™m upset because I wasnâ€™t under the impression I had said anything wrong, but Hâ€™s response has me feeling like I have.

Like lets say you started a company with someone, but you didnt know them that well, youd give them equity gradually after theyve been with the company awhile. That way they dont just claim ownership and then leave the first week without contributing.\n\nIn this case the CTO of my company had a vesting schedule of 4 years, with his cliff at 1 year. So this means if he is with the company a year, he immediately receives 25% of his equity. So if his equity is 20%, he receives 5% ownership right there. Then for the next 3 years he gets equity every month, gradually until he gets all of it after 4 years. Thats how its supposed to work.\n\nNow, if you dont make it to the cliff for whatever reason, you get nothing.\n\nSo now that that is explained, I am the COO of a startup headed into series a funding. The CTO is someone whose been with the company for 10 months. The issue is, he doesnt have much in the way of qualifications or education. I mean he is educated but theres nothing special or unique on his resume besides one small project before us and our project.\n\nThe investment group interested in funding us is trying to free up as much equity as possible, so theyre looking to trim the fat and prevent issues down the line. We are of the opinion that they want a superstar genius as CTO. The CEO of my company, along with the CVO both met with me to discuss cutting the CTO loose before his cliff.\n\nHe would basically leave with nothing after 10 months of work. They asked for my input and I recommended firing him and replacing him with someone with a wider skillset and a better pedigree.\n\nI am the one who broke the news. He did not take it well obviously as we did basically deny him potentially millions of dollars down the line and a high paying job to boot. He also lost any claim on his prior work, naturally.\n\nAITA? Should I have kept him through his cliff?",

Latest I've ever gotten in the house was 1:30am the one night I was at a concert.\n\nSo fast forward to start of this week, I'm working part time at the government agency where I had an internship with and more than 2 weeks out from FE exam and feeling good about it. I was an RA during college and a few of my old residents invite me to see their play production at the local campus on Thursday.

However, whenever I bring up conversation about things I'm interested in or currently working on at the moment (we're both artistic and love trying new medias) she kinda of gives half-assed responses. I get that talking about certain things with no shared interests can kinda be dull, but maybe I'm wrong in thinking she should at least try to sound anything but bored or annoyed? \n\n        Anyway, this isn't just some topics. Every morning now when we see each other, whatever convo we have, if it's something I'm talking about she just gives off this annoyed look. \n\n  I also go to her for advice occasionally, because I have like two friends that are girls while the rest of my friend group are guys. So I go to her for advice on girl stuff, or just life advice because she can be really keen on giving good advice. \n   \n  For the past few months though, when I go to her she again responds with an annoyed tone. She says 'I don't know' or 'Dont ask me' for everything. I get not knowing what to say but when it's said like I'm being an annoyance it pushes me away. \n\n She comes to me for advice too, which I'm fine with. I try to answer with my honest opinion and what I believe is the best advice from my POV. We're both seniors in highschool, adulthood is around the corner. The two of us have matured, however she acts very childish if the advice is not what she wants to hear. She proceeds to get annoyed and just end our conversation right then and there.  \n\n When she's talking about her projects and current happenings I try my best to actively listen and engage with her. But lately I'm not feeling it. If she can't return an small interest in my life hapenings then I just feel that I should distant myself from her, especially after we graduate.

While it's not all the time, she is listening more and generally being interested in what I conversate with her. She's not completely done with showing indifference and annoyance but I have noticed a difference, which is what I could ask for for a start. \n\n ",

My service was very new : 6-7 LGBT roommates in 1 apparent volunteering in different schools by day and working with LGBT youth organisation in the afternoon.\nIn my first year I loved working at the school,the teachers were great and the students and I had great connection.I learned a lot about the special education world and wanted to go to uni for it once my service was done.\nI did not like working for the organisation at all. I liked working with the youth and help them in any way I can,but the people responsible for it were completely unprofessional and went as far as cancelling a seminar I worked on for months a month before it was due.\nWe have one person who represents the organisation,she was horrible. and another person(V) who is responsible for the school project- she was a sweetheart.\n\nThe story itself :\nThis was in the beginning of my second year,I was frustrated with the organisation but stayed because I loved working at the school.

I didn't show up for an organisation seminar because of my medical condition and she made a whole fuss about it because \" we are one apartment and should represent the same things,and if you don't like the organisation,why aren't you leaving??\" I told her I like the education part but she kept asking me this until we had a fight where I told her its none of her business why im here and i was here before her.\nIt went like this for the whole year,other roomates decided to stop talking with her altogether because she was constantly trying to boss them around,we couldn't tell non PC jokes to each other without her triggering and fighting with us,she tried to force people and tell them their mental problems because \"it will bring us closer\" and was just an overall bitch to everyone who disagreed with her.I once told my friend a joke with the word \" butch\" in it and Z heard it-so she went around telling my friends that I'm a misogynist..it cost me in a loss of some friends.\na whole year of being policed at your house wasn't fun,she was always looking for a way for her to \"educate\"us which came across as very condescending - I don't need her lectures about how horrible I am for eating meat and not caring about the organisation. She never helped us clean and always left dirty dishes around the house- when we brought them to her room and left it there she cried and told us she will complain to V (V knew she was problematic but couldn't kick her out)\n\nSo,the big fight :\nWe were supposed to clean the apartment,I came home early and it was only her there. I wanted to rest because I has a rough day,I asked her id she wanted to help me clean some stuff &amp; wash the floor  and she agreed.\nWhen I put some stuff in the other room,she decided that \"because I put them in an angry way, I'm mad at her so she won't help me\"\nAfter a whole year of hearing this kind of bs from her I've had enough,I yelled at her that she tries to be a victim and she went to her room.\nI started to wash the floor by myself and she came back and just sat in the living room full of water not even trying to help.\nI asked her \" why are you such a bitch?\" \nShe started screaming - calling me disgusting but I yelled back \" no shut the fuck up alredy,this is why no one in your last apartment liked you,and everyone here hates you and I can't wait until you leave and I won't have to see your ugly face again you fucking bitch!\" \nand I stormed off leaving the floor wet.\nI did end up apologizing because I was harsh on her,it was just frustrating to always be criticised in your  house and not being able to make it stop despite asking.\n\nSo Reddit..AITA for what I said to her\n\n",

He is the oldest of 7 kids and takes on the 'big brother' role.  My boyfriend, we'll call him B, has asked me to let his brother move in with us again and I don't want him to.  Here's the backstory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the 4 1/2 years of us being together, we have had 3 siblings live with us.  Sibling 1 lived with us for 6 months.  Sibling 2 lived with us for 8 months, got kicked out, he talked me into letting her come back and she stayed another 6 months.  Sibling 3 stayed with us for 4 months and was doing his parole with us, is back in prison now and is wanting to complete his house arrest/parole with us.  Last time sibling 3 stayed with us it was horrible for me- he was manipulative, lying, had no respect for our property and even tried to break B and I up, broke all the house rules, tried sneaking in his gfs all the time...etc.  It was an awful situation for everyone, it was always a fight with him and it seemed never-ending.  Now B says that he feels bad for me and how I was feeling during that time and swears this time will be different and he'll put his foot down etc etc- but I have a pretty good understanding of his personality by now- Sibling 3 is the way he is and I don't feel like having to parent a grown man (he's 28)  just so he doesn't throw a temper tantrum. Countless instances have happened and I do not feel the need to list every single one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I bring up that I would be miserable with him living there B says that yeah it's awful but no one else will take him, since he burned bridges with everyone, and I don't understand because I am not from a big family.  Then he goes on to say that he would feel responsible if he went back to jail and someone needs to look after him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am about to graduate next year and would love to have a life with just me and B, without his siblings living there and the headache that they bring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to say that he's grown and responsible for his own actions/life?

The husband is a big drinker but I figured if it was just us and them it wouldn't be too big of a deal. They just had a baby. I did expect them to drink but I didn't think it would be everyone getting sloppy. Well my GF told me after we accepted the invite that two of the husbands friends and his parents are going. They are all big drinkers. I've heard stories about their family get togethers and they sound a lot like when I would drink, everyone gets sloppy and behaves obnoxiously. Had I known they were going initially I would have declined. For a few days I was trying to find a way to tell my gf I didn't want to go but couldn't. I am a bit ashamed honestly.

I slept on the couch and we've barely spoken. She texted me saying since im not going I  need to take the Friday before off so she can ride with them.  Im not going to. It would put a financial burden on me, since I'm the breadwinner at home and pay most of our bills. This was also not discussed when we first talked about going or I would have said no.

He pretty much sucks the air out of any room he's in so that he can talk about himself.  He's an \"actor-writer\" (a.k.a. a waiter) so he's obsessed with self-promotion, and he seems to see people strictly as tools to talk about himself.  If we're grabbing coffee, he'll talk the barista's ear off about his writing as if the barista were Scott Rudin in disguise. If I go away on vacation, he tells me to bring something back for him without even saying please. When I get back, he doesn't ask how the trip was, he just says \"Don't forget to bring me my chocolate!\" When someone else gets a compliment, he does this whole self-pity thing where he fishes for an equal, if not greater, compliment.\n\nI tried to let it slide and force myself to enjoy his company, when all of a sudden, I couldn't take it anymore. I realized how much I dreaded being around him. I couldn't ignore how embarrassed I was to have him around my other friends. There is a profound, fundamental self-centeredness about this person that is truly shocking. I admit that I am an idiot for letting it go on this long and not having a spine, but I try to be nice, and I always convince myself that I can be obliging and self-sacrificial and patient. But I'm...not. \n\nSo the next time we ran into each other, I was cold. So cold that even *he* noticed. Once I get to a certain point, I'm incapable of hiding my emotions. I told him how I don't even feel like a person around him, just a tool. He mostly talked about himself and his own feelings, asked for examples of when he was self-centered (Examples? Every time! Every word!) When I gave examples, he had an excuse for each of them. \n\nBut he also said he wants to do better as a friend. I don't think he's capable of it--his narcissism seems marrow-deep. He asked me what he could do to make things better which I guess is an appropriate thing to say but, coming from him, just seemed to be more of his \"Figure out this labor for me so that I don't have.\"\n\nI get the feeling that, best case scenario, he'll hide his selfishness long enough to repair our \"friendship\" and then revert back to who he is at his core as soon as he can. Worst case scenario, I have to walk him through the whole process of pretending to care about other people and it'll be just as exhausting, but in a different way. \n\nAm I a bad person for suddenly bringing up all these issues, dropping him out of the blue, and for not giving him a second chance? Looking back, I don't know how the friendship lasted this long (actually, I do--I repressed a lot of feelings!) but I don't think I can go back. I don't like being mean or cutting friends, though. ",

Well his girlfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out because they were talking about how she's not 100% happy in her marriage and how he was going to come through and see her while he was on his haul. He's a truck driver. Anyway she got into it with his girlfriend and I understand that she lives in a remote area but she could find better things to do with her time then stirring up drama with other people.\n\nShe's saying someone shared screenshots with her ex's girlfriend about stuff that she was saying. I told her to talk to me about something else that she had posted about on Facebook last night while I said that she could. Then she comments I would suspend I need to know that you're not the one that was sharing the screenshots with his girlfriend. I said first of all I would never do that and secondly it hurts me that you would think I would do that to you because you're family.\n\nWhat I really wanted to say to her was well maybe if you stop stirring up drama you wouldn't have these problems. If you know that a man is attached then leave him alone ex or not. Especially because he's an ex. I feel that she has nothing better to do but the spend her days engaged in bullshit and drama with other people. I can totally understand her ex's girlfriend being upset. \n\nBut yet she seems to think that she's not in the wrong here. First of all I feel like she is doing stuff behind her husband's back that she wouldn't want him knowing about it and secondly she's holding her ex's girlfriend responsible when in reality it's her fault. Also, I'm not too happy because it seems like she's not spending enough time worried about her kids and instead is worried about what everyone on Facebook is doing. Stop worrying about that Facebook drama and start spending more time with your kids.\n\nMy niece is four and I suspect that she may be autistic. It seems like not enough is being done to help her. I mean I don't know because she lives two hours away but from what I'm hearing from other family members and what she's posting on Facebook she's not addressing this like she should be.

I also was \"friends\" with a few other people who they knew. According to them in the past, I had really helped a few of them, even apparently saving the life of one of them (planned suicide). The problem is, I have a lot of serious issues with depression and suicide myself and so many times I could be a bit of a downer, but I never tried to complain about my problems to them, and I always avoided telling them about my past and my struggles. This is where it gets complicated.\n\nI'll split this into a few parts for each person.\n\nMy best friend, who we'll call Apple. I met Apple about a year ago, and we gradually became best friends. Apple was the first person I trusted in a long time and my first real friend. We helped eachother in times of need and I think gave everything I could to help make them feel better. However, as of late I imagine I have been rather judgemental, due to my own personal struggles. It was frustrating and confusing to see my \"friends\" getting better and happier and me still being the same person, lonely and self-destructive. Of course, I didn't tell anyone this, but when Apple told me they had a date, I may have reacted in an... unfavourable way. I didn't say anything inherently rude, but I think I came off as a little salty and jealous. Shortly after this, Apple asked me what was wrong , and I told them it was none of their business. For a solid three minutes, and 13 messages, they probed and probed, not taking no for an answer. Eventually they said \"fine, if I'm no good to you, I'll just leave.\" My response was \"Okay, have a nice night, sleep well, and enjoy your date.\" I then went to bed. Apparently Apple wasn't actually being serious, and me being my Asperger's self, I completely misread that and made them feel rejected.\n\nNow, we'll talk about Melon (don't worry, this will all tie in at the end). Melon was a girl who previously had feelings for me that were not reciprocated, however, I feel I was always nice to her. According to her, I saved her life, and I also listened to her story and gave her a lot of support, and told her I would always be there to help her. She said the same about me, talking about how much she would always care about me. She proceeds to forcibly demand I tell her my past and my story, and says she won't judge me. A few days later, I have a Multiple Personality Disorder episode where one of the people inside of my head comes to the outside, and says some very eery (but again, not inherently bad) poetry type stuff. Later I apologise for the episode and say it won't happen again. She makes a post on her story which my anxiety tells me is about me, so I ask if it's me she's talking about. She gives a reply something like \"My life doesn't revolve around you,\" and my response is a sarcastic jab, \"It's called anxiety, and it eats you from the inside out, not that you'd know anything about mental illness, would you?\" This is weeks after I help her figure out she's bipolar. Admittedly, it was very insensitive for me to say, but these people became friends with me knowing I was sarcastic and bitter. I literally warned them.\n\nPretty much, she flips out because of this, and proceeds to call me insane and unstable for having Dissociative Identity Disorder, calls me \"pity-seeking\" (keep in mind she dragged my story out of me) and insults me in other ways too. She gets Apple and both decide that they don't wanna be my friends anymore. They tell me I never did anything for them and that I'm a terrible person and never loved them.\n\nHere comes Carrot. Carrot is someone who I was somewhat close to, and friends with both Melon and Apple. In the middle of the night, while these people's stories are lighting up with a hangout I wasn't invited to, she messages me telling me to back off from her friends. I'm like \"are you kidding? lol.\" and she tells me I killed her friend group and tore them down. \n\nEnter Rutabaga, Carrot's best friend. We almost had a relationship, but we decided to wait. Carrot tells me Rutabaga has no respect for me because I hurt her friends. I now have 4 people who are telling me I was never a friend to any of them, including the only person I truly trusted, Apple.\n\nWhen I show Carrot screenshots of chats showing that I was being prodded at and insulted, she denied it and continued to give no reason as to why they all hated me, just that I ruined everyone's mood and brought them all down. This makes me feel really guilty.\n\nTo end the story, they all left me and took another friend with them, Kumquat. When I commented under a post of Rutabaga's saying \"Nice aesthetic, I like it,\" Kumquat replied saying \"thank u, next\" to which Melon replied \"HAHHAA ðŸ˜‚\". in the end of this all, I feel really ridiculed and as though I can't trust anyone anymore, BUT I also feel like maybe it was all justified?\n\nAITA for making my friends feel like I'm cold, even though they knew that's who I was? It hurts, but was I the antagonist all along?\n\nThanks for the advice,\nBanana",

Back in October, the two of us (person I want to ask) were good friends, nothing to think too hard about. One of my close friends told me I should \"focus on her,\" since we're both encouraging friends. And so things stared going smoothly for the first few months. But both her and I became busy with school, and as college applications + side projects subtly piled up, we gradually kinda stopped talking to each other. Not entirely, but we used to talk everyday not that long ago... I'll just say there is definitely some awkward wall between us, not sure how else to explain this\n\nI know I've been irresponsible as a friend and all that stuff, so I've been trying my best to patch things up with her in February/March. My initial problem was that I wasn't sure if she would want to go with me, since things had gone kinda out of hand.\n\nBut the real problem happened this week on a hiking trip with friends. The same close friend casually asked me if I wanted to go to prom. Now, literally back in early February, the two of us were talking about potential prom dates at a birthday party. We had both told each other who we wanted to ask, and at the time they were obviously different people. Let's call my \"date\" person A and my close friend's date person B. \n\nDuring our hiking hangout(about two months after the birthday party), my close friend tells me person B has a boyfriend, and that he wanted to ask person A. I couldn't get myself to say anything to his face right then and there, but I have texted him over this. He gave a couple of inconsiderate excuses, and now, despite asking again to have a calm discussion over this, he's been ghosting me :/\n\nNow a third friend told me that my close friend had told him that \"oh, I think OP and person A havent talked in forever.\" This is true to some extent, and I feel godawful about it because it is lowkey true. although I can't do much over being busy and stressed over college.\n\nMy close friend has told me that he assumed I moved on from person A, which I just find really frustrating. I would have told him if \"things weren't going well,\" since we were friends and all, but I guess not. I'm not really sure what to do, it seems like he is going to ask her without really confronting me about it first (kind of a scumbag move, but rn whats more important is the end result)\n\nFirst of all, AITA?\n\nSecond, would it be reasonable to ask my close friend to all go together as a group of friends, but neither of ask person A?

I have received some good morning texts from her, and she'll usually text me back when I message her, so I feel like I'm overreacting. But, I hung out with her two days ago and she was really tired from work, so I told her I would leave so she could get some rest. After that, I decided I would wait for her to text me, because I have texted her first for the past week or two. She hasn't messaged me and it just feels like she isn't as enthused as she was at first?  I feel like an asshole just having these feelings and I think it's because she is having problems coping with her last relationship, but I'm just rattled about it and I don't know if giving up is a fair option. \n\nI just can't tell if she really likes me or if she's using me to fill a personal void from her past relationship. Please give it to me straight Reddit, and feel free to AMA. ",

She lives in a small city with a lot of stray cats and used to leave food outside for them, she knew their personalities and would name a few of them.  As I was leaving her place one night one of the cats approached me.  She got super excited because that one had always been super timid and stayed away from everyone.  But it started rubbing up against me, letting me pet her, letting me hold her, etc.  The ex basically talked me into taking the thing home with me, which I did because the cat had some kind of connection with me.\n\nThat week I brought her to the vet, got her shots, got her spayed, and got medicine for fleas and worms.  She was also very thin when I got her, so I made sure she had good food and occasionally wet food.  It's been over two years now and I am just completely apathetic to this animal.  Look I have been a good pet owner.  She goes to the vet regularly, I buy her toys and play with her, I even bought her a 6' tall cat perch thing that she likes a lot.  Her litterbox is always clean, she always has good food (never bought the super cheap stuff), and I make sure to spend time giving her attention.  But I just have no emotional connection to this animal.\n\nI've always been an animal lover too, people that abuse animals make me fucking sick and I still can't watch My Dog Skip.  But I'm also just tired of being tied to this animal.  I'm tired of sweeping cat litter, and getting rid of the odors, of cat hair and things getting knocked off tables.  I'm really just tired of taking care of an animal I feel nothing towards.  I honestly think if I had an animal that I actually loved, I wouldn't have a problem doing any of this.\n\nThere's also a part of me that thinks she would probably be better someplace where the owner actually loves her.  But I'm also pretty sure the cat has already bonded with me pretty closely, and she's still very timid around anyone else.  So I'm not sure if giving her up wouldn't even be best for the cat at this point.  I was going to give her up within a few months of getting her, but felt super guilty about it and decided not to.

Understandably, it's difficult trying to coordinate the schedules of a bunch of busy people, but I feel like I've reached my wit's end with the bi-weekly string of text messages and emails with new proposed dates because someone can't make it, or a restaurant is booked, or whatever.  It's gotten to the point that she's throwing around dates in March and April, and this coordination has been going on since October.\n\nI really just want to be able to say \"No, I'm not interested in having dinner with you at an expensive restaurant an hour from my home on a date certain two months from now.\"  But I can't because we send each other business somewhat regularly, and we've done work for each other's businesses too.\n\nI'm getting pretty annoyed by now because (1) I have no idea what I'm going to be doing in two months.  There are millions of things that could come up that would take priority over a friendly/professional/networking dinner.  (2)  She keeps suggesting high end restaurants that I really have no interest in going to.  Sure, we can all afford it, but I really have no interest in paying $150+ for me and my wife to put on a tie and drive an hour to sit uncomfortably at a white table cloth dinner with a waiter that comes around with a crumb scraper.  (3)  I have no idea if I'm going to be paying for myself, if the bill is going to be split between all of us, or if her business is paying for it.  I definitely don't want to sign up for splitting a massive bill with some of the other boozy invitees.  (4)  I would be much more inclined to attend if she said \"I'm having a BBQ at my house on this date, a bunch of people are invited, come if you can make it!\"  I just don't feel right making a commitment two months out, and I don't want to feel like I'm obligated to go to this thing if she keeps moving around the schedule to make sure I'm free on that date.  (5)  If she wants to be friends, let's be friends and do friend stuff.  If she wants to do professional networking, set up something professional.  But I can't stand this constant blurred line between the professional and personal relationship that she's trying to ride.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to commit to a dinner with someone who sends me business?

It was a Friday evening and the LARP was scheduled for the next evening, and the dress code was pretty simple (pants &amp; long sleeve shirt, no collar).

The LARP only had about 20 people in it, and it wasnâ€™t any official event or anything, just something to do for fun.\n\nMy partner drove me to the thrift store to help choose a shirt, which again, could have been almost anything, and was totally optional. We didnâ€™t check the hours beforehand, and when we got there, we noticed that the store closed at 6. It was 5:46. \n\nAs a rule, I try not to enter a store less than 30 minutes before closing. I know retail workers are generally expected to have the store closed and cleaned by closing time, and I donâ€™t want to be a dick to retail employees who need to close the cash register. Whenever Iâ€™m with someone who wants to enter a store that close to closing, I am super apologetic and try to make sure we leave as soon as possible.

I thought my SO could handle finding a shirt alone, and figured I was around for consulting if necessary but didnâ€™t need to help look. Meanwhile, the cashier was getting more and more annoyed. A couple more people walked in, and she informed them that the store was closing soon.\n\nSO keeps asking my opinion on every shirt and then rejecting every single one. I say to just pick one so we can leave. SO tries on a couple, canâ€™t decide, and keeps putting them on the rejected clothing rack. I see something I want and decide to buy it, go up to the cashier and pay for my item, apologizing for being there so close to closing. Cashier, visibly annoyed, says nothing. \n\nMy SO comes out of the dressing room a but later, pays and reminds me to pay for my item. I say I already paid for it, like 10 minutes ago.

We leave the store and my SO points out that we werenâ€™t even the last ones to enter or leave the store.

            "input": "As far back as I can remember, my dad wasn't content if he didn't inflict pain on most things that were small, defenseless and weak. Specifically, my siblings and I. This is basically your typical abusive household where I couldn't even so much as bat an eye and before I knew it, I was a recipient to a backhand square to the face. I firmly believe that my father derived some sort of pleasure or satisfaction by making us and my mother feel inferior and truly undeserving of anything else good in this world. I wasn't exactly deprived but what I did have, was mostly provided by mother that made a living off of scamming people. As far as what she did to sustain us, that is a story for a different day. As time went on, he never actually improved and it got worse. My mom became a literal punching bag for him. My mom was never defiant and besides trying to stand up for herself from time to time, she was pretty docile, for the most part.  I've gathered from most of my uncles and aunts that being raised by my grandparents on my dads side was hard in every sense of the word. They each can recollect a time when they have been subjected to an indiscriminate amount of hatred. When my father would recall memories from his upbringing I would view this from a very empathetic point of view. My father would remember times during his upbringing where he sustained multiple beatings and punishment that felt truly unwarranted. I would like to make it a known fact that I too, have a child of my own. I have never laid a finger on her and as far as I am concerned, I am a firm believer that you can discipline your kids without the need for violence. I should have probably prefaced with this but I am a second generation Mexican-American and living under an abusive household in my culture, is pretty common.  Common in my eyes but not acceptable. I would be more than happy to reveal more details about how shitty it was to grow up in a home where walking on eggshells seemed less of a punishment than what actually took place where I grew up --DM me. Let's fast forward to 8 years later and I get the news that my father is getting deported to Mexico because he is being accused of sodomy, rape and countless other charges by a woman whom he had married after my mother. I have wondered for a while now if the charges against my father were actually true or if he had pissed off his wife to the point where she felt like the only way out was to press charges and get him arrested seemed like the only viable option. Either way, he is currently back in his native country and barely making ends meet. I feel like I need to address the nightmares where I dream of beating up my father and  it varies from dream to dream. In some dreams I beat him to a pulp with my fists  and in other dreams I am bludgeoning with a huge, blunt object to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. I do not wish to have these dreams but they come about, subconsciously. I have researched dream interpretation sites and all of them, for the most part, insist that hatred and resentment on this level, pretty much affirms what I have been feeling all this time. My father has lived in these states well over 20 years so he doesn't know much else. Since his recent deportation, he has had to assimilate and re-adjust to an environment he has not been a part of for a very long time. Because of this, I am receiving a lot of pressure from both my siblings and my relatives to provide for him in a way that would allow for his sustainability. I do not wish for advice. I have adopted a pretty firm stance that I will not provide any support. I have lingered on this topic for far too long. I have never been close to my father and at this interval, I don't care for it much anymore. Would I be so heartless as to say that I don't care whether he lived or died? I am pretty strategic, along with my partner about where most of finances go and cutting into what we currently have going on, would not allow for an additional expense, especially when dealing with another human being. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To start off, I was 17m, my girlfriend was 18f. We'll call her dirt. So, I had just started up another year of school. And already from the last year, I've had my own circle of friends. Consisting of 3 males, including myself. And 3 females. A balanced group, a few of them; dirt in particular, I've never really paid much attention to, and didn't really care about them as much as the others as they always had their own flaws that annoyed me. Now me, being decently young back then, didn't really ever have a girlfriend before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to my shock, only about 2 months after knowing dirt. The messenger of our group, we'll call her mike, so mike, had just received a little gossip on dirt's recent crush, which just so happened to be me. At the end of the day, mike told me about it. I was mind blown, confused, dumbfounded. Basically a surge of emotions rolling around screaming what the hell is going on?? But I made up my mind. I wanted to try having a girlfriend, and so I did. The first few months went smoothly, she was so kind, and i was kind straight back. And the time we spent was fun. I couldn't have really asked for more. Then, at the end of the school year; my parents decided they'd like to finish my education by homeschooling me. Naturally, being myself. I agreed on a whim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until later when I looked into it more, that I realized I wouldn't be able to see dirt anymore. So our relationship would become long distance from now on.  So we went our separate ways, still together. But not in real life. In the first 3 months, I was hit with a heavy depression by this fact. I wouldn't leave my room for hours and i stopped caring about things. And to make things worse, when I finally recovered. She changed, she was like a different person almost. It was subtle but I could tell. At the time i had no clue and blissfully passed it off, but looking back now the signs were clear and I had the chance to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when it started, no longer theoretically being in moderation by me, she was free to do as she wished. And as such, she could change her priorities. So she started caring less, as dumb as I was, even I saw this coming. But the thing is, there was so much more to it. even now I don't know the half of what she did behind my back. She started being friends with my sister, and she started ERPing as well, (which stands for Erotic Role Playing) Of course at the time I had no clue she did this as I trusted her enough to not have to look on her social medias, otherwise I would have immediately ditched her for cheating.  And after this, started the deception and lies, she would lie to me. I would want to confront her about things she's been doing that don't really sit well in a relationship. But every time, she would pass it off. Then talk to my sister,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not just being jealous here, she genuinely cared about my sister more than I. And I wasn't to happy as you could imagine, as that's not how this works. Multiple times i confronted her, to not avail. But, in the end started to grow knowledgeable. I realized that my issues can't be solved by no means that i've tried. And that I need to end it. She's showed all the unspoken and implied signs of a manipulative psychopath. So how would i go about this? At the time, I was still my too nice for my own good gullible self, I couldn't simply end it by talking to her about it, even on a whim. \n\nSo out of ideas, and approaching the 2 year mark for our realtionship, I decided, if I'm too weak to end it. I'll just get her to end it for me. So, I did the thing that annoyed her the most. Surpassing her, every time she tried to speak something factual, I would correct it, and the thing is, it was super easy, she's not the brightest so almost everything she said would have a bottom line or different answer. Eventually, she had enough and we finally broke up. There's more to this experience, but this is all that's relevant to the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in all in all, I simply want to know Am i the asshole for doing what I did? And did i need to do it that way? Or were there better choices here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 17m, 18f girlfriend started off nice and happy, moved on to be a pyscho, discovered things about her.\n\nDecided to try and end it, not good enough to end it, so i let her do it for me by getting her to a point where she was sick of me.",

I live in the same dormitory as A, B, and C.  At the beginning of the school year, A and B got into a really heated conflict/argument, and it ended up becoming pretty personal, with A getting so mad as to yell at B that she was a \"disgusting person,\" and the 2 have been avoiding each other ever since.  I personally did not see what the conflict was about, and although the 2 kept avoiding each other, I would still regularly hang out with both of them individually and try to avoid talking about it with either group.  Ultimately, C, D, and E all took to the side of B (some of them had witnessed the conflict and some of them had not), and I decided that I could not fairly judge who to take sides with so I decided to remained neutral.\n\nFlash forward to a few days ago, and I have been hanging out with A fairly often, and A really only hangs out with me.  I am still friends with B, C, D, and E, and we still regularly hang out and go out together, but I spend a lot more of my free time with A.  One night, after me and A came back from a party and were both fairly drunk, we ran into B, C, D, and E.  A stayed fairly quiet when we saw them while I started to make conversation with them.  As I was wrapping up the conversation and about to leave, A loudly made several rude remarks to B and walked off.  Later that night I heard B, C, D, and E talking in B's room about how shitty of a person A is.  They kept calling him names and attacking his character, while also mentioning that I have shitty taste in friends and that they don't understand how I keep hanging out with A.  I did feel bad about this, as I know A much better than they do, and although A can come off as a bit arrogant and brash (he was featured on a pretty highly up voted post on r/iamverysmart), A has opened up a lot to me about some shit that he's gone through and I don't think it's fair to just call him a shitty person like they were.\n\nA ends up coming into my room, mad that they are talking shit about him, and proceeds to rant about them to me, attacking the character of not only B, but C, D, and E as well.  A then complains that, in this conflict he has no one on his side, and that I should stand up for him and defend him because we are supposed to be friends.  He acknowledges that I didn't want to take sides in this conflict, as I never join in while they talk shit about him, and as I always try to avoid talking about it- but A argued that I should be more assertive and defensive of his character to my other friends when they start talking about him.  I continued to refuse to take either side, and said that he should respect my wishes to stay out of it, especially since I have to see B and C all the time.  He then accused me of only liking him because he has connections to fraternities around campus and could thus get me into parties.  At this point, I was pretty fed up with him for saying that and I just told him to leave my room if he thinks that little of our friendship.\n\nAfter some reflection, I feel like I definitely could have handled the situation better, and at least made a promise to A to defend his character if I were ever around while they are talking shit about A.  I have reasoned that doing this isn't necessarily me taking a side, as long as I start to defend B's character whenever A talks shit.  Maybe I should start being a better friend in general.\n\nAm I the Asshole for not defending A?",

We broke up after she revealed she was dating someone else behind my back and I got upset over feeling used. \n\nDetails :\n\nRecently, I dated someone who admitted that i was their first tinder date after a long period, eventually admitting she had a broken engagement awhile back that resulted in a psychological trauma.\n\nNow this has happened to me more than once. I guess I have a friendly and approachable look, fit, totally put together life, and very relaxed personality. I'm not an instagram model but I feel like I'm pretty competitive. I can go from matched on tinder to drinks at bar pretty smoothly thanks to confidence in dating and what i hope is a good personality. Usually this \"you're my first date on tinder\" scenario ends up with a quick drink and the realization that neither of us have any chemistry and we split. It has always stuck in my mind though, am I just a placeholder? A warmup act for women to date and bide their time while searching for a top tier tinder date?\n\nSo anyway, from the get-go I stated that I was interested in a serious relationship and pressed several times over the course of several dates that I wanted to learn more about what she wanted. I wanted to know if we were compatible or if I was wasting time. I never got a real reply, just vague answers or \"i'll tell you later\". Another red-flag was related to the fact that we both work in the same field, and she said on a date as a joke \"i was kind of hoping to use you for your network to get a job\", as she is unemployed in the field right now. That worried me but I brushed it off. Anyway, several dates later I got the breakup call, with the news that she's been dating someone else who she was able to open up emotionally with.\n\nI've been through plenty of breakups, and am usually pretty cool about it but this time I had a total emotional breakdown. Just a bunch of sappy texts really. I had been holding a lot of pent up emotion waiting for her to open up emotionally to me but she had been opening up to someone else.\n\nI feel like I was an easy person to date as a placeholder while she searched for another boyfriend. Specifically I feel like I did a lot of work building trust and confidence in her to start dating again, which she used to find someone else. She then dumped all that emotion from our relationship on the next dude line.\n\nProblem :\n\nI feel like I got used.\n\nShe feels I am deluded.\n\nAITA?",

I used to be very vocal about it, posting about how I wished for death's embrace on public platforms and sharing depression memes/posts. These days though, I've been doing better since I started getting professional help and making lifestyle changes (like cutting out depression and suicide jokes from my social media feeds) months ago.\n\nI have friends who also have depression. We've been friends even before I started getting help, and we still talk though not as often as we used to. I try my best to support them during their episodes since they're either unwilling or unable to get help due to lack of time, money, or just the belief that it won't get them anywhere.\n\nSometimes though, it feels weirdly suffocating to talk to them. The dynamic we have just isn't the same and there are times when I feel like my mind's going back to a bad place when suicide gets brought up. I want to help them but the ways that worked for me either don't work for them or they're unwilling/unable to try, so I just don't know what to do and end up feeling helpless as well.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to slowly distance myself from them because of this? I care about them but at the same time I just can't handle the heaviness of depression talk with them anymore, and it feels like we get nowhere when we talk about their problems.

She decided to move in with me after graduation with the goal of also preparing to apply for [rigorous graduate degree program] at some point. It is also important to know that the house we would both be living in was purchased as an investment property by our parents (we're very fortunate for all they're able/willing to do for us). We would also be living with a roommate who was one of my classmates, as well as my cat. Finally, it is important to note that while my sister is not a complete train wreck of a human, she is certainly not known for being the most responsible or tidy. \n\nSo right after my sister graduated, she was living at home with my parents for a few months while she prepared to move down to where I was living. During this time she decided that she wanted to get a pet mini pig after meeting a friend's and falling in love. I immediately gave my parents numerous reasons why that was a bad idea:\n1. pigs are notorious for being too smart for their own good, i.e. you might have to end up baby proofing your house if you have one\n2. no one had any reason to think that my sister was responsible enough to handle a pet pig, and since she planned on moving in with me, the pig would then become my responsibility, which I didn't find fair, especially considering what was going on in my life at the time\n3. even though I'm her sister and my parents were our landlords, we also had a paying tenant, who nobody thought to get permission from. In my experience during college, pets were only allowed if all of the roommates consented, and I thought that was still important in this instance. \n4. We didn't know how a pig would potentially get along with my cat, who I had had for over 3 years at that point \n5. My sister was in an inherently transitional point in her life at the time, and was not able to predict where she would likely be in 1, 3, or 5 years, and therefore it seemed irresponsible to get a pet that would likely be very difficult to bring along with her while she figured out her life. \n\nDespite all of these points, my parents insisted that my sister be allowed to \"make her own mistakes\". I pointed out that this was ridiculous, because my sister had no money and my parents were planning on bankrolling this \"mistake\", but that too fell on deaf ears. So, ultimately my sister gets what she wants, a little baby mini pig.\n\nI have to say, the pig was actually adorable and sweet. She got along with my parent's cats and dog well, and was really not too much trouble like I had predicted. HOWEVER it was still not sustainable for a few reasons:\n1. pigs can be litter box trained, but you cannot use kitty litter, because they are pigs, and therefore will eat it, and which point it will clump up in their stomach and they could die. Therefore they had to use sawdust, which does fuck all to mask the potent odor of pig waste, and needs to be completely changed out daily. \n2. the pig absolutely refused to walk on asphalt or anything that wasn't smooth. Because of this, her hooves began to grow out of control, and taking her to a vet was not really a viable option due to...\n3. her size. She didn't stay \"mini\" for long. I don't have a final weight, but just know in the short time my family had her, she got pretty freaking big\n\nSo as to the resolution for the story, which I suppose isn't as sad as I might have predicted, my sister ended up moving in with me sans pet pig. This was because, as I said from the beginning, the pig was too much work and responsibility for her. This meant my parents (AKA my mom) were now responsible for her. However, due to the overgrown hoof issue, which to my mom's credit, she did try to work on to no avail, they ultimately had to surrender the pig to a farm, which conveniently backs up to their backyard. However she did not stay there permanently, and was eventually moved to some other farm in the area. According to my mom, we would be welcome to visit her whenever we like, but no one has. I don't know what the future holds for this pig though. Will she die of old age on a farm? I find that unlikely, but who knows. \n\nAs for anyone who might be wondering why my parents ever even entertained this idea, I'm still pretty confused about it too, but I think part of it is that my parents have always considered my little sister very sensitive, which is not untrue, however because of this, they tend to treat her with kid gloves. I personally think this has only made the problem worse and kind of stunted her maturity. I would like to note however that I love my sister very much and despite our differences I have considered her my best friend throughout all of this. \n\nAnyways, thanks to anyone who read all of this!

The core of my problem is at the end, if you want to skip there. \n\nâ€‹\n\nI'm in this online community where we talk over discord. I've met some of my best friends there, including my best friend who I've known for almost 4 years now, and although we do have some drama, it's worth it because I really truly love these people.\n\nâ€‹\n\nThe most recent drama happened when I found out the aforementioned friend had made a private group chat with some of my other close friends. Of course I was hurt - why wouldn't they want me there? The real problem though, was that I had to kind of push him to tell me, because I suspected it and if I didn't know for sure, my mind would have gone to a very dark place and assumed the worst. See, I have anxiety, which means that I have a tendency to get very paranoid and assume the worst of a situation is true, especially in situations like this, where I think there might be people doing things without me, especially very close friends like this. But, to make things worse, I later found out that he hadn't told me the full truth about this group chat. I won't say specifically, but the important part is that he left out some crucial details about what they were doing in the chat. I found this out from a different friend who was also in the group.\n\nâ€‹\n\nThis really hurt me. I thought I could trust my friend. I would have trusted him with anything. I understand why he held back, cause he knew it would hurt me, but being lied to hurts so much worse. I hate being left in the dark. When there's important information about me that I don't know, I tend to panic and overreact, because of my anxiety, and the only real thing that helps is getting some solid, concrete facts. So now that I know he doesn't want to tell me the whole truth in certain situations, I find it harder to trust him.\n\nâ€‹\n\nSo here's the real conflict: I now trust him less, and I know he's inclined to do things behind my back, without me. However, he feels like me asking about these things is an invasion of his privacy. Of course I believe he has a right to privacy, and I also know he has a right to do whatever with whoever he wants, however much it may hurt me. I feel conflicted though. As I mentioned, when I'm in the dark I panic, so I go to him and ask him if he's doing things without me, which he feels is an invasion of his privacy. But I don't know what else to do. Not knowing is so much more painful. I don't know how to respect his privacy but also be aware of what's going on. \n\nâ€‹\n\nI've never felt so conflicted. I feel like a real asshole for invading his privacy and for not feeling like I can trust him as much now. I feel like maybe I'm a bad friend for not trying to understand his side enough or something... I'm having trouble making sense out of this situation entirely.",

I wasn't given a response until October. The paperwork and HR processing took a while, so I only just started working officially a couple of weeks ago. Now, this job I have taken has almost no room for growth and is not the career that I see myself committing to (I had to take it due to circumstances that would preclude me from other job options should I not take this job and get licensed). I aspire to seek a career in research and academia. In an effort to pursue my goals, I applied to PhD programs in December. I did not disclose this to my employers for several reasons: I had still not begun working, there were several problems with HR that threatened my recruitment, so there was a chance I wasn't going to work there anyways, and I did not know the HR processing would take so long, so I thought that if I were to be hired, I would have been able to work for a while before having to leave. The ultimate reason why I did not feel the need to tell them was that never in my wildest dreams did I think I would get accepted. I was applying to a competitive program, in a great school, in a highly sought out location. I honestly did not think I would get in. I was sure I would be rejected, which would give me another year to work with this company. (FYI the reason for thinking I wouldn't get in was not that I was a poor candidate, but rather that I have tendencies for severe underestimation, belittlement, and self deprecation. This is something I am trying hard to improve in myself). But guess what? I GOT IN!!!!! I recently received word that the program was impressed with me and they offered me admission. While I am overjoyed with having the opportunity to achieve my goals, the matter with the job that I just joined is weighing me down. I feel guilty that I will be leaving right after joining them. I hate to give people a bad impression of myself, and I worry that they will think I accepted their offer knowing I would leave so soon just so I can save money until I need to go. The hiring process takes forever, and I feel bad knowing that they'll have to undergo it again so soon right after hiring me. They are extremely understaffed and everyone on the team constantly tells me what a relief my joining was, as it is going to lighten the load a little. I have to tell them soon that I will be leaving them in a couple of months, and I have no idea how I will approach the issue and what I should say. In this country's work culture, people usually hold onto their jobs tightly. It is practically unheard of for someone to quit so soon after being hired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for taking the job, knowing that there was a chance, no matter how small I thought it was, that I would need to quit right after starting? Regardless of your judgment of me, can you advise me on what I should say when I need to quit?",

Sure thing Iâ€™d love a house with a yard for my pup. \n\n     So we start looking and itâ€™s become apparent she wants to split rent three ways, but weâ€™re looking at two bedroom two bath houses, maybe three bedroom depending on the amount of extra space we decide we need (but no one would be living in the third bedroom itâ€™d be like an entertainment room with space for activities we all enjoy like yoga for roommate b, my boyfriends playstation, and maybe a painting station in that extra room for me). Anyways she wants to split rent three ways, so the lowest price for a two bdrm in my area is 1000 not including utilities. Instead of paying 500 each (500 from me and my bf and 500 from her before utilities) she wants me and my boyfriend to pay 667.00 a month for the same space she pays 333.00 for before utilities. \n\n      Now donâ€™t get me wrong, I agree me and my boyfriend should pay more if we get the master, and Iâ€™m willing to pay 50-75 dollars more because we have the master and the bigger bathroom (however if that wasnâ€™t enough for her Iâ€™d be fine with her having he master and my boyfriend and I could have the second bedroom). I just donâ€™t feel like we should pay double her rent for that master. I also would of course want to split utilities where me and my boyfriend handle 2/3 and she handles 1/3 of the bill. And weâ€™d even be willing to pay for the Netflix and Hulu subscriptions for the house because we do that already. \n\n       I explained this to her when we were looking at houses and she says she sees where Iâ€™m coming from but because itâ€™s easier for me and my boyfriend to raise rent money it should be split 2/3 and 1/3. I understand there are two of us and maybe Iâ€™m just being stubborn but I really donâ€™t think that warrants paying double her rent. My bf and I both work in the service industry and we bust our asses for the money we make.

The depression I thought I beat has returned with a vengeance, along with anxiety and constant, constant suicidal tendencies. I don't really feel safe in my own mind and body. I know I need help, and I'm looking for it incessantly.\n\nNow, my boyfriend. He is one gem of a person. Has stood with me through ALL OF IT. Every single panic attack, suicide attempt, everything. He keeps reassuring me that I make him happy, and he is not affected by all of this. But I can't believe him. I feel like a burden, a liability, a very unstable person who is making this relationship toxic. I feel like I'm burdening a beautiful, positive, near-perfect guy with undue stress. Yes, a good relationship should see through good and bad times, but I feel like I've become incapable of doing normal, human things, and I don't want to be around him and infect his surroundings with my mental issues.\n\nSo, I ask him to leave me.

He says we can face anything together, and that I am not a burden. \n\nI used to think I'm doing this for his own good, but now I just feel shitty for playing with his feelings and going back and forth, though he says I'm not.

I genuinely want everyone at the gym to have a fair and welcome time, and to follow whatever the social norms there are.\n\nHowever, today I am across a situation I'm unsure about. For context, I workout in an apartment building gym that has a decent selection of lifting equipment (rack, barbell, short barbell, curl bar, etc), but just one of each thing. Everyone using the facility generally shuffles around as needed, waiting for equipment or working in. It's particularly hard to handle benching and squatting simultaneously, as we have just the one rack we can use.\n\nToday I came across someone who had each barbell and the rack loaded, along with a handful of other things. Only this person and myself were in the room. I was immediately annoyed and asked this guy if he was using \"all of these\", and he said \"yeah.\" I asked how many sets he had left on the rack, and he said \"idk, about 30 minutes.\" He was clearly using each piece of equipment in a cycle, such that he'd do one set with one bar, take a rest, then do another set on another, take a rest, and ultimately use the rack maybe once every 10 minutes. Since the rack was set up at a bench height and I was planning on squatting, I asked the guy if he could focus on his benching sets so that I could use it sooner to squat (to avoid having to fully unload, rerack, repeat if we worked in). He immediately went on the defensive, saying \"you just got here and now you're telling me how to work out?! Wait your turn or work in\" I said \"you can't just use all the equipment like that, nobody does this\". Eventually after some arguing, he tells me to use the rack anyway, but put everything back \"exactly as it was\" whenever he came by. This sucks, but I had limited time so I went along with it.\n\nBetween sets he could talk to me about how people are reasonable and will let you work in if you don't show up with an aggressive stance like I did. I try to explain that my issue was that he's using every piece of lifting gear, and making everyone work in with him instead of focusing on his sets. He reiterates that I have no right to tell him how to work out. I eventually finish my sets and leave, though at this point we've both calmed down and exchanged names, for gentlemen's sake.\n\nMy feeling going into this was that forcing everyone to work in with you in a small gym instead of doing exercises one at a time was selfish, and I've never seen this before. Otoh, the dude has a point that I barged in and interrupted his workout and asked him to do it differently so that I could do sets without having to adjust the rack constantly or wait half an hour for him to finish. I'm not sure what the right gym culture is here.\n\ntl;dr: Guy at gym uses every piece of equipment on a cycle, I ask him to focus on his rack sets, he tells me to stop telling him how to workout.

In 7th and 8th grade we were best friends, attached at the hip. \n\nFreshman year we went to different high schools l, she developed anorexia and I developed depression. We didnâ€™t talk for maybe two years because of wrongs we had both done. We started talking a little more frequently (and occasionally seeing each other) the last two years of high school. \n\nBetween our senior year and freshman year of college, I noticed she was really active politically with a side I do not agree with. I mean sure, sheâ€™s worn political attire before but it started to bother me. When Kavanaugh was elected to his position, she posted a picture of her TV screen (that showed him) with a caption that was literally just: â€œðŸ‘?ðŸ?»ðŸ‘?ðŸ?»ðŸ‘?ðŸ?»â€?. As a survivor of sexual assault, that really hurt. \n\nI hadnâ€™t talked to her at all the first semester of college. But two weeks ago, she made a social media post: her friend had died. I met this friend (Yolanda) once and followed her on Instagram. She was newly engaged and Beatrice and Yolanda met at an impatient anorexia recovery place. She was obviously crushed. I text Beatrice and ask if she wanted company, because of course I would want to be there for someone despite our differences. She declined but I brought over a pint of her favorite ice cream anyway and left.\n\nA few days ago she invited me to her house, which was supposed to be today. I was supposed to go over at 6pm. Well I got hit with a bunch of responsibilities/feelings really quickly: I have an awful family situation going on with an abusive mother, in danger of losing my health insurance, my new glasses arenâ€™t the correct prescription, etc. I got home and it was too overwhelming for me. So, crying into my pillow I decided to cancel. Here is the conversation:\n\nMe: â€œIâ€™m really overwhelmed tonight can I come over another time? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­â€?\n\nBeatrice: â€œugh ok- i wish i wouldâ€™ve known earlier cause my friend wanted me to spend the night in *a town thats 45 minutes away* tonightâ€?\n\nHer response sounded extremely apathetic to me.

Whereas I still struggle to support myself, getting out from under student loans and monthly expenses, even though I've been progressively making more at my job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she still wants me to pay for everything, single-handedly, in our relationship. 100% rent, 100% food, 100% for the cat's stuff, 100% travel expenses, 100% everything else. Meanwhile, she will just continue to save her money 'for a rainy day' or to buy a house under her name only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems really one sided, and I've gone for some things- like paying full rent and food. But I refuse to budge on other things. AITA since I'm living in her culture (though eventually we plan to move to the U.S.), or is this taking advantage of me?",

The room is supposed to be a shared room between two people, but my roommate moved out last semester so I have the entire space to myself.\n\nBecause I'm fortunate enough to have a room to myself, my friend--we'll call her G--and I often hang out in my space after class; we have a lot of the same classes so it's nice to be able to study together whenever we want without bothering other people. I fully enjoy having G in my room and consider her an awesome and respectable friend, but lately she's been getting on my case about cleaning my space and it's beginning to get annoying.\n\nI'll be the first to admit I'm a slob; my room is by no means clean, and ever since I've had the room to myself I've taken a few liberties with the space. There's a pretty fair amount of stuff on the floor, and I recently did laundry so my clothes are sitting out in the open on the spare bed (this includes some of my underwear, but it's all folded neatly into little rolls so you can't really tell what they are). I also have dirty dishes lying around everywhere, and both my desk and the spare desk are fairly cluttered with stuff that I've left and not bothered to pick up. To be completely frank, it's gotten to the point where most open surfaces have begun to lose their functionality simply because of the sheer amount of stuff lying about on them that I'm too lazy to move.\n\nMy room is very messy, but it's not unlivable for me. I'm not even against cleaning it, but I absolutely hate that G is the one telling me to do it. She's not my mother, so I really don't feel like she has the right to tell me what to do, and anyway it's my room. If she's uncomfortable with the clutter then she doesn't have to come over--even though i honestly think my room is the best location for our study sessions because of its convenience, I would be perfectly content to meet up in her room or in the common areas of the dorm if my room is too messy for her to handle. I actually plan to clean it soon, but I want to do it on my own time and by my own volition, not because someone else told me to do so.\n\nEven so, G is in my room a lot, and I know it's probably extremely uncomfortable for her to sit around in my filth (although I do try to keep her favorite spot, a little sitting area under my bed, reasonably clean). The more she nags me, though, the less I want to do anything about the clutter. Would I be an asshole to tell her to keep out of my business, even though she's partially affected? I can tell that she's also as frustrated as I am about the situation, but I don't think I'm in the wrong to want autonomy in my own space that she's under no obligation to share with me.\n\nSo, AITA?",

I wasn't raised with my sister, we grew up in separate foster homes so we aren't super close. I was surprised she invited me to live with her especially after I raised concerns about me living with kids. I'm diagnosed as bipolar II and I was worried about my mental stability around children. She said her kids are usually busy she has a large house and no one would bother me and she really wanted me to come.  This was slightly before Xmas and she invited our mom to stay with her for the holidays. I haven't talked  to our mother in over 5 years because her new husband used to secretly film me in the bathroom when I was a child. I told my mother about this before I left for college and showed her the grocery bag full of DVDs he made and she wasn't surprised because she knew had a sex addiction (I had no clue about). I stopped talking to her because she wanted me to thank this man for money they were sending me during college I refused and told them don't send me shit anymore. I dropped out of school beginning of sophomore year shortly after being diagnosed as bipolar and have been supporting myself ever since. \n\nI had no issue with our mom coming by for the holidays but I did not want to be there. My sister said our mom would only be there a day or so and I could hide in my room but I decided to go visit my boyfriend until the new year. I could tell this upset my sister but I got every one small gifts for the holidays so they knew I was thinking of them but I needed to take care of me. I return and everyone including the kids are being super cold to me. I would be starting CNA school soon so I just hid away in my room. I came back on Tuesday and school started the following Monday.  My classes are 6:30am - 3pm with a minimum 2hr bus ride sometimes 4hours for off site clinical hours so I'm away most of the day and I study at night. I start to sense the house being annoyed that I'm not spending time with them but honestly I'm busy and exhausted and have poor social skills. So I withdraw more and they start to slam doors and play music loud to make their presence known and I get anxious and stay in my room. I stop eating I stop going out to the kitchen. I stop drinking water so I don't have to leave to pee. They get louder outside the door so I just put in head phones and try to tune out hidden meanings in songs they play and words they say.  Also my sister confessed to me that her husband was nasty to her while she was pregnant with his child which makes me not trusting of him at all. And I'm still studying and waking up early. I truly am busy but I don't know what to say to anyone and I feel like my movements are being tracked so I stay even more silent and secluded. I'm super nice and say hello when I do see anyone in the halls or kitchen but my sister sees this as me being fake. I have 3 more weeks of the class and everyone's behavior is becoming more aggressive and dismissive and I feel like the asshole but AITAH for feeling more at peace on my own locked my room?",

I also have autism, which makes it harder for me to know what to do in social situations; it also means that I don't have very good spacial awareness and sometimes get caught in my own world, not very aware of anything going on outside of whatever I'm doing (in this case, reading). Having chosen to live with my mother and not my stepmom when I turned 18 (about 10 days ago), I've been doing much better with my anxiety, because my stepmom isn't around anymore. But this situation just set it off again.\n\nSo this morning I was taking the subway to my percussion ensemble rehearsal. I was sitting next to one of the doors and had put my backpack in front of me. There was another man across from me with a big cart in the aisle. A woman with a walker was sitting a few seats down from him.\n\nAbout fifteen or twenty minutes into the ride, I'm engrossed in my Stephen King book, and the woman gets up to get off. Her walker hits my backpack (I believe that was what happened), and some of her things fall off of it. I move back, trying to give her room but also thinking she has the situation under control.\n\nThen as she's getting off I hear her say something about how I'm a rude boy--- \"or girl, I can't even tell what you are---\" (I'm a trans girl but I look like a boy), \"you see a handicapped woman and you can't even move out of the way or help her.\"\n\nI look up, startled, and immediately try to make room for her, be courteous, but she picks up her things and goes on muttering to herself about me even after she's off the train. She never makes eye contact with me this whole time, by the way.\n\n I move my seat and begin hyperventilating/possibly having a panic attack, idk perhaps I was overreacting but one of my biggest anxiety triggers is messing up in public, especially with people I don't know. \n\nI just ... I don't know. There wasn't much room with the other guy's cart right there, and it did happen right in front of me, but sometimes I just ... there are situations where I don't think quickly enough. It also didn't seem as if I could have helped her pick the stuff up, with the angle we were at --- I think the walker was blocking it, I don't fricking remember the details. It was just something that made me really upset. I think it may have been my first actual panic attack; my anxiety isn't as bad lately, but this just set it off. Like, obviously she was handicapped and I should have been more considerate of that, but I wasn't blatantly ignoring it. Heck, I've spent time in a wheelchair myself. I've used walkers. *I know how it is.*\n\nI wish I could just apologize to her. But she's gone and she obviously thinks I'm a horrible person.",

I wanted to defer, but my father vehemently denied me that right. \n\nFor even more context that led up to what my father said. Over the past three and a half years, I got put into a boarding school I didnâ€™t really like, but put up with regardless. Iâ€™ve never really had a healthy relationship with my father, as Iâ€™m always terrified of his volatile temper, and he was almost never willing to spend time with me as a child. However, he did work to provide me and my family with a comfortable life. At that boarding school, I was overwhelmed with the workload I had to face since I never had to study to get top grades (I only went to international schools before), and asking teachers and friends for help has always been extremely uncomfortable for me. This in turn led to my studies not being great, and me getting a very average ATAR of 61.70. However, I was still able to get into the course I wanted.\n\n\nNow, I havenâ€™t been the best child, but I was never the worst. I had never gotten detention, had never handed in a late assignment, and had never gotten into trouble with teachers. The worst thing I had done at school was not ask teachers for help and not put in as much effort as I should have. The worst thing I did to my parents was steal some money from their credit card, which is awful as is - however, I donâ€™t think it warranted my father telling me to kill myself. He constantly tells me that I wasted three and a half years of my life, that he wasted money on getting me tuition, and that I put him and my mother under stress that no other parent has to face. He also claims Iâ€™m the reason theyâ€™re so close to divorce. He also sometimes calls me an useless moron and that Iâ€™m the most lazy and awful person heâ€™s ever known. A few days ago, I fucked up researching housing costs for my university, and he lost it. He proceeded to yell all of the above at me, and then said, without paraphrasing, â€œA few months ago you told the bloody counsellors that you wanted to kill yourself? Well maybe you should have killed yourself then, it would have been easier on all of us.â€? I started crying really badly and he yelled at me asking why the fuck I was crying and I said through tears that he told me to\nKill myself, and he said â€œYouâ€™re goddamn right, you donâ€™t deserve to live anymore, go hang yourself tomorrow.â€? The next day my mom told me I should feel guilty because I hurt my dad so much and that I should feel bad for making him say those things, and that I should look past it. Again, the extent to which I â€œhurtâ€? my parents was listed above. A few days later I got my acceptance letter, and two days later I told my parents I wanted to defer. My dad lost it again, asking me who the fuck I am to have the arrogance to defer, and that I should be taking this god-given gift and studying hard, rather than fucking deferring, and that I should go fuck myself.\n\n\nSorry if this is a rambling mess, Iâ€™m on mobile and donâ€™t really know how to format. I believe Iâ€™ve covered everything on both sides, so please let me know if clarification is needed. I really want to run away from my parents and start over, but because Iâ€™m 17 my father is still controlling me and forcing me to start university immediately. I feel bad because I have done some things that are wrong, but I donâ€™t feel theyâ€™ve warranted whatâ€™s been said to me. In short - am I the asshole here?\n\n",

            "input": " So I've been with my gffor 4 months now. Things went pretty well at the start but we don't see each other much since we live on opposite side of the city. Problems only started happening recently and mostly only because I have been thinking about breaking up. We never really had too much in common: we're both studying similar majors in uni (that's how I met her); we're from different backgrounds and cultures; and smaller insignificant things like she doesn't eat fruit at all and I love fruit, she doesn't exercise and I like to keep fit, she a chocolate connoisseur and I'm not a sweet tooth, different music and film tastes, etc. But we agreed that didn't matter too much since it didn't really affect how we felt towards each other.\n\nTo give some context, she used to be very into me and wanted to spent time together. Now it seems that only I'm initiating to make plans, meet up and talk, which we don't really do more than once a week. I understand a lot of this strain comes from uni now that the semester's commenced but I sort of feel forgotten and pretty dissatisfied in general that she's not really putting too much effort into the relationship. This feeling isn't based on any empirical evidence; she always tells me that she likes me and has always talked us out of it; but it is based on her attraction to me relative to the past.\n\nWe both agreed before uni began that we would see each other Friday evenings after class and occasionally have dinner out. First week was great spending time together, didn't have dinner. Second week was rough; I felt she was a little cold to me for some reason and I ended up trying to break things off again. She talked me out of it, I ended up reconsidering, opening up to her about how I felt and explained that she needed to improve her communication (not the first time she's told me and not the first time I've told her). We went out for dinner after. Now this is the third week. Last night (Thursday), she invited me to sleep over at her place (parents present) on Friday night. I said I was feeling under the weather and was probably better if I didn't. Come Friday I'm excited to finally spend some time with my gf after a busy week and she tells me that she's spending the evening with her sister. No notice, no apology for surprising me with her sudden plans (she did apologise for \"making me feel sad\" but that's not the point). I've been feeling disrespected like this for a while now.\n\nOf course this one event doesn't encapsulate the whole situation but I do feel like there's been this problem for a while now. I know she's feeling stressed in uni and that's probably what's taking the toll on her to justify her behaviour recently. I don't think it's due to any fault in her character but I feel like she doesn't understand me. I've tried to be honest to her about but it always feels like my words are falling on deaf ears. So I guess this is a bit of a cry for help: would I be an asshole if I were to end things like this now?",

He was from a town 3hrs away and so we didn't see each other through the week, only on weekends when he came to stay with me (I was a lowly student, he had a job and could afford the weekly train fare). We talked non-stop, texts, photos and video chats. So it was heartbreaking for me when he suddenly stopped responding for 5 days. He wasn't on fb/insta but I remembered him mentioning twitter competitions. Queue super sleuth mode.  \nMy super desperate self trawled through every account under his name until I found him...he was alive and tweeting since he went AWOL. Trawled through his tweets and I found one mentioning 'his gf' with another user @'d... she had her insta linked to her twitter and so I fell face first into this strangers wonderful shiny documented 3yr relationship with my bf. It was absolutely horrifying, I cried for days.   \n\n\nMy friends talked me out of contacting this girl, I sent him one last, long, explosive message and 'moved on'. It's coming up to 3yrs now and I have the most wonderful loving partner, I am genuinely happy with my life. But I still get this sick feeling when ex's come up in conversation, that I never tried to warn this poor girl. It came up again last night and I caved and looked at her insta this morning (we share the same first name so it's a name I'm not likely to forget) - they're still together, bought a house together, a dog, engaged, celebrating 6yrs together.   \n\n\nWIBTA for telling her? I just need to know if I'm doing the right thing by leaving it when my heart sometimes says I'm not.  The level of sneakiness on his part always made me feel like I was not the first.

This took place over a decade ago and it's baffled me a handful of times since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn middle school, I was on the 7th grade girls volleyball team. I was a frumpy, awkward kid, and not very athletic or coordinated, but I did a sport every season because my parents thought it was good for me and the middle school teams didn't cut. I wasn't really friends with anyone on the team except one other girl. We had a few after school games with other middle schools nearby, and they ended at about dinner time. Most parents didn't go to games, except for those who volunteered to drive the team, so after the game ended we would call our parents to tell them they could pick us up. We probably sat around 15-25 minutes waiting for parents to get there. My mom would always pack me a snack, usually a handful of pretzels or crackers in a sandwich bag, and maybe like an individual serving of jello to eat while waiting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'd all be starving by the end of the game since we were growing teens and all that, so I'd pull out my snacks and eat them. The other girls on the team started saying that it was super rude of me to eat in front of them when they didn't have anything to eat. Like, multiple comments about how rude I was while I was eating my snacks. I didn't think I should have to share the small snack my mom packed me with seven or eight other girls, so I declined to share except with my one friend on the team. Like I said, it wasn't much to share. This happened at every game, so when I think back on it I think that they could've packed a snack at least for the later games, but they never did. When I did other sports in middle school this never came up; maybe because the games were scheduled differently or because sometimes some adults organized team snacks for us?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, was I the asshole? At the time I didn't really think much about it bc I was happy and eating and I thought it was their problem they were hungry for not being prepared. Not sure if it matters but most of the team were white girls who were super good friends with each other, and then me and my friend were both non-white and not really friends with the other girls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We go out to eat at local restaurants a couple of times a month to get away from the repitition of dining hall food. Financially I am much better off than her. I get lots of money from family, I dont spend a lot, and my parents pay for everything when I am home so I have a lot saved. She has more expenses and is going abroad this summer so as a result does not try to spend a lot of money. As a result I almost always pay when we go out to eat. I am fine with this.

To be clear, I do not tip small. Usually around 15%, perhaps smaller if the waiter does something blatantly to hurt service. That is how much my dad tips, thats what I grew up on. My girlfriend's family tips large amounts, around 20% sometimes higher. On Saturday we went to a local restaurant. I tipped around 13%, namely because the waiter was socializing with another table (I could hear their conversation) while we had been waiting for a while to order dessert. She got angry with me because I was not being generous enough.\n\nI feel that because I am paying (which I am happy to do) she has no right to criticize how much I tip. AITA?",

            "input": "AITA here? I feel like I know the answer to this, but knowing what others think helps. TLDR at the end.\n\nI have this friend, John, whom I've been friends with for about 20 years. I talked with a mutual friend of ours, Tom, recently. Tom, who is also a current customer of mine (John brought him to the business) said that John had some sort of break down at his most recent job waiting tables. He kept oversleeping and was missing/coming in late for shifts, so he went on work disability for stress.\n\nTom said that John blames me for this because after all he did for the business, I forced him out as a partner. I didn't get into specifics with Tom, so I just told him it was either end the partnership or close the business down. Shutting down would cause my customers a good amount of harm because there's a chance they'd incur additional expenses with reconfiguring their current equipment. At the very least, it would be a pain in the ass to switch.\n\nI initially started this business with $40k of my own money. John had no money, but he promised to handle weekly system maintenance, and customer support. I would handle sales &amp; marketing and operations, and we would split onboarding new customers. At the right time, I would get my initial $40k back plus a reasonable % return based on profits. Everything else we would split 50/50 since we split the workload 50/50.\n\nJohn brought Tom and one other business as customers. I was going through a horrible divorce (to the point where my ex was filing false police reports in an effort to get full custody), and I wasn't bringing in new customers like I needed to. \n\nJohn floated the company anywhere from $20-$200 for several months to keep checks from bouncing. All told, his floats totaled about $4k. When I got back on track, I paid John back by giving him a bigger percentage of the fees we charged from onboarding new customers until he was square.\n\nWhile he was floating the company money, I noticed that John wasn't handling customer support or system maintenance. He wouldn't log into the system for weeks or months at a time, if at all. If customers contacted us for support, he immediately asked me for help. He would say he didn't know the system as well as I did, so after helping him (and the customer) I gave him the resources I studied to learn the system for him to study. He continued to ask me for help every time a customer called, and admitted he hadn't studied anything when I asked him. \n\nIt was a choice between enabling him and helping the customer or potentially losing business. Admittedly, I got upset with him after one incident in which he blew up my phone while I was meeting with a potential client. When I didn't answer, he called the client's office explaining that there was a support emergency and he needed me. He called right when I was explaining to said potential client how stable and reliable our systems were, and how we had enough personnel to handle any problems they had.\n\nAfter this incident, there were two or three other times where upset customers were calling me directly saying they had sent emails and left voicemail messages several days ago without a response. I would confront John about this, and he said he had responded and left messages, but they never got back to him. He would then immediately contact them with me present and tell the customer he left messages. The customer would then second-guess themselves, and John would end up handling the issue.\n\nAbout a year after I straightened out my personal issues and after he had been paid back, he was still slacking on his share of work. After another of these complaints, I checked the company email logs. The customer had sent an email that was forwarded to John. However, John had never responded. The only thing I couldn't tell was if John had called the customer or used his personal email address. I then checked the system, and maintenance hadn't been done at that point for about 9 months. I took screenshots and copied logs to document everything.\n\nI took him to lunch and brought up the subject, and I said that I felt like I was doing about 98% of the work but only getting paid 50%. It was taking time away from finding new business, and delaying getting my $40k plus return back as we agreed. John acknowledged I was doing the majority of the work and that he had been slacking, but he said that he floated the company when I was having personal problems. He also said (and I quote), \"And how about all of the customers I brought in?\"\n\nI reminded him that the company paid him back while I haven't gotten anything beyond distributions. I also said, \"You mean Customer A and Customer B? One who's your best friend from high school?\" I then proposed two options. 1) we end the partnership now, become competitors, and keep the customers we each brought on. 2) I temporarily take an 80% share, and give back 5% per month to him for every month that he meets work milestones. He could even start the milestone list and be in charge of editing it until we finally agreed on it.\n\nJohn proceeded to comment that both choices were unfair, and countered with me getting 60%. I said to John that since he acknowledged I was doing about 98% of the work, did he honestly think that I should only get 60% of the profits, and would he agree to that if the roles were reversed? He then said he was only agreeing to option 2 out of our friendship. I wrote up an agreement, we both signed it, and he promised to get the milestone list together in a week.\n\nTwo months later, after asking multiple times for the milestone list, and John either saying \"next week\" or not responding, I got a call from our biggest customer. They had called and emailed three days in a row and nobody returned their call. They called because their service was not working consistently, but now it wasn't working at all. I logged into the system and saw the problem. The particular server's script that clears cache files stopped working, and disk space was almost out. Deleted the cache, rebooted the system, customer's working again.\n\nI checked the system logfiles, and John hadn't logged into the system one time since we switched to the 80/20 agreement. I immediately texted him to call me regarding something urgent about our biggest customer. He called me the next day.\n\nI told him what happened with our customer and that I handled it. He expressed relief and said, \"I wish they had called sooner.\" I said, \"speaking of which, I have something to show you.\" I texted him the screenshots of the system logs, email logs, and call logs, and the list of cache files on the server. I explained that this was what the problem was, and luckily, it was a quick fix. John then said that he couldn't see exactly what caused the problem.\n\nI said that he hadn't logged into the system in over two months. I also said that log screenshots showed that the customer had called and emailed, but they got no response. It also showed that the calls forwarded to his phone. I then said that things weren't working out, and we can't be business partners anymore. If he wanted the business he needed to buy me out of my $40k plus 80%, or I could cut a check for his 20% share so he'd be out. Either way, he needed to decide in 7 days, or I would hire an attorney to figure it all out. I said that I hoped we could still be friends, but I would understand if he didn't want that. John gets very upset, says some words that I don't remember, and hangs up on me.\n\nHe texted me the next day saying he was giving up his 20%, and he didn't want any money. He said he valued friendship over the business, unlike me, and that this was all my plan to steal the business from him.\n\nI saved the texts until I sent him an agreement to relinquish his shares and he signed it. Recently, John texted me randomly, saying that he couldn't believe how I could do this to his friend and how he stuck by my side. I said that I felt the same about him: how could a friend promise to do his share of the business but not do any of it? He then responded that I was a dick. I deleted the texts and blocked his number because fuck him.\n\nTLDR: I invest $40k to start a business, close friend invests $0 but promises to do half the work plus allow me to get back my $40k plus return. He floats the company about $4k while I go through personal problems, but stops doing his share of the work even when he gets paid back. I confront him the first time and he agrees to a 20% share, but still doesn't step up to do work. We almost lose our biggest customer, I confront him again and end the partnership. He calls me a dick.",

I'm not here to debate whether eating meat is right or wrong, but to me, eating meat is akin to murder, and I can't keep spending my leisure time with people who are committing acts that make me want to vomit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy therapist ran the idea of cutting these people out of my life, and I'm starting to seriously consider it.  The thought of not being able to see these people anymore makes me sick, but not as sick as watching them participate in the lifestyle choices they make.  I have not made a decision yet, but I'm strongly considering cutting them out, so that I can live with a healthier state of mind.  AITA?",

However, I typically work all day Mon-Thurs, and do light paperwork Friday mornings. I work from home a good amount, too. \n\nI also do vast majority of care-taking for our son, cook all of our meals, most of the cleaning, plus I help my husband with his business, and run my own little side hustles to make extra income.\n\nMy husband is self employed so his income fluctuates as well. He often works long, strange hours but is pursuing a career he loves after years of us barely scraping by to support his dream. This, trash, and occasionally picking up our son from after-school are his core responsibilities. \n\nHe pays all our rent/utilities, a little under $2k per month. That is the extent of his bills. His family pays his phone/car bills for him and also paid off all his student loans a couple years ago. I pay our groceries, supplies for the house, and whatever our son needs. On top of that I have my phone, auto insurance, student loan bills. $800-1200 per month depending on what I can afford. \n\nEvery. Single. Time that we argue, he throws in my face that he pays for my living expenses and says I â€œcontribute nothingâ€?. I am far from lazy and work hard, but no I donâ€™t earn as much as him, and Its fair to say he is a harder worker than me. He really never stops even at night, whereas after the day is over I like to wind down. I am pretty much in the highest paid position for my field/education/experience, and I donâ€™t want to change fields because I am eligible for licensing soon if I stick with it. I also want to note that our rent is really expensive because he insisted we move here, even though I warned him I didnâ€™t think I could afford it while also paying off my student debt and contributing to a savings account, which was important to me. We both really live â€œpaycheck to paycheckâ€? now, though.\n\nHe keeps insisting that Iâ€™m the jerk and I basically should always do whatever he says because he supports me.

I want to keep my current job because I like it and itâ€™s good for my long term career goals, and honestly donâ€™t think I could make more anyway. I try to make up for it in non-monetary ways like doing almost all cooking, cleaning, and child raising. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

            "input": "This happened in the last couple years but I am still bothered by the results.   \n\n\nI have a great relationship with my husband and his immediate family.   My mother in law (Theresa) in particular is a classy and really fantastic person.  She loves me very much and frequently says she is glad her son found me.   \n\n\nMy mother in law has a sister, my husband aunt (we will call her Betty).  Betty and Theresa had a falling out years ago. Betty rather painfully cut out Theresa and my husband from her life.  Betty loved my husband dearly but didn't want a relationship with her sister so she cut them off entirely.  This falling out was related to hard feelings of competition between the sisters and then resentments about their mother's estate. Theresa doesn't have other family so this hurt everyone.  My husband was a child and it hurt that his loved aunt wouldn't see him.   \n\n\nMany years later Betty is getting married to Clara. Clara is a lovely woman and wants to help Betty get back together with her family.   Everyone reconciles and we start going to Betty and Clara's home once a month for a \"family game night\". While things are reconciled, they are still tense. Betty has a pretty volatile personality with some temper issues. Theresa still feels cautious and hurt. My husband wants things to work, but mostly for his mothers sake.  People usually like me because I am a pleasant people-pleasing sort of woman. Clara loves me but Betty treats me from the start as an outsider.  Betty is a staunch conservative who is ex-military.  (Ironic because she is a lesbian right?)  My husband and I are liberal. My husband is much more liberal than I am and has made me more liberal than ever.   While we rarely discuss politics, it comes up in the course of the kind of games we are all playing together.  Each time Betty gets mad about our viewpoints it becomes obvious that she blames those viewpoints on me ... not her darling nephew, my husband.   \n\n\nFast forward to 2 years of family game nights. Things are tense. Betty doesn't like me and it is obvious. I am an approval seeker so I handle this by becoming very quiet and not participating as much. I have social anxiety and this tension made it terrible. I will be honest.  I didn't want to go any longer.  My husband and I had arguments over it. I would say that she didn't like me.  He would say that is just how she is.  I would talk about tone of voice, body language and facial expressions.  He would not see those things. I wanted his mother to have the relationship she craved with her sister and I wanted him to be able to see his aunt.  I felt guilty and yet hated being forced into these monthly interactions.  I went anyway and isolated myself at these events more and more. I didn't ignore anyone but I stopped being my gregarious friendly self and would stay off in a corner alone on my phone.   \n\n\nWe are expected to RSVP for game nights.  Two times over the 2 years ... I RSVP late. This infuriates Betty. My husband doesn't face book.   The first time the late RSVP happens he tells her that it shouldn't be my job to do this anyway.  He would prefer to do this over the phone with her.  She refuses and insists on using face book and states that it should be my job to manage our social engagements because I am the woman.   \n\n\nThe second time I didn't RSVP fast enough she could see that I had seen the invite ( I was too busy to respond when I opened it and then forgot for a week).   When she lost her temper again at me.  She never talked to me if she could help it so she vented this rage to my husband and I heard of the problem second hand. I told my husband that since the schedule had changed I was having a harder time keeping track of the dates.  I apologized and RSVPed and messaged her to tell her I had forgotten. My husband, making an assumption, thought this meant I hadn't seen the RSVP at all and told his aunt that is why I missed it. She lost her mind.  She said to my MIL that I am a terrible person. She felt that I lied to my husband and I was a bad partner.  She could tell that I had seen it because face book told her it was viewed. She knew that I was deliberately ignoring her and then lying to my husband to say I had not seen it! She thought that I was disrespectful to not RSVP and she never liked me.  My mother in law started to defend me.  She told her that I was a trustworthy and really good partner for her son.  She explained that Betty really had not gotten to know me like she had.  She said that a couple missed RSVPs in 2 years was no big deal.   \n\n\nThe fight between them escalated with Theresa defending me.  My husband and I were told and I said that I wouldn't stop them from seeing her but I no longer would go under any circumstances. My MIL said that she wouldn't go either and my husband said the same. I told them both that I didn't intend to stop them from seeing Betty.   Even though they each had issues with her ... Betty was much nicer to them than she ever was to me and I felt that each had a bit of a relationship with her they liked.   They said that if I wasn't going, they weren't and agreed that Betty was unreasonable.   \n\n\nI still feel guilty.   I got what I really wanted ... which was to not go there any more and deal with this unpleasant aunt-in law.   However, I watched a budding reconnection between sisters get destroyed. My MIL still misses her sister though she directs all of her anger at Betty, not me.   I feel terrible for being the point of contention that made this attempt to reconnect fail.  I feel like if I had been able to get along better with Betty, perhaps not reacted by withdrawing ... perhaps I could have made this relationship better.   \n\n\nTLDR: AITA for failing to make this relationship strong enough to work and being the point of break up of the relationship between my MIL and her sister? My aunt-in-law is a difficult person to get along with, but if it had not been for this conflict she would still be interacting with her sister and my husband. ",

He tended to annoy me, but I didn't want to be mean, so I said nothing. I also never thought he was a bad person by any means, so I'd have felt guilty pushing him away.\n\nWhen he asked to reconnect, I remembered the toleration. That I didn't _really_ like him, but kept being friends for his sake. I said no partially because I don't like him a ton but also largely because I think that that was a toxic situation for him to be in, and didn't want to allow it to happen again. He's a good person and deserves to be with friends who like him for who he is.\n\nOf course, it's easy to point out that I could just learn to like him for who he is, solving the issue outright. But I'm not sure if it's fair for anyone to tell me (or me to tell myself) that I _ought_ to like someone--I either do or I don't. As my dad once said, \"it's not your job to be anyone's friend.\" And I'd rather, for both parties' sake, make it clear which way it is--either we can be genuine friends, or not. No toxic in-between that breeds uncertainty and insecurity. I hate being in that situation and would prefer a clear answer, so I will give a clear answer to others.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that I _am not_ reconnecting and accepting him for who he is seems to be some evidence towards the fact that it wouldn't be a good idea to try; that it would crash and burn because I'm not quite an accepting enough person yet. But perhaps this is just me making excuses.\n\nIATA regarding what happened in the past; I should have gone one way or the other. But AITA now?",

Over the last 6 months, he's been getting increasingly distant and I was starting to feel neglected. Not his fault, he had school and work and stuff. So I brought it up to him, and we worked out a compromise: we'd set aside time for each other once a week, even if it was just a simple phone call. \n\nAt first, we kept to it, making sure we spent time together at least once a week, and if we could afford the time then obviously we'd spend more time together. \n\nBut his new semester started, and it wasn't kind to him. He had a full schedule on most weekdays, but that meant one or two weekdays would be free per week. But he doesn't set aside time for me. I understand that he's busy, but once a week is really the least I can go in terms of maintaining a relationship. \n\nSo I bring it up. He calls me unreasonable for asking him to spend time with him at 2am. Alright, but I was trying to point out the larger issue of him not spending time with me, not saying we should spend time now. So I try and tell him, and he ignores me.\n\nHe's ignored me after fights, or if I bring up something he doesn't particularly like, so it's normal. Another \"rule\" we have is that we don't let fights go on for more than 24 hours. Partly because I have pretty severe anxiety and I need to talk things out to make them right, but also because he needs time to process what happened. So we came to a compromise, within 24 hours we would reach out and contact each other.\n\nBut after 36 hours, he hasn't responded. So I sent him a long message telling him that I didn't feel like continuing the relationship with him, because I date for marriage and I can't marry someone who is not willing to spend time with me at least once a week.\n\nIt wasn't just the spending time aspect, I think. It was how we negotiated those rules for him to break them. I was really trying to come to a compromise with those rules, like spending time together once a week and talking after a fight after 24 hours, because I really do need to spend time with someone to maintain a relationship and I really do need to talk after a fight to reassure myself, but he just disregarded those even though I'd talked to him before.\n\nSo, AITA?

(Also she knows I hate slime and can't touch it cause it's freaks me out what is one of the perks of me having Aspergers)\n\nToday she pushed me over the edge when I realized I got my period and it hit hard, blood was running right into my jeans so I rushed to the toilet but L pushed past me so I tried stopping her and said \"L stop I'm on my period and I'm bleeding through\" she looked at me laughed, Locked the bathroom door then said \"but I'm already in\" she proceeded to take as long as she could in the toilet, probably about 10 minutes. By the time she was out blood was all over my white jeans and I was fuming.\nSo I got a pad went and changed my underwear, changed my jeans for leggings. \nMy bloody jeans where Inside out so the blood was alot more visible I took them, went into L's room then did a perfect throw from the door to smack in her face. She looked shocked for a second, looked at me then looked at what hit her then screamed, like those movie scenes screams where wine glasses explode she also started crying and mom came in thinking she fell or something and then shouted at me although I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nDo you think I went a bit far?",

Maybe the bartender made a simple mistake, it happens but I do want that cocktail so I ordered again hoping that this time was right, the waiter takes the orders and the menÃ¹ back and we kept chatting, I said joking to my friends that if there's coke again in my cocktail I'll send it back.\n\nFF to when the bartender was making our cocktails again and here it is, he is pouring coke in my drink, again, so when the waiter comes in I gently ask to change my cocktail since it is not properly done, so the waiter goes speaking to the bartender which replies that he does cocktails like they are written in the menÃ¹ if I wanted my own twist I should've said it earlier.\n\nSince I don't want to make too much of a scene I said that most probably I was wrong and didn't read the menÃ¹ carefully enough (but I was 101% sure I read it carefully) so I said that I'll accept my cocktail like it is, if in the menÃ¹ there's coke and not sprite, so I'll ask for another menÃ¹ since the waiter took ours earlier when he took the orders to double check. And Yes I was right from the beginning the cocktail is made how I said, and on the menÃ¹ in that bar is written like i recalled.\n\nIn the end the waiter apologized and changed my cocktail making a little joke saying this time it will be exactly like I was supposed to receive it  and after that he offered us a round of free shots.\n\nI felt really bad while my friends started poking at me saying the next drink will contain spit and that probably the bartender was fired (which for the record he wasn't) but after that I felt really bad, I'm no Gordon Ramsey shitting on everything unless is perfect and was actually my first time sending something back, so in the end AITA?",

This was an overnight trip and we stayed there for three days. The trip was pretty fun until the last day. I had missed lunch so, I was upset with myself. I was in the lunch hall and I shoved a chair a bit (keep in mind, I suffer from Bipolar Disorder so my temper can flare up at times, but Iâ€™m much better at dealing with it now). I didnâ€™t shove it too hard and I was ready to leave the cafeteria and head off to my next workshop. All of a sudden, this lady with rectangular frame glasses and starts yelling at me. Iâ€™ll name her GF (grey fury).\n\nGF: *storms up to me* Hey! Youâ€™re making an ass out of yourself! Youâ€™re a stupid ass!\n\nSide note: I donâ€™t deal well with being repeatedly followed and confronted because my Bipolar disorder makes me afraid of other people. The best thing for me to do when agitated is to leave and de-escalate things.\n\nMe: This has nothing to do with you. Leave me alone, please!\n\nAt this point, she got even more indignant and followed me around more.\n\nGF: Iâ€™m not the one making an ass out of myself! You are! You look absolutely stupid and ridiculous right now!\n\nI had had it. I was so scared, mad, and anxious. I finally stood up for myself.\n\nME: *Yelling, visibly upset* Leave me the hell alone, bitch! What the actual fuck do you not understand about that?!\n\nGF tries to get closer.\n\nME: GO TO HELL, YOU OLD HAG! LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE!\n\nI ran to the bathroom, shut myself in, and cried until my teacher found me. I came out of the bathroom and he asked me what had happened. I told him the whole story and luckily, my teacher is pretty awesome and was totally supportive. Heâ€™s like another father to me. He asked me if I knew who she was but, I didnâ€™t. She didnâ€™t work at the convention because she didnâ€™t have a convention name tag, like all employees and attendees were required to wear. I donâ€™t even think she worked at the university.\n\nAfter that, we went to the closing ceremony. After we left the ceremony, I see the crazy woman again. She gives me this dirty look and I flipped her off. Do I regret flipping her off? Hell no. Iâ€™m not confrontational and I donâ€™t have a mean bone in my body but the way she treated me was abhorrent. When I got home, I told my parents what happened and they were horrified that an old lady, who was more than old enough to know better, was yelling and cussing at a child with mental problems for no reason.\n\nTLDR: I gently shove chair at convention, crazy old woman cusses me out and follows me, I tell her to go to hell, run away, she follows me around an hour later, and I flip her off.",

I've brought my Mum a large Galaxy smooth chocolate bar (one of her favourite types of chocolate) for Â£2.50. \n\nMy sister exclaimed that since I have a full time job I should have spent more on my Mum's present. She is still in college and works part time and said she at least spent Â£10 on her. I believe she got her a piece of clothing. My Dad was listening in on the conversation and appeared to agree with my sister on the subject.\n\nFor Christmas it was the opposite story, I spent Â£12 on a cardigan for my Mum whilst my sister spent around Â£4 on something (I've forgotten what). I didn't care about the price then as it was the most thoughtful gift I could think of at the time. If a gift is worth getting I'll pay the price for it, but I don't see it necessary to spend lots for the sake of it. \n\nMother's Day is yet another day a year which for me has been ruined by capitalism, they're is nothing special about the 31st of March.

Our 7 month old Kitty wakes up around 3/4/5 am and runs around under our bed and zips in and out of our bedroom. She drags noisy toys into the room. Boyfriend sleeps through all of this. I began to turn into a curmudgeon because I just canâ€™t get a solid nightâ€™s rest.\n\n I suggest she needs to sleep outside of the bedroom. He wants her to keep sleeping with us but he offers to get up in the night and put her out of the room. He doesnâ€™t wake up when she plays. I ALWAYS ended up being the one to wake up and put the cat out of our bedroom.\n\nI start to wake up to piles of dirt on the floor around my beloved plants. She ends up killing one of them. Boyfriend does nothing. I reprimand the cat. Boyfriend also lets cat climb on the counters, tables, splash in the toilet, claw at carpets, etc. WITHOUT reprimanding her. He just kind of laughs and goes â€œsheâ€™s a catâ€?. My logic is â€œsure, sheâ€™s a cat but she also needs to be trained.â€? \n\nThis leads me to do a bit of scholarly internet research about training cats. I learn about parasites, fungal infections, bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and so on. (I understand the risks are EXTREMELY low for catching diseases from cats) Iâ€™ve always been a little grossed out by her putting her cat asshole on pillows but this pushes my concern over the edge for germs. Weâ€™ve already had to scoop her up and take her to the bathroom to wash squished shit off her paw. My BIGGEST concern is that Iâ€™m due in about a month and a half and everything Iâ€™ve read says do NOT let your cats sleep in bed with your babies. The cats can unknowingly suffocate a helpless infant. We will have a bassinet and some nights I will be cosleeping because I will breast feed but this is IT, folks. I say no more cat in the bed, PERIOD. My line is drawn because my babyâ€™s safety is my number one concern. \n\n He begins to heavily advocate to have the cat in the bed, based solely on the fact that she wonâ€™t feel like a part of the family if she isnâ€™t in the bed. I remind him that I canâ€™t sleep through the night. I remind him that I donâ€™t want cat shit and kitty litter in the bed. I even tell him that she canâ€™t sleep in the bed with baby around so she needs to be broken of the habit NOW before baby comes so she wonâ€™t blame him for her eviction. All he cares about is her being comfortable. \n\nSoooo, am I the asshole for not wanting the cat to sleep in our bed anymore?",

Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard.  She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.\n\nMy friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. Iâ€™ve paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with our friend group. \n\nShe has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesnâ€™t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.\n\nShe has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyoneâ€™s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyoneâ€™s calls. This was start her loved ones leaving responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called me for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent me into a panic and i had to go track her down in a crying panic thinking my friend would be dead by the time I got there. Every time is has turned out she didnâ€™t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. I have stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass me.\n\nI was already distancing myself a bit because I couldnâ€™t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when I foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so I told her yes but I needed it back in two weeks. She promised me sheâ€™d have the money back to me â€œ100%â€?. She said she needed help because her kidsâ€™ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told me all of this a week later and genuinely didnâ€™t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told me before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying me back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and I heard from a friend she already quit it.\n\nSheâ€™s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday I get a call from her mom asking if Iâ€™d seen her because she hadnâ€™t come home. I say no and automatically know what this is about. The night prior she had texted me bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to our group of friends that heâ€™s not afraid to beat a woman. I knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. I was not surprised at all, I told my friend heâ€™d beat her one day and my friend (who is also one of her bfs) didnâ€™t believe me. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.\n\nIn summary, Iâ€™m caught up because I have suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but itâ€™s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around me or myself. It seems at this point sheâ€™s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which I know can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? I donâ€™t want to be dragged into this anymore. I care about her and her wellbeing but itâ€™s been 10 years of this chaos. \n\nSomething happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call me to talk about it, thinking that I need to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year. It brings a lot of stress onto to me and has ruined a lot of days for me, crying, leaving social setting to go make sure sheâ€™s okay or sitting around in anxiety over how sheâ€™s doing.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to stay friends but not wanting to hear or be dragged into her mess?",

(which I was absolutely not, in fact I was busy keeping the very crabby nap deprived toddler happy and fed, which was actually easier to do while not trying to eat myself at the same time!). He also claimed it was â€œweirdâ€? that I ate my sandwich by myself on the ride home. \n\nPersonally, I thought I WAS compromising by going with what everyone else wanted to eat while still having food that I actually found appealing, from elsewhere.  I felt like he was blowing it out of proportion - not that this was a huge fight or anything, just a minor disagreement, but imo it didnâ€™t even need to be that. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?  Should I have sucked it up and eaten something unappetizing to me?",

            "input": "So, I was a cashier at a restaurant for a while and i recently quit right before Christmas. I worked there for a total of 5 months and during my time there we underwent significant changes in leadership and staff, so most of the people I worked with had quit or been fired by my third month there including several managers and the general manager that hired me. As a result I was switched to a completely different shift and had to work with a bunch of trainees and new employees. \nOne of the major changes made at the restaurant was the opening of a new position called the cleaning captain. His job was basically just to keep the restaurant clean. He had worked under the new GM for around 2 years at a different restaurant franchise (very important detail), so she recruited him to work at our store. \nInitially I had no problems working with the guy, his position alleviated a lot of my responsibilities, so I was given other tasks. Because I had already been trained on the proper ways to do some of these tasks by the District manager (who supervised the store during the management change for about a month, and changed up the protocols for a lot of things) I offered to help him learn the right ways to do things like cleaning windows and bathrooms (which the DM was very strict about). \n\n*I chose to help him because i saw that he wasn't receiving proper training, and was basically being thrown in the pool and told to swim by the new GM, who was a rookie herself.*\n\nSo, after i showed him how to do them properly a few weeks later i noticed that he would slack on doing them (they were supposed to be done every morning) and I would remind him to do them, so he doesn't get chewed out by the GM. I personally would want someone to do that for me, but he started to take it as me bullying him (this is important). So, i stopped reminding him unless I needed to. \n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and we're short staffed because the morning shift manager quit, the morning cashier was fired along with the morning fryer. So, i was put into the position as the opening shift cashier and prep. He was also forced to take on two postions as the cleaning captain and prep helper. \n\nSo, up until then we remained cordial and we would joke around along with the new morning manager and the fry cook. The three of them were way older than me. I'm 18, the morning manager was 37, the fry cook was 27, and the cleaning captain was 38. We would toss around insults and jokes, and they would complain about their struggles in life. \nI would avoid talking about the heavy stuff and  would join in on the jokes, but every time I would join in he'd act like it was a big problem and make it seem like I was picking on him. The only time that i actually picked on him was when I joked about how dumb it looked when he kept the cardboard in his hat.  Other than that I only ever added on to group banter and it was never one sided. \n\nWhen we worked he still insisted that i was picking on him if showed him the proper way to do things , or if I asked him to help me with something. A lot of the stuff being asked of him was outside of his position, but it wasnt me asking him to do it. I  only tried to show him how to get things done more effectively, but he would still whine and complain about me picking on him. I have a low tolerance for whiners and I refuse to be antagonized, so I would defend myself. It got to the point where every time i said anything to him he would make it an arguement.  \n\nI'll admit that I'm not the most sensitive or patient person, so I  tried to explain to him that I'm not trying to pick on him. I was only trying to do my job and help him with his because when he messed up or took too long doing something it would throw off my work and would add to my work load.\nHe didn't take that well and would call me a disrespectful little girl. I don't understand how I  was being disrespectful, or why he felt like he deserved to be treared better because of his age. \n\nAbout a week or so later the confrontation got worse. He would purposely be in my way to irritate me, he constantly accused me of purposely making messes that he had to clean, and he would snap on me if I tried to get him to do his job more effectively and stop making me work harder than neccessary. \nAt some point he started talking trash about me to other coworkers and trying to ruin my image, refusing to help me with things like lifting boxes that were too heavy for me and getting supplies during the lunch rush, and he once told me that he wished his daughter (who died about 6 years ago and was 5 or so years older than me) was still alive so she could beat me up. \n\nThe final straw came when he out right yelled at me because I tried to show him how to fry something faster after waiting on him to get done for almost 20 minutes, so I could do what i had to do before the lunch rush started (I was the only cashier and I also fried chips and stuff, but I couldn't do both during the rush). Later that same day he yelled at me for telling him that he needed to hurry and leave the kitchen instead of lollygagging trying to steal food out of uniform after his shift, because the DM was on her way and would fire him and yell at all of us if she saw him like that. \n\nAfter this incident, I talked to my parents about it and they told me that tbe best thing to do was to go to the GM about it or her boss. I would have gone to the manager that was over our shift first, but she saw everything as it happened and even after I showed clear signs of distress and I told her it bothered me, she never did anything to resolve the issue. She always laughed it of and I found out later that she assumed that we had known each other for a long time and were playing (even though I clearly told her that the way he treated me bothered me). \n\nSo, I told the GM and she got defensive and accused me of being bossy and took his side because she knew him longer and \"he wasn't know for acting like this\". She completely dismissed everything I said, and her solution to the problem was to just have us ignore each other. EVEN THOUGH HIS JOB DIRECTLY AFFECTED MINE. \n\nThe next week my hours were immediately cut in half and i was given fewer days to work, while his never changed. Her excuse when I quit, because it's a waste of time to work 3 hours and day for 2 days a week, as that we weren't bring in enough money and they had to decrease hours. That were BS, because there were part timers with more hours than me. \n\nTL;DR: I was accused of bullying because I wanted to help a newer employee be more efficient. \n\n\n",

My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else?

When we first kissed, we had been hanging out for a majority of the day; we were definitely â€œcuddlyâ€? and flirty to the point where it felt like we were dating, which is something I wasnâ€™t really comfortable with. As I was leaving her room that night, she was the one to lean in first. I was a bit taken aback because I hadnâ€™t really known her for that long â€” so I told her after we kissed that I wanted to take things slowly. She says ok, everythingâ€™s fine, we make out again a day or so later.\n\nNow hereâ€™s what happened. Iâ€™m in class the next week a day before my birthday, and I get a text from her while my phone is off (I usually have it off in class). She knows what class it is and where. When I get back to my room, I turn on my phone and I see the missed messages from her saying that she would be outside my classroomâ€™s building waiting until my class ended with cookies she baked me for my birthday. For the record, I didnâ€™t see her waiting outside the building when I left.\n\nI know you may be thinking: thatâ€™s so nice of her, how cute, etcâ€¦ but I honestly felt like it was weird. I have been in relationships before and this sort of stuff didnâ€™t happen too often, let alone in the first week. Then this girl who I havenâ€™t known for more than a week or so tells me sheâ€™s waiting outside with cookies sheâ€™s made me as if itâ€™s a promposal.\n\nAnyways, I text her saying Iâ€™m sorry for not seeing her messages before and that I was busy, and she responds that its okay. But the whole incident gives me weird vibes â€” from the way she was acting she definitely made it seem like we were dating.

I could definitely tell she was trying to keep things going, but the encounter put me off.\n\nAm I an asshole for ghosting her?",

After it ended early this year, I got back in touch with her to see if there was still some thing there. We tried a couple times to meet, and finally narrowed down a time for me to fly to her city. I checked in with her multiple times before I jumped on booking a trip and place to stay. Leading up to the month, she started sexting me heavier than usual. (Vids, dirty talk, etc)\n\nThe day before I was set to fly though, we talked about the phone and I could tell something was off. We talked about it, and she ended up wanting to cancel at the 11th hour. I respected that decision, but I had some airline credits I wanted to spend that would expire soon from my breakup.

But there was never anu discussion about what we are or exclusivity.  So I ended up hooking up with people I met at some classy lounges I really liked, and I told her about them when we talked about how my trip was going. She started making replies shorter. I could tell, tried to talk about it, but she kept blowing me off. (Again, we had history about talking times we got lucky. Nothing specific, but still.)

This is because they have been emotionally abusing me for the last five years of my life (Iâ€™m sixteen now). My parents constantly belittle and criticize me for arbitrary things that I do. Theyâ€™ve controlled my social life with my friends and tried to isolate me as much as they can. They listen in on the few phone calls I get and keep me from visiting my friends (many of whom I have lost contact with due to the five years of isolation). They have even pulled me out of the public schooling system and have chosen to â€˜homeschoolâ€™ me (in reality, they donâ€™t teach me anything). \n\nMy dad is always extremely aggressive towards me and lacks any sort of empathy for me. He used to be a good father, but he became a nightmare soon after my grandmother died. He tries to intimidate me constantly. He destroys the things I buy with my own money. Just last month, he took away a tablet that I recently bought with my own money that I earned working as a fast-food cashier. \n\nMeanwhile, my mom shows clear signs of being a narcissist. She constantly acts superior to me and refuses to acknowledge any of my feelings. Whenever I talk to her, she always ignores what Iâ€™m trying to say and constantly berates me for â€œnot being good enough.â€?\n\nAs a result, Iâ€™ve resorted to playing video games as an outlet.

I would need to steal some more money in order for me to survive, but Iâ€™d do anything to get away from them.\n\nThe reason Iâ€™ve been stealing the money is to get back at them. Honestly, my parents have made my life a living hell, and I hardly want to wake up in the mornings. They always call me a spoiled brat whenever I play any video games. Theyâ€™re always trying to take away my one joy in life, so I figured I would take away the only thing they seem to care about.

This was mid-day yesterday. When I asked about storing them overnight he first said to leave them in the tied bags. When I asked about oxygen he then told me to put them in a bucket of salt water. Both of these are dead wrong and will kill the lobsters. He sounded unsure so I asked if he could check with someone else, and said that he was the only one there and, \"do you want the lobsters or not?\"\n\nI bought them, because I'm not driving all over upstate NY looking for live lobster.\n\nAfter confirming proper storage I called the store and spoke to a manager explaining that I was given bad advice by an employee who essentially refused to ask for guidance. Part of this was motivated by a desire to protect my investment by getting reassurance that I could refund my lobsters today if they didn't make it (the manager offered before it came up) but I was careful to be respectful and phrase my complaint as a suggestion they train people better rather than a criticism of the particular employee.\n\nMy family says I'm a jerk for jeopardizing this kids job around Christmas.",

            "input": "So a life long friend had asked me to help him in a project of his. He wants to design a website where people can chat about the topic he told me. I told him that I would like to wait and see what becomes of the project first for two reasons. First is that I like to know everything when going into something or at the very least remove most variables when approaching something. His idea is very open-ended and he didn't do a good job explaining what he has in store for the project. Secondly, I just didn't find the premise all that enticing and I wasn't too sure how far he was willing to with the project itself. He is the type of guy who likes to have a lot of different things happening at once. But I don't know if this will be a project with a future or something that falls to the way-side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo further my second point I have to give some context. He told me that he would like me to help him on another project, a book he is writing. He asked for me to read the first chapter of his book and give him my thoughts and criticisms. When I read about 3 out of the 15 pages I gave my honest opinions about something I found weird about the book or inconsistencies in the narrative. After I explained these to him, he simply told me about another book idea he had, instead of addressing my issues with his original story. I asked him if he wanted me to continue reading and critiquing his story and he said yes. So I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later I was on a phone call with him and the conversation shifted to his website idea. That was when I got more of an idea on what he wanted to do. Basically, he was going to interview some people that he met through college. Then he would post the interviews and maybe have a forum where people could discuss their opinions about the topic of his website. I told him that's cool and I am glad he has some sort of vision. Then I asked \"what about after that though\" like what is his end goal with the website. He kinda got offended a bit by saying that people from my state are not go-getters and people always focus on the endgame of projects. He went on to say he thinks people in other states are more quick to jump on board with a project as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got around to reading his story, and so, took about an hour or so reading it, re-reading it, then making side notes on google docs for him to look at. I messaged him and asked him if he thought my critiques were well thought out. He then tells me that he is doing research for yet another project and that he would look at my list of side notes later. It kind of ticked me off a bit that I spent my time to help him yet, because he was preoccupied with other things, he didn't take the time to look over my notes for his story. And still hasn't contacted me about his story idea to this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently he has contacted me again to ask for help on his website. He is using Wordpress to design his website.  He knows I have a lot of free time, seeing as I am unemployed, and that I have some knowledge with computers. He, on the otherhand, does not understand how to use it nor is he that computer savvy. He basically wants me to learn how to use Wordpress and teach it to him. He does preface this by saying, \"if you want to\" and that I would be doing him a huge favor. The only problem is that I turned him down before and he has literally done nothing to convince me on his premise or that he will see this project through. ",

We're both young and broke so we're trying to save money here and there and the house was only partially furnished. On the first meeting with the landlord, we agreed that he still needed to fix a couple things in the house in the near future (there was no interphone, no freezer in the fridge, no smoke detectors!!!, and no showerhead), and because of some legit reasons (we both have insomnia) we asked him to add another bed in the guest room. \n\nNote we asked \"We know it should be on us, but is there any chance you have a spare bed or mattress you could put in the guest room?\", and he said, sure no problem, we'll buy a cheapish one and give it to you for free. We thought we were very lucky and waited. A month passed and finally the landlord said he would come give us the bed on a certain day. At 9pm that day I called and asked if he was still going to come over and he replied that he changed his mind and he wouldn't buy us another bed. \n\nWell, it was rude not to tell us sooner, but it's kind of fair. So a couple days later he came over to talk about the other things he said he would fix and he said he would order the interphone and smoke detectors and then have his own electrician install them, but we had to wait a bit because he was also having his own house fixed. Sure, fine. He also said he would ask his own plumber advice on how to install a showerhead for a cheapish price (quote \"Â£10 and it should be good\").\n\nThen we asked about the freezer, he jumped and said (and it really sounded like a stupid excuse...) that the previous tenants stole the fridge that was originally in the kitchen and replaced it but he had no idea that it had no freezer and he agreed to buy one for us (I checked all fucking local appliances stores and even online and you can buy a small one for Â£70). \n\nDidn't hear from him for another week and I texted him if he had some news. He seemed pissed off and replied \"ordered the freezer\", so I asked when to expect him so that we could be home and he replied \"when it arrives\". \n\nPlease note that I have been extremely polite the entire time and that smoke detectors in the kitchen are mandatory in the UK. We also bought ourselves a lot more stuff that was missing, such as hoover, shelves, wifi hub, wardrobes etc\n\nIdk, are we the assholes for asking for a spare bed in the first place? We've been showering with a fucking spare mug we fill with the bathtub taps for months now and it's kind of scary to know that if there ever was a fire we have no alarm system.",

They only just recently started talking after he moved out of my house after about 7 yrs of no contact with her. He swears nothings going on with her but they talk all the time, even about our marriage. He calls her babe in txts and they say i love you all the time to each other. He swears that this is how they always talked to each other. Hes known her longer than i have and he tells me shes known him longer so she understands him more. We have been married for 8 yrs with 2 kids and together for nearly 15. I trust him when he says they arent sleeping together but i feel that she will try soon enough because she never spoke to him and was almost mad when he married me.  But he swears its not like that and defends her saying im wrong and she wouldn't do that. I said to him that its not normal to talk to other females like this when your in a relationship but he just defends her and tells me nothings going on even though he admits that if i was talking to other guys like this he would be going off his nut at me. But he refuses to stop talking to her cause they have been friends for yrs. Am i the asshole for being pissed off about this?",

            "input": "Iâ€™m currently studying for a Masters. 2x /week weâ€™re put into groups to put together a presentation based on a problem we are given. \n\nIn session 1 we all read the problem together, spitball ideas, talk about what we already know and how it could relate to the problem, and draw up a list of things we donâ€™t know that we need to know to be able to answer the problem. \n\nAt the end of session 1 we split up the questions &amp; go away in our own time to do the research required to answer those questions. In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me â€œso are we using what you did then?â€? Taken aback I said â€œwell no weâ€™ll use a combination, what info have you found?â€? And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didnâ€™t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasnâ€™t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said â€œis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?â€? and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said â€œHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?â€? at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldnâ€™t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadnâ€™t found anything because Iâ€™d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? Itâ€™s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadnâ€™t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didnâ€™t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*",

Lisa is the sweetest girl imaginable, she planned everything through etc. \n\nAt the beginning of December another friend who is also invited and my best friend (let's call her Mary) starts behaving strangely. She doesn't show up to classes anymore, doesn't answer any messages and is being distant. Lisa and I are worried.\n\nMary has done this many times before, ignored us and didn't attend classes at all anymore until something important would come up (i.e. finals) and then she'd be back to normal and behave as if nothing had happened. We know that she is depressed, so we don't push her when it comes to things like this. \n\nBut she stayed silent for a month. I texted her regularily to keep her updated on classes. Around Christmas we all were worried because neither she nor her mother would read or answer our messages and we feared that something bad might have happened to her. \n\nLisa would check on Mary because they lived in the same neighbourhood. In the beginning everything seemed fine, Mary would tell her she was just exhausted. A few days before Christmad however, Mary would close the door on Lisa or not even answer it.\n\nI texted Mary how worried Lisa and everybody was, but she still wouldn't read my messages. Two days before New Year's I decided to call her out on her bullshit.\n\nI know that I could have been more compassionate, but I was really fed up because Lisa would call me daily and cry because she was just so scared for Mary. So I texted Mary that I'm really fed up that neither she nor her mother are answering, that I know she needs time for herself but complete isolation for a month would not help her, at least not in my opinion. And that she could have sent us one message saying that she wasn't feeling well and needed time for herself. I would have been contend with that and left her alone, but like this her behavior was shitty. I also told her she was hurting me with her behavior, because I was worried sick, imagined scenarios of her being in hospital because she hurt herself or even died doing so.\n\nMary didn't answer until the morning of New Year's. Told me that she was disappointed in me calling her behavior shitty and thought I would understand, she didn't feel comfortable texting me because she thought more of me, then proceeded to accuse me of being at fault for since I should have known she was fine. Said my behavior was wrong and she wasn't sure we could be friends anymore. I apoligized but she wouldn't accept it. Apparently it wasn't her fault she was hurting me but my own for caring.\n\nLater everybody was at Lisa's house except Mary. Lisa was crying again, asking me if I had heard from Mary. I told her yes, but I didn't think she would come. Five minutes later, Mary arrives and acts as if nothing had happened.",
