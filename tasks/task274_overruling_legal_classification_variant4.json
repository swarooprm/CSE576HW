    "Definition": "This task will be shown a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence is a statement that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court that establishes a different rule on the point of law involved.",
    "Positive Examples": [

            "output": "overruling",
