Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off      Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot .

They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom .      Even silverware ?      Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient .      I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ?      I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store .

Like stereos and televisions .      How much is the membership fee ?

I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products .      That is a good idea to start with .

It's inevitably etched in my memory .      When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?      Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time .      There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?      I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground .      There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?      I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell .      You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have .

To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?      I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .      Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .      Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .      But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?      Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .      I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?      That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .      Really ?      Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .      Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?      Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .      How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?      That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .      So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?      Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .      Why did they want to found a college ?      Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .      Oh , I see .      Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .      When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?      In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .      It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .      Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .      Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .      Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .      I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .      Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .      That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .      You can ask me any question at any time . ",

I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .      they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore .

Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .      That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .      That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?      Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .

Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time .

But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ?      I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .      I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . ",

Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .      ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .      Zach , what's that on your arm ?      I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .      it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?      just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .      I completely forgot about your cat allergy .

Let's go .      shouldn't we make an appointment first ?      we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .      whatever you say .

I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ?      Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .      My pleasure .      I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ?      A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .      You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price .      Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day .      Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ?      Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you .      8 pm , that's fine with me .      Okay .      So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 .      Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night .      Ok , George . Bye !      Bye , Ann ! ",

But we've just been too busy to look for a house .      We need to find a good realtor .      Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .      What do you mean ?      Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .      But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .      Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .      I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .      Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .      So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?      It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .      And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?      Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .      Why ?      That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .      Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .      It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .      I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .      All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . ",

But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off .      True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .      Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places .      Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed .

Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .      I understand .

I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family .      Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it .      I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out .      OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !      You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ?      Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ...      Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! ",

I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney .      Mm-hm . How long were you there ?      I was there for almost a year .      Oh , OK .      And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .      So , did you , did you lose your finger ?      Almost .      Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .      Exactly .      Will you be going back to Australia soon ?      I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . ",

I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .      That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .      What's to come next ?      If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing .      How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?      From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well .      Thank you . I appreciate all your help .      You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . ",

It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area .      Really ? In New Berlin ?      No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a \" tornado watch . \" That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado .      I understand . They think a tornado might come .      Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a \" watch . \"      And the second stage is called a \" tornado warning \" .      Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a \" tornado warning \" . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere .      It's scary .      Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .      What do you mean \" a loud train \" ?      That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud .      But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?      Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast .      Have you seen a lot of them ?      I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .      Did it hit their house ?      No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them .      What were they doing when you called ?      They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed .      That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ?      Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . ",

And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day .      That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ?      I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office .      I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit .      Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . ",

You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .      The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .      They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's \" chi \" .      But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?      The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .      Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .      This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .      Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .      This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .      Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . ",

I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?      Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .      I know it is quite different from Western chess .      Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .      But isn't it the same with wiki ?      Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . ",

Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students .      I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .      Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .      Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?      Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ?      History .      Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your      Thirty percent ?      Yes .      Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?      Yes . It's an excellent system .      Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?      Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .      I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .      I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .      What ? Are you serious ?      Yes .      But nobody uses Macintosh !      That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma      Yes , I'm from Taiwan .      Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .      But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .      There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple .      Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .      No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .      Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .      You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . ",

Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration .      I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games .      If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes .      Oh , thanks a lot .

Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?      Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area .

The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo .      It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park !      Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants .

Who ?      I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .      What did you do ?      I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .      Did he leave when you left ?      Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .      What did you do ?      He followed me all the way home !      That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .      Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?      Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .      Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !      Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .      I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .      Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .      Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . ",

      "input": "Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ?      I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse .      I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ?      I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .      I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ?      Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it .      All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?      Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .      I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .      Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?      Which country makes the best coffee in the world ?      Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .      I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?      Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .      No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .      I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . ",

How much money do you have in your savings ?      I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow .      well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .      that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .      if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money .      I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! ",

But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .      Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .      In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .      Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout .      And he is English !

We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues .      Well , that is also very efficient , right ?      Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet .      That ’ s boring .

You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years .

Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !      But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors !

Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .      So a deadline will cause that same reaction ?      It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did .

All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages .      Exactly .

It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .      Is it in a good location ?      The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . ",

For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost .      Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else .      That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . ",

Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?      Cinct de mayo ?      No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .      Do we get a day off from school then ?      No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .      Www , man !      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .      Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .      How do you think they could be ended ?      I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .      So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .      It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .      Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .      The problem is that many poor people might suffer . ",

It is always crowded with many people .      why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy .      Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty .      They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors .      I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything .      Me too .

Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties .      Yes , we agreed to that .

The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing .      You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ?      Yes .

It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .      So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .      We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .      I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .      Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .      Thank you .      But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .      That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?      500 pieces .      No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .      All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .      I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .      We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .      No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .      Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .      Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .      Good , that's all then .      Good . ",

Well , it was not like a normal English League match .      No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .      Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye .      Which team do you back then ?      I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .      But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . ",

We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection .      Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests .

In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert .

Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country .

Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell .      Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .      I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes .

This Star Wars episode was incredible !      Why do you think so ?      Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed .      You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures .      It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie .      Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes .      I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling .      I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong .      Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ?      No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak .      Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role .      I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ?      I've no idea .

How would you solve the problem ?      I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .      It would probably be very expensive .      I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement .      It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .      If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .      Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .      The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .      Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . ",

My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .      Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .      It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .      Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .      That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .      And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .      Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .      Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .      They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . ",

Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often .      Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s      Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it .      Mm . What came after that ?      After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals .      Pretty good . Please continue .      Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . .      The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers .      Come on .      Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have .      Any more ?      Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . ",

Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .      That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .      I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .      That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .      Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .      Yes .

If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ?      It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !      It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score .      That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .

Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' .

They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks .      I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year .      Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money .

Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?      I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone .      I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude !      I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her .

Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .      But you taught children , yes ?      Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .      They actually study after school ?      That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .      Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?      Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .      Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that .      So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention .      But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .      As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .      Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ?      That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too .      Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?      I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing .

Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock .      What do you think about the teachers ?      To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring !      That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ?      She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .      Where is she from ?      She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America .      Were you able to understand everything that she said ?      Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her .      She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ?      Yes ... with flying colors !      What does that mean ?      It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !      If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will .      I hope so .      did she give you any homework ?      not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,      no wonder you like the class so much . ",

Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing .

We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes .      I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ?      Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you .      If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . ",

If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .      I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?      One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !      When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?      You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .      What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?      One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .      So I need plenty of space for this exercise .      Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .      Great . Thanks for you advice ! ",

If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .      Sounds like a lot of work !

I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .      That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .      What's to come next ?      If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing .      How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?

I'm quite easy-going .      What's your strong points ?      Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks .      What do you dislike most about your job ?      Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility .      What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?      A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question .      Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ?      Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .      How do you feel about overtime work ?      That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .      What is most important to you in a job ?      I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work .      Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?      I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing .      Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ?      Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .      OK . What are your strong points ?      Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point .      And your weaknesses ?      I think I sometimes try to be over-organized .

No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction .      Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway .      How far is that ?      It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south .      According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London .      That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far .      Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !      Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 .      Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ?      The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ?      22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?      It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way .      We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . ",

The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation .      Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ?      I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs .      One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ?      Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago .      But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans .      I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know .

In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .      In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?      That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul .      I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?      If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .      There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?      Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football .      The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?      Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon .

I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ?      In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .      Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !      A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?      I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it .      Exactly .      So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?      They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .      In what way ?      Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .      You are making me feel really discouraged .      I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! ",

But it ’ s so old .      Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ?      No , not at all .      First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .      I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ?      It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .      Why does he want to do that ?      Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .      Won ’ t they get his inheritance ?      No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .      I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .      So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?      There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that !      That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first .      It would take a lot less time ..      How about this . When you finish the book .

Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .      If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .      How would you do that ?      I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .      I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .      I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .      The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .

It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together .      So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day .      You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape .      Is it official ?      It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . ",

It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening .      I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk .      I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints .      You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover .      Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ?      Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine .      Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money .      Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ?      Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ...      ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not .      Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . ",

Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ?      Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract .      I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China .      Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country .      I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ?      Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . ",

I need a volunteer .      Me ! Me !      Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing .

Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies .      Geez !

It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?      Cinct de mayo ?      No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .      Do we get a day off from school then ?      No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .      Www , man !      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines .      What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ?      I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed .

While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time .

But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?      Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road .

Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital .      What does this mean ?      This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer .      I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing .      Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects .      What special effects ?

Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows .

Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way .

      "input": "Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .      I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .      What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?      Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .      Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?      There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .      Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .      I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .      What are your strengths and weaknesses ?      My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .      Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .      I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .      When do you find a job satisfying ?      My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .      How would your coworkers describe you ?      First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .      Do you have any questions ?      Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? ",

I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .      There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?      I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .      Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?      I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .      Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet      Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched .

Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good !      All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me !

But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change .

We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ?      We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate .

In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before .

I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her .      it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you .      you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .      she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend .      I've given her enough time . I'm over it now .      I still think you two should try to patch things up .      I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . ",

There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .      Is that type of plant found in this country ?      No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action .      So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ?      They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another .      That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too .      That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .      I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .      According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .      That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . ",

This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .      I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well .      Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !      Do I have to pay an installation fee ?

Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .      I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .      You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .      A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .      Then he must be opening his heart to the friends .

You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment .

I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning !      She what ?      Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending .      Four hundred ?      No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?      Ah ...      And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !      Wow .      See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .      If I survive the next six months . ",

Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ?      Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .      I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .      Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller !      Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche .      How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .      You have always been so soft , Dave !      Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out .      Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! ",

I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them .      Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff .      You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ?      You can say that .      But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?      They must have mixed hackers with crackers .      What is crackers then ?      There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them .      So they are two totally different concepts .      Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end .      I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them .      You got it .      Thanks a lot .      You are welcome . ",

No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action .      So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ?      They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle      That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too .      That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .      I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .      According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .

It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area .      Really ? In New Berlin ?      No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado .      I understand . They think a tornado might come .      Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch .      And the second stage is called a tornado warning .      Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere .      It's scary .      Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .      What do you mean a loud train ?      That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud .      But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?      Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast .      Have you seen a lot of them ?      I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .      Did it hit their house ?      No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them .      What were they doing when you called ?      They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed .      That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ?      Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . ",

Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .      But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not .      Definitely .      You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness .      Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .      I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child .      Sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . ",

Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11      I can take it then . I have that time slot free .      Good . I recommend it .

Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation .

      "input": "Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies .      Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?      I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .      I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .      I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .      Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .      In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?      It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .      Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?      If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .      It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .      We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .      If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .      That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that ",

They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background .      But they can see my resume . It's all in there .      I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this .      Ok . What else ?      They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?      I see . What about the salary ?      Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it .      Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot .      Anytime . Let me know how it works out . ",
