Well that situation just changed and we have more $$$ to play with but Iâ€™m not sure how much yet. My SO doesnâ€™t work and choose to stay at home to raise our first kid. Itâ€™s going good. Now with kid #2 the finances change and I got a raise at work so in my mind I want to see what the next paycheck looks like before we start spending more money on things. We have allocated money for everything already and once mint says we reached it, weâ€™re done with that category. We agreed we would wait to see what our new financial situation was. The paycheck wonâ€™t come till the end of the month. SO buys stuff for the kids knowing we have more money in the future even though on the current budget we have maxed the kids spending out.

Once I applied, I told the managers that I could not work on Tuesdays and Thursdays due to me being in college. For the first few months, theyâ€™ve been good with not scheduling me on those days but itâ€™s not until recently that theyâ€™ve started to screw me over. \n\nI decided to take more classes this semester so I can transfer quicker, but because of this I requested a third day off so I can focus on my education. I didnâ€™t give a specific day of the week; I just needed more time to deal with a larger workload. Once I told them that they didnâ€™t seem to happy about it. \n\nThe GM of the store rushed me to learn every position in the restaurant so I can close whatever role they needed that night. Iâ€™ve brought up several times that I need to have a third day off so I can focus on my education, and theyâ€™ve told me that they would fix the next schedule, and they never do. I feel like I ended up being the scape goat of the store, as in whenever someone canâ€™t work a day, Iâ€™ll cover that position until they come back on the schedule. \n\nLast week was the major turning point, as the GM approved 5 vacations for spring break, leaving everyone to work just under 40 hours so they didnâ€™t have to pay overtime and work ridiculous hours. For almost a month theyâ€™ve been having me work weird days, having my off days not work with my schedule but with theirs, and notifying me to clock in later that schedules so they can save hours once I walk in the restaurant. This is causing my grades to drop, my health to deteriorate, and my social life to completely disappear. \n\nI already requested a week off so I can have some time to unwind and destress because this job is literally killing me. At this point, Iâ€™m only working there cause I canâ€™t find another job at the moment and I enjoy being around the other coworkers. I understand that theyâ€™re understaff and that several people have already quit, but that doesnâ€™t justify the managers to completely abuse my availability because they know I need the money. \n\nTL;DR: managers are overworking me knowing Iâ€™m taking more classes, neglecting my requested time off and getting mad that Iâ€™m hitting overtime when they schedule me near 40+ hours a week",

            "input": "My best friend is getting married in May and itâ€™s been the plan all along that her bachelorette would be a weekend away in April. I have helped her plan parts of the trip and was completely on board until this past weekend when she sent me the detailed itinerary of the plans. Iâ€™ve been busy these past few weeks and I know sheâ€™s been working with ironing out the details with another one of her bridesmaids. \n\nSo the new details I learned this weekend that are making me want to back out were:\n\n1. Weâ€™re going away for two nights, not one. I have a full time job and a three year old. My husband is extremely hands on with our son and is totally capable of and will be happy to take care of him for two nights by himself. But Iâ€™ve never spent a night away from our son and I am not sure I want to do it now. I think itâ€™s a lot to ask of my husband. Especially because my friend, as much as I love her, is not the most sacrificing by nature and would never do things that donâ€™t fit into her normal life/routine for me. So I donâ€™t want to go out of my way for her. \n\n2. There are going to be 15 people there, none of who I am super fond of or have anything in common with. Iâ€™ve met them a few times over the last 3-4 years and while they were okay to have a brief chat with over dinner, spending 2 days with them seems like A LOT to handle. I initially thought itâ€™ll be just the bridesmaids so like 4-5 of us. \n\n3. They have plans to go clubbing one of the nights and I just donâ€™t do that. Probably the only person in the group who doesnâ€™t. I donâ€™t drink and going clubbing with 15 people with who I have nothing in common just sounds quite unpleasant. \n\n4. Iâ€™m pregnant and will be 4-months along in April. This adds to the whole not wanting to go clubbing and on long hikes (I havenâ€™t gone hiking in 3+ years) with a large group of women that Iâ€™m not friends with. Hiking features a lot in the planned itinerary. \n\n5. Itâ€™s going to be pricey and Iâ€™m not comfortable spending a huge amount of money on a weekend that I know I wouldnâ€™t enjoy. I would actually be happier giving that money to my friend as an add-on to her wedding gift. \n\nSo how selfish am I being? My plan is to offer that instead of driving there on Friday night, I can drive up there on Saturday and be there for a photoshoot, lunch, hangout and dinner that she has planned and then drive back home. They have a few things planned for Sunday that Iâ€™ll miss but Iâ€™m okay with that. ",

Fast forward about 6 months,  Jâ€™s dad received a job offer which forced his parents to move a further 2 hour drive east, so D and J could not do that due to work commitments, so they moved to an inner city apartment. D had no idea how to move her belongings, even refused to hire a truck so she basically begged a bunch of people. I was one of her only friends with a car so I was roped into doing some of the moving, although I didnâ€™t particularly want to. For me it was a 1 hour drive to Jâ€™s place, then it was a further 2 hours back to their new apartment, and this trip happened 3 times.  Each time she did pay me $50 though. \n\nOne year later, her lease is up and has to move again. During the year contact was sparse with me and D, both busy with various things, then she pulls the same stunt as last year, although after realising how hard moving was, she ordered a truck, but still needed me and another guy to help her move.

But after itâ€™s all said and done, we have a little get together with a few mates the next night and we come to the part where I may be the asshole. So she was just talking about money and debt she owes to people to my friend, and then she mentions that she owes me $50 for the move, then says I should have done it for free as we were friends. This was in reference to the other guy that helped her move, she had known him for about a year and he didnâ€™t accept any payment, just food. I was taken aback a little as I know had the situation been reversed, she would not have helped me and my girlfriend move. My other mate jokingly agreed with her and she took it serious, and has been off with me ever since, but I wanna know your opinion. Am I the asshole for accepting money off a friend who I helped move even though she always complains about money?\n\nTLDR; helped friend move houses several times, received payment, but friends been off with me since another friend didn't accept any payment. \n",

Now at home, my partner is a RE agent and often works from home as well, conducting phone calls loudly, watching the news etc. Iâ€™ve asked, consistently, for the use of headphones so I donâ€™t have to listen to whatever is playing/being spoken of. Hearing training videos or talking news heads is much more distracting than music; but Iâ€™d still prefer to not be subjected to the noise pollution of someone elseâ€™s neighboring operation. The reaction I get is that Iâ€™m asking too much. That my previous body of experience in sharing professional spaces is irrelevant. \n\nA long time ago I worked in a call center where you sit in long rows of people without so much as a cube wall.

My friends heard about it and the two of them said the typical â€œoh shitâ€? and â€œthat sucksâ€? sort of responses. After that, one stopped replying and the other one was actively trying to change the subject and no longer asks how I am or comes off as annoyed or super short when I mention something about whatâ€™s going on (I have two younger half siblings with no dad, so CPS is involved and theyâ€™ve been communicating w/ me a lot because eIâ€™m their next of kin).

I know he isnâ€™t busy because heâ€™s actively online playing Overwatch (heâ€™s dropped 500 sr since Iâ€™m no longer invited to play and he doesnâ€™t have a good healer. I found that a little satisfying to know) and my other friend will ask me whatâ€™s up, how I am, etc but then change the subject super fast if it isnâ€™t in regards to things like video games or streams. \n\nThe lack of communication or concern is sort of really getting to me. I would have hoped my friends would have supported me through this, offered advice or at least lent a shoulder for me to lean on.

When they were through shit I was always there and trying to help them.\n\nAm I an asshole for being mad at them for this? Am I acting entitled?

There are lots of little issues with the place, but I mostly put up with them because there is really no other place for me to live in the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue: Back in June 2018, the fridge that had been here when I moved in failed. I was gone for a few days before discovering this which meant I had a lot of hot, rotten food to clean out of the fridge and freezer. After I cleaned it, I called the landlord and asked him to either fix or replace the unit. He came by a few days later and did so, with a fridge that looked even older/busted up than the last. But I figured whatever, as long as it does the job. It sucked to be out of \\~$100 of food but I was just grateful to have the old, now stinky fridge out of my kitchen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil today, when the replacement fridge broke. Completely stopped cooling/freezing, and I tried trouble shooting it, making sure it was plugged in, the doors were shut etc. But nope, it was just broken. I feel like he just keeps replacing faulty appliances with faulty appliances (repairs/appliances are his responsibility as per the lease). Now I have lost about $200 worth of brand new groceries, and have rent coming up next week. I cannot afford to replace any of these groceries and pay rent. Would it be unheard of/completely make me an asshole to ask to help for food lost because of his bad appliances/have it come out of this month's rent? I did not even consider it the first time, but now I feel like I should ask because this seems to be a pattern and I'm worried that I'm just going to have more ruined groceries in 6 months-year.

            "input": "WARNING - this is a long one!\n\nOver a year ago now, I bonded with a guy in Guild Wars 2 that lived one state over from me in Australia. We got really, really close and in a drunken stupor I basically professed my love to him. We ended up dating, and it was great. We played together all the time, made plans to see each other IRL. It was only an hour's flight and not far enough that we couldn't handle it. We had some hiccups in the relationship, which is that I'm not a really expressive or overly affectionate person. This is a recurring theme, even though I tried hard to work on it because I wanted to be with him, and he had anxiety which made coping with it difficult if he didn't feel like I was investing enough. It's especially harder online because you can't be there physically with someone, so the feeling of emotional distance is amplified.\n\nGW2 was the one thing we shared, and I sort of drifted away from it. There was a series of small events and eventually I needed a break from the game, which is not uncommon for me. I've been playing on and off since release with a few year long breaks after burning out. I'm a very sarcastic and 'shit-talking' type of person. Everyone in the guild took what I said with a grain of salt. We insulted each other playfully and talked shit all the time. I found out later that a girl (she will be important later) in the guild felt like I'd been bullying her. We weren't close and even though I was treating her the same I did everyone else, she didn't reciprocate the same feeling of banter and took it to heart. I felt absolutely awful and tore myself up about it for a long time.\n\nI reached out to her and eventually we mended things, and I thought everything was okay. My bf and this girl ended up getting really close. She had bad depression and they bonded. I'm not the jealous type of girlfriend so I was perfectly okay with them ending up being best friends. Well, it turned out that she was basically in love with him. She flirted with him all the time, and they spent more and more time together. Even though I tried to get him to shut down the flirting, he didn't want to be mean to her or shut her down. It started to make me feel insecure, like I was competing for his time and not able to live up to this other girl.\n\nYou'll recall that I mentioned we were having problems in our relationship. He felt like I wasn't spending enough time with him, that I spent too much time with other people, but he didn't want to play any other game except GW2 even though I was super burnt out. Because video games are how we bonded and it was how we spent time with one another, I tried really hard to get him to try something else so we could play together. He didn't want to, and got upset when I was in calls and games with other people.\n\nWe ended up having a long talk where we discussed where our relationship was going. We mutually agreed that we might not last, but would give it a few more weeks to work things out. The thing that ultimately broke us was when I found out that he had been running a whole bunch of new content with her, even though I had been asking him to play with me so we could spend time together. He was basically brushing me off for her after complaining we didn't spend time together. On top of that, he said she had said things to him like 'you're just being with her because it's easy' and apparently purposefully trying to drive a wedge between us, and she kept flirting, but to my knowledge he never told her off for her behaviour and I didn't want to be 'that' girl who goes off at a boyfriend's female friend. He also made it clear that he wasn't going to stop being friends with her and didn't want me talking to her about it. It felt like he wasn't trying anymore, that he was being a hypocrite, and he just wanted her more, so I broke up with him.\n\nI left the guild because it was too hurtful being in the same one as my ex boyfriend and the girl who ultimately destroyed out relationship. I'd been in that guild for years and played with the people in it for a long, long time. I loved it there, and it was an emotional haven for me on some occasions. I felt resentful that I was the one who ended up leaving, even though I felt as though I'd done nothing wrong, and I still do. But I needed time to heal, and they weren't going anywhere any time soon, so I left. After I did, I sent the girl a rather... nasty message that went along the lines of 'are you happy now? you got what you wanted' and called her, I think, a 'homewrecking sl\\*t'. I was angry and hurt and lashing out, and I don't condone what I said, but there it is. No one said anything to me about it so I thought it might not have even been received (it had been).\n\nMy ex and I remained on OK terms. I owed him some money and was in the process of paying it back, our conversations were casual and pleasant. Once I did, he eventually removed me from social media and whatnot. I was a little surprised but got over it.\n\nIt's been over a year now, and I wanted to start playing GW2 again. I miss the people I played with and I'm ready to put water under the bridge, talk things out, maybe not be friends but at least be able to hang around each other. I reached out to my old guild leader a week and a half ago, who runs a Twitch stream and a public server. He said he was happy to welcome me back, but only on the terms that myself, ex and his now-gf (yes they ended up happily dating), are on okay terms since he didn't want things to be 'awkward'. I was really annoyed about this decision because I didn't (and still don't) think it's fair for me, and just me, to be excluded. I said that awful shit when I left, but I wasn't the only one who played a hand in how horribly everything turned out. I don't think it's fair that me joining back rests on my ex and his girlfriend.\n\nBut I reached out anyway. I've spoken to him and he basically told me 'why would we want you back?' and asked me if I remembered the message I sent his gf after I left. I said I did, but I was really hurt, and that I know it was childish. But I wanted to talk about it and hoped that we could at least settle things and talk about it like adults. I refrained from pointing out that he and his gf also helped to sabotage things and that I'm not the only one to blame for what happened because I don't want to cause a fight and ruin things again.\n\nHe told me it basically rests on his gf because I hurt her the most and whatever makes her happy makes him happy. I've sent her a msg but no reply. It's tearing me apart waiting. I feel awful thinking that they probably see me as this heartless monster but it makes me upset/angry, too, because that's not what I am. I refuse to believe that I'm the sole villain here and I feel like this situation is unfair. I'm willing to give them a chance and I would like the same in return.\n\nRegardless of whether or not I guess back in the guild, I am still going to be in the twitch server, where both of them also talk, so I don't see why it matters. We are going to be around each other anyway, and I would rather have us talk about the elephant in the room than avoid each other til the end of time.\n\nAm I crazy? Am I the asshole, an an asshole? Is it reasonable for me to want to come back after over a year to talk things out? Do you think they're being fair?",

She goes off and says \"This is my fault, I forgot I was in so and so county, I'm from New York where you can say Hi to people!! I'm just a neighbor trying to say hi!! I'm an educated person!!\"\n\nAfter she said the educated person part, I had it.

I said \"oh, so are you insinuating I'm not an educated person because I won't tell you where I live?

She kept yelling after me but I didn't really catch what she said. \n\n\nIf she had said, \"oh, I'm a neighbor, just want to say hi.\" I would have apologized and moved on.

We arrived there and everything seemed great right until I went to the bathroom. My nephew's bedroom was right next to the bathroom and I saw him holding his tortoise upside down, put it on the floor, and pressed his finger on its \"lower side\" and began spinning it. \n\n I've owned a pet tortoise 5 years ago which lived for 2 years until he died unexpectedly. I went over to my nephew and told him it's probably uncomfortable in that position and to stop spinning it and he did. I went to the bathroom and when I was done he stopped spinning it - but now he put it on a pillow and hit the pillow as hard as he can to catapult the tortoise. Thankfully it landed on the bed and not the floor but I was already horrified. I talked to my BIL and slid what happened into a conversation and he told me that it's just a pet and it'll be fine.\n\n So I put a plan in motion and when my nephew came into the living room I excused myself, went to his bedroom, took the tortoise and put in my purse. For context, the tortoise is literally a baby, it's barely bigger than a water bottle cap (exaggeration but you get the idea). My husband doesn't know and I'm debating whether to release it into the wild (if it even can survive after being a pet) or continue to give it a home here without my husband knowing. \n\n AITA for taking it? My BIL and his wife think one of the kids there took it. \n\n ",

            "input": "To start off, I think some background would be helpful. I will say, I don't think I handled this whole situation well, but, well, it's a little late now. My husband Jacob and I have known each other for 5 years, and married for a few months. We live a state away from both of our families, but I've taken a weekend every 2 months to visit my family, while my husband chooses to ignore texts and calls from his family, and only initiates any communication between them if I'm in a group chat with him. This is important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this whole story starts almost 2 years ago. Jacob and I spent a few weeks in the summer visiting his mom and stepdad and while we were there, it came up that his sister would be visiting from a couple hours away. This worried us both because he had recently told me that when he was in high school and his sister was in college, she would sneak in bed with him and sleep in only a tank top and underwear, and then would leave before their parents would wake up. From what he told me, this continued on every time he visited her, or she visited him, unless her roommates were around. The visit didn't go well, he was meant to drop me off at a mall for some shopping because his sister had asked that she get time with only him, but I had been sick for a few days and still had fever and ended up fainting, so he called a friend and asked him to meet me at the mall, and then left once that was sorted to meet with his sister. Jacob was very late and his sister had driven through bad traffic and was understandably annoyed, and tensions rose until she finally left, only half an hour after meeting him. From what I understand, she left crying and called their dad, who then called my then fiance and chewed him out for making his sister upset. He was on his way to pick me up when the call happened, and as soon as he arrived he told me he was leaving to drive to where his sister lived to apologize for upsetting her in person and then stay the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this part is my fault. I was sick and upset that Jacob wanted to stay the night with his sister after what he had just told me, about the sleeping in the same bed, and yelled at him that at some point he had to stop sleeping with his sister. He ended up staying with me that night, and since then his relationship with his sister started to go downhill. She would send snapchats of herself in her bra and underwear and then if he didn't reply back, she would ask why he didn't talk to her anymore. Or, she would post said pictures on instagram or snapchat and then message him again, and this is taken directly from a screenshot of a message, she asked him why he didn't care about what she looked like. I would say that what really upset my husband, was when we were both at a family barbecue at a swimming lake and she pulled me aside to tell me to put some clothes on because my bikini was inappropriate to wear around Jacob, and that I should be more conscientious of what I wear because it reflects badly on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time Jacob contacted her was a few months later, they hadn't talked in months and I thought they should make up and move on, and so pressured him to call her because we were planning on getting married the next year. He called her during her lunch break at work and that ended in her saying to stop contacting her, that he wasn't her brother, that she didn't want to be associated with him until he became a better person, and that she never liked me and that he should make better choices in his life. At this point he completely cut contact with her and blocked her on all platforms. Because of all of this, and his family siding with his sister and bringing up that he was the one that had been creating a problem since he now refused to go to family events if she was there or even call his family because each time he did, they would tell him to call his sister and apologize and move on. We saw her once more at a family birthday party, but at that event she approached him and tried to hug him so he asked her to leave him alone, pushed her away when she didn't move away, and went to talk to the rest of the people in attendance. She then swore at us both, cried, and then as I was walking back to be by my husband after getting a drink, she shoulder checked me, spilling my drink, and almost causing me to fall. I guess the funny part here is that I have 4 inches and at least 30 pounds on her, and was still knocked off balance, which is why Jacob's mother asked me if I'd made the whole thing up. To be honest, I'm not even sure my husband would have believed me if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway now here we are, almost 2 years later, and we've since eloped, due to the family tensions we ended up canceling the wedding, and only his mom and my mom were in attendance as witnesses. Jacob's father got tired of not getting a response, and somehow managed to get my number over the Christmas holidays and began to message me. His sister got an award and the whole family went and he wanted to ask me if I could get my husband to go to the event. I told him I wouldn't be involving myself in this situation, and then on the day of the event, received another message asking if my husband could message his sister a congratulations, and that he had already written it for him and all my husband had to do was copy and paste. Again, he said no, and since then he's spent almost a month writing a message to his sister asking her to take down photos of him on her social media, and letting her know that after all the nasty things that have been said between the both of them, her inappropriate behavior over the summer, and the most recent fiasco at the birthday party, he was officially done with her, and he asked her to stay away from the both of us at family events from now on. She sent the message to both of their parents, and we ended up starting a whole other thing that we hadn't expected, all my husband had wanted was to be able to go to family events without worrying about what his sister would do. The drama finally died down yesterday, and ended with Jacob's father saying I was full of shit and out to hurt his family, and that he didn't need anything from me so I should knock it off. Jacob's mom told us both that we had to forgive and forget because this had gone on long enough and was hurting her and that she understood his sister had done bad things but that she hadn't initiated any contact with us since the birthday party in 4 months and that now we were the only ones causing problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my only question is, in all of these situations I feel like I've been the common denominator, and I know for a fact that had I not informed my husband that the things his sister did were inappropriate and showed him resources from r/JUSTNOFAMILY and r/NarcissisticAbuse, everyone would still be a happy family. I thought I was helping my husband by encouraging him to talk to his family about what his sister had said and done, and by making him go to his family's events, and then finally telling him that it was okay to want to officially end the relationship with his sister and reading over the message before he sent it, but all that's happened is he feels like he's lost his family and I feel like I'm the asshole. I do think he's been happier in these two years of low contact with his sister than in the 3 years I knew him when he talked to her everyday, but I can't help but feel like this is all my fault and I should've just let things go on like they were before. So. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: What was a small tiff with husband's sister has now lasted almost 2 years, and has led to my husband feeling like he has no family left, and me being cut off from his family. Who's the asshole here?",

Natalie was completely obnoxious for the whole weekend. She seemed to view the entire experience as an opportunity to beef up her Instagram. She was taking pictures of random crap the entire time. At one point, she took away my drink at a coffee shop for three minutes as she tried to take the perfect picture of everyoneâ€™s coffee together on the table. Additionally, she was just kind of a party-pooper the whole time. She held Joe back from going places with the rest of us. She made Joe leave places early. She acted in a super immature way with the way she interacted with me and my partner (nothing I can put my finger on, she just was acting like a 14-year-old trapped in a college studentâ€™s body.) And on top of all that, she made some mildly homophobic comments that my partner and I did not appreciate at all. I never really liked her before, but suffice it to say, I was completely disillusioned with her by the end of the trip. \nA few days later, I received a Facebook message from Natalie. She created a group chat of six or seven people saying â€œJoe mentioned a while back that he wanted (thing) for his birthday. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to split the cost. It should come out to $15/person depending on the shipping cost.â€? Someone else in the group chat, my friend Mike, immediately replied â€œlol noâ€? and Natalie removes him from the group. I am very tight on money lately because of the fact that I took a trip to Montreal for spring break so Iâ€™ve been trying to be more frugal. Natalie is from a very wealthy family. She has never had a job in college, and she travels abroad seemingly every other month. I usually buy Joe something small myself for his birthday, and the gift that Natalie wanted to get him is not something that would come from me, as itâ€™s not related to an interest that Joe and I share. So in light of all that, I replied in the group chat â€œiâ€™m sorry but Iâ€™m pretty tight on money! i canâ€™t!â€? Natalie said â€œdamn okâ€? and removed me from the group. Then I messaged Mike to ask him why he said no, and he said he was annoyed that Natalie kept Joe from his birthday party about a month prior to this. Mike and Joe are longtime best buds. \nFinally, just a few minutes ago, Joe and I went to eat dinner in our dining hall, and Natalie arrived along with her roommate and our other friend who came to Montreal. Natalie completely refused to acknowledge my existence for the entire 15 or so minutes we were sitting directly across from each other. As I was leaving, I said â€œbye everybody!â€? and she didnâ€™t look up from her phone. It seems that she is pissed at me for not wanting to contribute to the gift. AITA?",

It's the first one we have been able to spend together, as our first anniversary occured when we were in a LDR.\n\n On the day itself we didn't properly celebrate as he had classes 9-6pm, but he skipped his sports practice in the evening to spend some more time with me, which I was really happy with.\n\nWe had agreed several weeks previously to celebrate on Wednesday, because then he had a full free day to spend with me. But then the evening before he told me he had plans (study plans, so I wasn't really annoyed, just a little saddened) and we could meet up after 4.30pm. \n\nWe live together, so on the Wednesday I decided to wake him up by making him his favourite breakfast (pancakes) and I gave him a card and a small gift- a book he'd been talking about getting for ages. (I don't have a lot of money, my boyfriend is much more well off than me) I also got him roses. \n\nHe was really grateful, but he hadn't got me anything, or done anything special. He said it didn't occur to him to do anything. However, he said seeing as I had put in effort, that he would pay for dinner for both of us, and an activity (VR gaming centre in our town)- both of which we had originally planned upon a few weeks ago. I was really happy, because he knows I don't have a lot of money, so it really helps. I expressed how grateful I was.\n\nHowever, I kind of wanted a card, with a nice message. Obviously I didn't expect a gift after he told me he was willing to pay for the evening, because that was so generous of him. But I kind of wanted something to commemorate the anniversary with that I could keep later to look back on fondly. Sometimes he treats me anyway on non special occasions because he is so well off. (I'm very lucky)  So, I thought a card would make it more \"anniversary\" like.  I also just like the whole romantic messages in it too, haha.\n\nAt the time, because I didn't feel that a card was asking a lot financially or effort/timewise, I asked him if when he came back at 4.30pm he could try and bring me a happy anniversary card. He seemed fine with it, and he brought back a really nice card. I was delighted.\nJ\nBut it's been nagging on my mind today- this guy is normally so thoughtful and generous with his time, and he helps me out financially a lot. Was it selfish to demand extra on top of everything and ask him for a card? Does it come across as me being ungrateful and wanting more and more? What do you think?\n\n",

I trust my neighbor s a lot, I've played online games for three years with these guys and we still play till date, and if anything happens to my pc, that also means they lose a player, which would mean they would have to play with random players which has given them a couple of mini breakdowns through the years. So thereby saying I also have my deterrence.

Apparently I have noticed a classmate of mine that always seem to be down in drains. So one day I decided to help him out as we weren't particularly strangers, I walked up to him and I asked him what was wrong and listened to him patiently. Turns out he was an extremely sensitive person that really cares about people's judgement and gets sad everytime he feels that he isn't doing good enough. He felt much better after talking about his problems.\n\nBut here's where the problem start, a few days later he asked my desk mate to move away so he could seat right next to me, knowing he was very sensitive, my desk mate obliged. The first few weeks were fine, we had a few deep conversations and cracked a few jokes along them. But then it started to get out-of-hand from there, he won't let me talk to other people and feel real sad when I left him. Everytime I talk with a few friends, he drags me back so I could talk with him. He follows me everywhere and overwhelm me with his negativity and pessimistic views about life. I mean I get that he is sad but he is almost basing his entire personality on the fact that he is sad. \n\nBut the real frustrating problem is he keeps bugging me during class. As I said I have a huge test coming up, but this dude keeps cracking unfunny jokes in between that really is a distraction. I told him to stop but he just gets all sad and negative about it. So after an entire month of that, I decided to ignore him for a bit. I moved seat because I have decided that my own wellbeing is the priority but everytime I catch sight of him in the backseat, looking so damn sad and alone, I can't help but feel guilty about it.

Along comes this first-time fic writer with some pretty awful grammar and spelling, whose comments read like a kindergarten kid just learning to make long sentences. Except her content isn't kindergarten-grade, because she writes mostly *explicit* romance fic.\n\nHer works are essentially erotic vignettes straight out of your typical porno flick except with the characters' names tacked on and basically makes for a painful read because they just don't match up to who the characters are actually like in the source material. It even reads like a self insert in the guise of a gender swapped character at times - and considering the characters this genderswapped version is normally paired with are characters she's expressed personal interest in before it's not hard to make the connection.\n\nShe's asked three of my fellow writer friends to help her edit her work since, which has greatly improved the grammar and spelling of her content to be actually readable, but a lot of her \"characterisation\" (or lack thereof) remains in the final work and her fic summaries which she writes herself are her usual typo-riddled style. I tried reading a few chapters of her work just to see how much my friends were able to turn things around, which is truthfully not much.\n\nShe still doesn't know I blocked her and occasionally addresses me in convos even though I never reply. One time she was talking about her newest chapter which she posted earlier when I happened to be online and her beta for that chapter (also a dear friend of mine and a longtime writing partner) remarked good work. The following exchange was paraphrased:\n\nAuthor: You're the only one who's seen it though, the others haven't, how is it good work?\n\nBeta: It's good work because even if they haven't seen it it's posted and finished, something finished and posted no matter the quality is already good work\n\nMe: It's effort for sure, regardless of the result one already put effort into it that counts for something... I guess\n\nNobody remarked on my comment, but the beta DMed me asking me if it was a call-out for someone. I told them it was nothing at the time, but now I wonder whether I was too snobbish and dismissive of someone who regardless of their skill still put time into doing something they love. On top of that I never confronted her with my gripes about her writing and just pretended nothing was different while basically ignoring her. As a writer myself I know how precious support from peers is, even if as a reader I'm very selective. So am I being elitist or just have preferences?",

A year later, my mother finds out from my grandmother that my grandfather was in the hospital recovering from surgery.

How can I, and others like me, be considered assholes for having to drive in the left lane to exit? ",

We wanted to get a house first because my son was about to start kindergarten. We didnâ€™t want to have the wedding and then save another year to get the house in another city and then have to transfer him.\nAnyway, well when I proposed to her. We set a date shortly after to be dated to 2 years later. I told my family and everyone that asked about it the date. WELL, apparently not everyone. Just recently my real brother came to me about some information that my STEP brother was planning to propose to his girlfriend of like 4 months. She already knew about the ring because he showed her it when he got it but hadnâ€™t officially proposed yet. (Donâ€™t ask me why he did that because I donâ€™t know why either.) Anyway, I told my real brother â€œOkay? So what?â€? He then tells me the date they chose, it was exactly 1 week before ours! They were also using the exact same colors as ours too! I told my real brother, no way theyâ€™d do that to us. So I kept my cool about it and we had a family get together and everything was fine. My step brother didnâ€™t bring up anything about it. A few days later I look on Facebook and they posted about the proposal with the exact date my real brother told me about. My fiancÃ© and I are furious! I call my Dad about it and he says he canâ€™t talk right now (heâ€™s with them) so heâ€™ll call me back. I say okay and a few hours go by and he texts me telling me to call him tomorrow which of course makes us even more mad. Because when something like this happens, we like to talk about it right there and then. So I ignore his call the following day because the previous day I was so mad I had to take an ibuprofen and didnâ€™t want a repeat of it. So I call him the next day and I couldnâ€™t believe the words he was saying. Without going into detail he kept defending my step brother over me. He tells me they planned everything including the date before they told my dad and step mother. Even though my step brother and his girlfriend both knew when our wedding was. My dad told me to get over it and itâ€™s â€œnot a big dealâ€? and that if I â€œkeep pushing it, heâ€™s not coming to my wedding.â€? My dad is my best man by the way. I told him â€œwell thatâ€™s fineâ€? and he hung up. My argument is this, what family member does this to another family member? Like, who intentionally rains on another family memberâ€™s parade? My outer family will now have to go to 2 weddings on the weekend in a row, my family is already busy enough on the weekends as is.\nAre we the assholes (my fiancÃ© and I) for getting mad about this?",

            "input": "Ah. Ok. So.\n\nFrom very early on in our relationship, I knew my SO was very headstrong. He told me, his friends told me, his family told me, it's also super obvious, I'd seen it in action. We agree on the big things so it's ok - we were always completely aligned in our political beliefs, religious beliefs, family future plans, etc. All the important things. And the little things? Well, I'm the least headstrong person so it didn't really bother me, because we weren't really butting heads. But it does effect me. I will focus on 1 example below, but just know that this stuff happens all over our life - with stuuuuupid little things like colours, apartments, kitchen supplies, music, tech, what to watch on Netflix, whatever (nothing major though). Anyway, for this main example though, all you have to know is that I like mushrooms (I think).\n\nMe: \"Hey, do you want mushrooms for dinner? I love mushrooms.\"\n\nHe says, \"They're disgusting.\" \n\nI say, \"Really? What kinds have you had?\" \n\nHim: \"All of them. They're disgusting.\"\n\nMe: \"How were they cooked? Poorly cooked mushrooms can get a bit gross.\" \n\nHe says, \"No, I've had them all ways. They're disgusting.\" \n\nMe: \"Ah. Well, I really like them...\"\n\nWe now don't eat mushrooms ever and it's cool and I never bring it up. Don't want him to feel bad and I'm not going to force someone to eat mushrooms who could be allergic, you know? I'm very careful about picking/ordering food with no mushrooms when I can be. He tells waiters he's allergic to them when we go out to eat so that he doesn't get them in his food. I never buy or cook mushrooms for myself, which I used to love. Every time mushrooms come up he says they're disgusting and I began to associate this in my head. So naturally I stop eating mushrooms, and years pass, we get married, move to a new country together. I hate mushrooms now. Yes, that is on me - I'm way too easy-going/steamroller/influenced/people-pleaser or whatever other names you'd like to throw my way. Go ahead. I take responsibility for that, and I'm working on it, and I'm trying to be more in touch with my needs and what I want. It is difficult to just turn off. As I'm becoming more aware of this issue, I'm re-evaluating how we talk to each other and express our needs. I decide to ask him to disagree with me more respectfully and be more aware.\n\nHe doesn't really understand. He thinks that stating his own opinion shouldn't influence mine and it's not his fault at all - it is just all in my head. He says this, a lot. He's very much one of those people that always tries to be logical and remove emotion from situations. I do believe he's right; his opinion shouldn't influence mine. I agree in theory. But still it does. There is part of me deep down that just wants to please him because I love him and I'll always pretty much acquiesce to whatever he prefers to make him happy, I'm working on turning it off and getting more confident in myself. I'm asking that we both become aware of this, and try to adjust our life accordingly. I don't want him to stop expressing his opinions - I just want him to be aware of how he does it and try not to dismiss me and my opinion in the process. He doesn't understand. I start seeing a therapist.\n\nI'm working on myself with this therapist. And I enroll in a mindfulness group, where I talk about this issue regularly. I'm trying to be really critical and evaluate my self-confidence and practice exercises they give me to look at my needs and what makes me happy and try to express them and be more vocal. Sometimes, I am doing better and I tell him my opinion. But whenever he tells me his opinion, if it is not in complete agreement, I feel like he always gets his way. Furthermore, the way he says, 'Mushrooms are disgusting. All of them. They just are.' without ever acknowledging that maybe they're just gross for him and not gross for everyone is unfair. He'll say 'X is right. X is the only way' and if I think Y, well, he's so confident it just floods me with insecurities and questioning my own self. Yeah, sure, that's not his fault, but also, it's not exactly my choice either - why can't we try to work with communicating our wants and needs together? Why do I have to be AS headstrong as him if I ever want my opinion to be heard?\n\nAnyway, to summarise all of this up, years later, after we are married, I'm helping his mum prepare dinner and I discover she's put mushrooms in the egg rolls she's made. He goes to grab one, and I go, 'oh don't! You can't eat it! It has mushrooms in it.' and he goes, 'Nah, my mum knows how to make mushrooms edible.'\n\n...\n\nAITA for feeling completely gaslit and also enraged that he can't be like, 'oh mushrooms aren't my thing but it's ok you like them' or even 'i only like the way my mom makes mushrooms' rather than telling me that they're just always disgusting so incessantly that I literally feel incepted that they are and get nauseous at the thought of them??? AITA for wanting him to express his opinions in a more respectful way, and to be aware of how hard it is for me to disagree with him because I am a spineless jellyfish?? (Also, am I actually crazy here?)\n\nAnyway, that's mushroom-gate. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Please tell me. Am I the asshole?",

Then the last week of February she tells me she wonâ€™t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. Iâ€™m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldnâ€™t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. Iâ€™m wary but I say ok but youâ€™ll have to pay me back. No real response.

We agree and disagree on many topics, and have had lots of great discussions and not held our differences against each other.\n\nShe is obese to the point that it is physically disabling. People are generally judgmental and rude about this which has had mental and emotional impacts on her for a very long time.  So a few months ago when she told me she met someone and they were dating and he was really helping her feel better mentally, emotionally, and physically,  I was really happy for her. \n\nA few days ago she told me something that changed everything.

I feel so bad for his wife and to be honest, I'm questioning my friend's judgement/feel like he is using her since she was so open to his affection.   \nWe'd discussed adultery as an abstract theoretical concept before.

I told her I strongly disagree, that sounds super toxic/dishonest/a path to a shitty relationship, but I'm not in a relationship with her so I wasn't really concerned that we disagree on that topic.   \nThe day after she told me this we were going to meet up for lunch until she texted me he was going to come along.

We're lesbians. I asked her to marry me six months ago and our wedding will be held in a year and a half. We're extremely excited, planning on having kids after the wedding and so on. She's everything I've ever dreamed of and knew from the first time I saw her that I'd make her my wife someday. She knew that as well. There is just one thing bothering me in our relationship. \n\nMy fiancÃ©e has a male friend, let's call him Hank. Hank is tall, his clothing and hair style is \"psychobilly\" and he lost his virginity at 26 by having sex with the 17-year-old daughter of his best friend. After that, he started a false rumour that the girl gave him chlamydia and he hasn't had sex since. He has also been unemployed for a long time, because according to him, he doesn't know how to make a CV. Y'know, the kind of a person I wouldn't want to hang around with. Hank is now 27 as well and was a co-worker of my fiancÃ©e aboutÂ six years back, when we hadn't met yet. They became friends and have hung out ever since. However, another co-worker of theirs at that workplace at the time jokingly said to Hank that my fiancÃ©e had a crush on him, which is impossible since she's a lesbian. Hank, for some incomprehensible reason, believed it to be true. \n\nEver since then Hank has harassed my fiancÃ©e by saying stuff like \"I'd be the man of your dreams\", \"You just haven't tried my dick\", \"I love you and would make you happy\" etc... He insists that my fiancÃ©e should sleep with him in order to find out how amazing of a person he is and it doesn't matter that my fiancÃ©e is not interested, because according to him, starting a relationship with him would change how my fiancÃ©e sees him. He also demands she sees him at LEAST three times a week, and plays martyr (\"you're a bad friend, I'm so lonely, nobody wants to spend time with me\") when she doesn't. She feels horrible whenever Hank does this and doesn't understand why he can't just shut up about it. She's told him multiple, even hundreds of times that she is not interested and will never be. He doesn't accept that. This has gone on for about five years. \n\nNow, he isn't this bad all the time. The reason my fiancÃ©e hangs out with him still, is that he can be nice and not speak about that nasty stuff for a while and they share the same passion: cars. They can have a really nice time together and he might go for about a month without harassing her, but then start the bullshit again. \n\nHowever, I feel extremely annoyed and even hurt that my fiancÃ©e still hangs out with him. In the past she has cut all contact with him but when that happened, he started visiting her parents all the time, begging for them to reach out to her and ask her to \"be his friend again\". My fiancÃ©e says that she never wants that to happen again, as she doesn't want her parents involved. She has blocked him everywhere except instagram, through which they can plan to meet whenever he's being nice again. I have suggested that she could get a restraining order against him, but she says she doesn't want to hurt him and he's the only person she can talk about cars with. \n\nI told her this feels like she'd rather keep hurting me than hurt him. She said that she feels bad and if it comes to that, she will cut all contact with him. Just now she texted him and told him that if he ever talks about his feelings again, she will cut off all contact with him. \n\nAITA for wanting my fiancÃ©e to stop being his friend? If not, any advice? \nI feel extremely disrespected but also guilty when my fiancÃ©e tells me he's the only person with whom she can talk about cars. \n\nShe read this text before I sent it to you guys so we're very open about the situation. \n\nTL;DR: We're lesbians, getting married in 2020. FiancÃ©e has a male friend Hank, who won't stop sexually harassing her and insisting that she should sleep with him. FiancÃ©e doesn't want to cut all contact with him, because he can be nice at times and he's the only friend she shares her car passion with. I feel disrespected. AITA for wanting her to still cut all contact with him? \n\n",

The RA came in and told me my roommate said I have no manners and I am too loud while he is trying to study.

It was not the only time she backstabbed me but this action is the most relevant for the story as it had a large impact on me and my trust issues towards her.\n\nI forgave her.\n\nFast forward to the current point in time and all of a sudden the two of them are really good friends. After months of not talking, the relationship between them has gotten to a point where they are constantly texting each other, talking about everything and spending a hell lot of time with each other. He has even slept over at her place a few times.\n\nNow, I talked to both of them about the situation, telling them that it makes me feel uncomfortable, mainly because of what had happened between them already (I didn't scream or curse at either of them). My boyfriend said he felt sorry and that he would spend a little less time with her (I later told him that I didn't want to impair his social life). My best friend, on the other hand, started crying, claimed that I hurt her feelings and that she was at the brink of ending our friendship because of what I said.\n\nI told her that I was sorry and we continued acting normally again.\n\nA day later, while I'm talking to my boyfriend on discord he tells me about how he's going to sleep over at her place. I texted her, saying that I think it's a bit inconsiderate of her to just disregard everything I just told her the day before. She then got really angry at me and told me to stop forcing my boyfriend to stay away from his friends (which I have never done, not even when it comes to her) and how I'm a complete asshole who just thinks about herself while humiliating her and constantly hurting her feelings. At this point I was pretty mad too and noted that she should stop getting pissed off because I was hurt over a mistake **she** had made. I didn't get a response for a while, because apparently she spent the day with my boyfriend. A few hours later I got a passive-aggressive apology and, once again, we started texting normally afterwards. At this point I was tired of getting into a fight everytime I tried to express my feelings so I just dropped the topic and never brought it up again.\n\nYesterday, I talked about something revolving around the relationship I had with the ex I mentioned above. The story didn't even involve her but she immediately started getting angry again and said something along the lines of: \"I'm just gonna act like you didn't just reproach me for doing something two years ago again.\"\n\nLuckily, it was pretty easy to avoid conflict by just explaining what I meant but what she said in that situation has sticked with me. I just don't know anymore, am I overexaggerating or is she just inconsiderate? Am I the Asshole?",

She's a bit older than I am [I'm 20, M and she's 24] and we are super good friends. It's not uncommon for us to go for a beer after work, as we usually do night shifts together. \n\nThere's this other girl, let's call her J. J and M are about the same age, and J started working here around December. Now one thing about Starbucks (at least, where I come from) is that dating other baristas are not allowed, because it always leads to tension and drama. I've experienced this firsthand in my previous store, and it was a really awful experience. \n\nSo the tea is that M and J have been having sexual relations for the past month or so. M told me last night when she was quite drunk. The other problem is that M has a boyfriend and J has a girlfriend. I really didn't know what to say, because I think infidelity is a pretty awful thing to do when you're not in an open relationship and I didn't want to go through the whole ordeal that is workplace romance again.\n\nI personally decided to put an end to this. I didn't know what else to do.\n\nI talked to my assistant manager the next day. She went really quiet and told me she appreciated my confidence and that she would talk to our store manager to see if M or J can be transferred to another store, and that they can handle it in a private, respectful manner. \n\nAITA for meddling in a situation that wasn't my business and breaking my friend's trust like that?",

I am a Lebanese-Arab, so I have pretty curly, dry, thick black hair, and also have a pretty big forehead. Whenever it comes time for me to get a haircut, my mom always wants me to get a short buzzcut, but I prefer my hair to be a little bit longer, maybe an inch in length. The thing is, whenever I tell her that she says that I look stupid and disgusting, even I think it looks perfectly fine, and a lot better on me than a short ass buzzcut. I even showed her a picture of my grade 10 picture just to prove it looked fine, but that made it worse. I tell her Iâ€™m 15 years old and that itâ€™s my hair so I should be able to choose how I want it, but she starts screaming and insulting me, to the point where my dad will literally have to drag me out of my house just to go the the damn barber. And whenever I go to school after I get my haircut, I usually get made fun of for having such short hair and a high ass hairline, which is so high it looks like Iâ€™m balding, and I have told her this but she just doesnâ€™t care and gets even more mad. I just feel like most kids my age wouldnâ€™t have to deal with this, and it is unfair for me. Nearly all the guys I know have long hair, while I have to fight to the death just to keep a fucking inch on my head. My mom isnâ€™t even talking to me because of this.

My mom wants to control every aspect of my life, from liking girls to where I go for university to even my own fucking hair. Iâ€™m so fucking sick and done with this. This is so frustrating.",

I noticed that she was a bit overly happy and perhaps a little clingy, but I first figured that was just her personality so I did not pay any mind to it. So only a few minutes after meeting her, she wanted my snapchat information. I figured it wouldn't hurt anyone so I just gave it to her and we exchanged info. After the prom, she started sending me about 3-4 snapchats everyday. Some of them didn't even make sense, like just her drinking a starbucks or something. I did not know how to respond to these so I would just go like \"haha\" or something. I would also get random DMs from her saying like \"just broke up with my bf\" and like a crying emoji. Again, I don't really know how to respond to something like that. I had subtle thoughts that maybe she was into me or something but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and just thought that maybe she just had an eccentric but harmless personality, so I would just respond to everything she wrote to me with like a laughing face or a thanks. She then responded to a picture of my dad from when he was my age saying \"now I know where you get your good looks from. \" Again, I just responded laughing and saying thanks. She then started to calm down a little bit with sending me stuff but would still periodically do it.  She has been doing this for two years now until I pretty much put a stop to it last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor halloween, I posted a picture of me dressed up as Buddy Holly. Not too long after, she DMed me saying \"OMG you are so cute pls be my bf.\" Hoping that she was joking, I just laughed and said that I was glad that she liked the costume. She then responded again saying to be her bf, and then I responded with the textual equivalent of a nervous laugh. She wrote back saying \"I am guessing you are not available then :(\" I just told her that I couldn't and then blocked her after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole for blocking her but the reason this situation made me so uncomfortable is because I barely even know who this girl is and the only time I ever actually met her in person was for that 5 minutes. Also, the constant notifications and snapchat photos were getting very annoying, and the messages were making me feel weird.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you guys have done the same thing or should I have approached the situation better?",

My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped weâ€™d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but weâ€™d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that weâ€™d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isnâ€™t that big of a deal because itâ€™s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said thereâ€™s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregoryâ€™s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didnâ€™t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadnâ€™t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didnâ€™t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and thereâ€™s no one else sheâ€™s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasnâ€™t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldnâ€™t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party.

Only, I made the mistake of asking her to \"hang out\" instead of explicitly asking her on a date. She said yes, but the next day I found out that she did have a BF. I thought \"that's fine, she's a cool person and I like having friends.\" We didn't hang out, though, and I never persued hanging out with her outside of work again. I did feel like I had caught a bit of the feely feels, but I figured I'd get over it and things would be kosher. I know a lot of women who I value as friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut we did talk a lot. Our positions at work caused us to spend a lot of time together talking alone. The more I got to know her, the more and more it became obvious that we had some pretty bonkers stuff in common. Tons of stuff in common. I started to feel like I had never met anyone like her before. I fell for her pretty hard, and I was in way over my head emotionally before I realized it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, she left that job, but we kept in touch over FB messenger pretty often. My feelings grew to the point where I just couldn't get her out of my head. I became very, very depressed and started seeing a therapist for the first time in a long time. It highlighted the fact that I depend too much on others for happiness. I felt like I had to disconnect from her, and that there was no way for us to be friends without it being a toxic, one-sided thing. I didn't want to feel like I was leading her on in a friendship way for too long, and I felt like it would be best for both of us if we weren't friends while I tried to work on my co-dependency issues and my obsession with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she was already involved with someone and she seemed happy with what she was doing on that end, I didn't want to tell her about my feelings.

I felt like she was owed an explination, but I didn't think I should tell her about my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut one day, she texted me, agressively asking for an explination.

            "input": "Hello, all! First time posting to this sub, so I hope everything is in order as far as the rules go. I'm sharing this story to find out who is *truly* the asshole in this situation. I know this may seem kind of petty, but it has been bothering me for a little while now. This post will be a bit long, but I will include a TL;DR at the end.\n\nA little backstory: In the Fall term of 2016, I enrolled in a local University along with 2 of my friends. I keep to myself most of the time, going with the flow, and only speak up around friends or when I truly feel like I have something to add to the conversation among strangers, so finding a friend that first semester was kind of difficult. One of my friends introduced me to the asshole in question (AIQ from now on) about 2 months into the term. Everything seemed nice enough in the beginning, and we became friends in the spring semester after taking a foreign language class together. Jump to the fall term (2017), when my teacher announced an upcoming study abroad opportunity in the summer (2018). We were both excited to go, as this could be our only chance of going to a different country (AIQ is a STEM major so she was worried about spending a full term away and how her classes would be, and my mom would not allow me to spend a year away from home since it was my first time going out of the state). Both of us saved up to pay the program fee (faculty-led), deposits, and multi-city plane ticket (we studied abroad in 2 countries that summer). All the while during our free time in class, we talked about how much we couldn't wait to go, what we hoped the cities to be like, where we would go during our free time, etc. Now on to the events that transpired and what led me to cut ties with AIQ.\n\nIn the first country, everyone got along (along with the AIQ and I, there were 11 other people - again it was a faculty-led program, meaning that the foreign language instructors from the university went with us so there wasn't a bunch of people they had to look after). However, when we arrived in the second country, everything kind of turned to shit between the AIQ and I. It began with the AIQ getting snappy and rude with me whenever I asked a general question, even when I wasn't talking to them in particular. If I suggested we do something, she'd say \" we already did that yesterday without you\" or \"we're tired of doing that\". We had to share a room together in the second country, and she held on to the key because she could attach it to her wallet and we thought it'd be easier than trying to look through my small bag in case it sunk down to the bottom. Twice, she came back very late (at around 11:15, which was later than the teacher wanted us to be out), so I waited in the shared space of two other group members until she came back (which was around a 30 minute wait). The first time, she was very apologetic, saying that the train was late (very unusual considering that the trains in this country run every 5 minutes or so), but I accepted her apology. The second time (only two days later), she just huffed past me, unlocked the door, set her bags down (she had went shopping again), and didn't say a word to me until the next morning. As each day passed, communication between us became very limited. Me, not talking to her because I really didn't want to deal with her attitude, and her, for whatever reason she had made up. She only had this attitude with me and she treated the other group members with friendliness and were open to what they wanted to do (although she claimed she disliked two of the other group members, she didn't have an attitude with them).  \n\nShe kept that attitude towards me until we departed for home. The remainder of that summer, I didn't speak to her at all- not even a text. When I saw her again this semester (we take the same foreign language class now), she acted like nothing was wrong and even hugged me- something that she'd never done. We talked about how our lives were so busy now that we've begun our upper level course work. After that first day of class, I didn't talk to her very much because now I know what she is truly like. Friendly at first, but very rude and condescending once you've spent time with her.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not talking to a friend after she was mean to me when we studied abroad?",

This check should be done every night by the closing manager, (this manager is fairly new and this never happened before)\n\nBy 2AM i had had enough, it was when she said \"basically all equipment needs to be pulled out\"... i was annoyed at this sudden expectation which dismissed the fact that we didnt know about this audit, and was simply an expectation for her own benefit, she explained that it isn't her fault that we didnt know about the audit, and the these things should be getting done regardless, and that if it isnt a good audit its her who gets in trouble. \n\nThe manager ended up saying \"just go home then\", this was more directed to me as the other 2 kitchen guys weren't saying anything, and so i left alone, shortly followed by the other 2 about 10 minutes later.\n\nI know this sounds very biased, and thats why im asking, i was upset at her thinking i would be quite and go along with her \"this is my high expectation, regardless\" notion, which simply isn't the case, the worst part is, as i was leaving the kitchen to clock out i was walking just behind this manager past the bar, on the way to clocking out we passed some bar staff, and im unsure if she knew i was behind her but she said to one of the bar staff \"were not getting a bonus because they cant be bothered to clean the kitchen\" i said something along the lines of \"yes its our fault for not being informed of this audit\", and then she asked for me to come to the office in private and said some of the following \"i will not have you talking to me like that in front of staff\" \"do you know who youre talking to? im your manager\"",

My question is pertaining to something that happened yesterday ( and many more stories like this) while leaving our 2 year old son with her, I had him pick a flower and take it to her. She saw this all happen, and when my son handed her the flower her response was to yell at my husband saying how he should learn from our son and give her flowers all the time. (Of course, special days deserve flowers even though they don't celebrate mother's day) but to just automatically go straight to telling her son it's his job to get her flowers frustrated me.. (isn't his job to get his wife flowers randomly?)  We've had similar situations to this. I.e. when I made a post about him being my king (mi Rey in Spanish) and she commented on it, saying he was HER king. One night my husband and I were talking and she came and interrupted completely and my husband told her to wait until we were done talking, and she flat out said that he needs to stop his conversation with me and talk with her, and that he SHOULD LOVE HER MORE. no, he shouldn't love either of us more, it's simply a different kind of love. Sometimes I simply don't know if I am being immature or just don't understand the culture, but I feel she doesn't respect me or my role at all, and expects her son to be more like a husband..than a son to her. :(",

In 2018-2019!).\n\nAnyways, things have been going pretty well, and I'm happy to have made a new friend.Â  The only problem is, I can not STAND hearing him eat.Â  I'm very sensitive to \"mouth-noises,\" and the sound of someone opening their mouth while chewing is one of the most uncomfortable sounds I've ever experienced; it's like nails on a chalkboard times 10 for me.Â  It's not something I can think away either, it's an uncontrollable physical response to hearing someone open their mouth while chewing.\n\nNow I realize that this is MY problem, and I don't want to tell anyone how they should eat.Â  And I've also avoided the situation a few times by just not eating with him.Â  Except there have been many times when I'm hanging out with my other friend (his roommate), and he'll sit next to me on the couch and eat his dinner, and I'll be crawling out of my skin with how uncomfortable I am.Â  I even lean as far away as I can and nonchalantly cover my closest ear, and it's still not enough. He is honestly the loudest chewer I've ever met in my life.\n\nSo here's the question: WIBTA if I talked to him about it?Â  He has OCD and I have OCPD tendencies, and he and I have talked about our \"things,\" so I feel like bringing it up in that context might work?

Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, â€œoverloading the babyâ€™s little bodyâ€?. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how sheâ€™s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. Sheâ€™s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she canâ€™t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless sheâ€™s somehow positive for it. (Sheâ€™s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly Iâ€™m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but Iâ€™m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesnâ€™t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. Iâ€™m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nSheâ€™s up in arms about this now saying how Iâ€™m being manipulative and abusive because Iâ€™m giving her ultimatums over this.

Suddenly sheâ€™s not. \n\nI donâ€™t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show itâ€™s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, sheâ€™s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past sheâ€™s said how itâ€™s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (Iâ€™ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, Iâ€™m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines donâ€™t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. Sheâ€™s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her.

My parents are life long cigarette smokers and drinkers. My dad especially. They allowed my to become an addicted smoker from age 16. I missed out on many opportunities because of it. \n\nI always had a special connection with my dad. He taught me about music and history and how to think level headedly. He was always so forgiving and caring and loved unconditionally but he was a complete alcoholic and coward when it came to my mom. \n\nMy mother, is a complete narcissist and wack job. Life was awesome until she quit taking her xanax in 2013 and told NONE OF US. So we we're just left to deal with her mental abuse. She would \"ground\" me, well after age 18, so she could keep control over me. She attempted to make me quit several jobs. I had to sleep in the car that I owned because she would try to take my keys from me to prevent me from going to work. My dad was called a lazy POS everyday even though he contributed 50% to the household. One night, I was already preparing to move out with my boyfriend, She thought it was time to informed me (drunk as a skunk and with a huge smile) that she was having an affair with her boss. The man she had been calling a \"creep\" for over 2 years. My dad and I have had a history of getting into bad fights over my mother's behavior. He just won't stop defending her actions. And he wont let me confront her, without a fight. \n\nSo I just left. No fight, nothing. I left and cut off every form of communication. I also cut off my grandmother because she would turn around and tell my parents everything I was up to.  I still don't know if my dad knows about the affair but that's was the straw that broke the camel's back. I still don't care if my mom dies tomorrow, she's a fucking cunt and a whore for doing that to the only person that has ever loved her unconditionally. And the fact that she behaved like she was holier than thou towards us at home, and doing that with her boss. Fuck that bitch, I hope she rots. \n\nI'm very torn right now, because of my relationship with my dad I don't think I could live with the regret of never speaking to him again. His drinking became worse after I left. I refuse to blame myself for that. I recieved a message from an online account I can only assume she set up for him (my dad's old school, he'd never open a facebook if he even knew how) that informed me he has congestive heart failure (shocker) and is in the hospital But that women is going to be involved in everything I try to do involving him and make everything about her. And I don't want his last memory to be of me verbally shoving my foot up his wife's ass. Especially if he doesn't know. Im also not interested in a relationship if he makes it through. I just don't know what to do and I feel horrible. The rest of my family is just as bad as my mother and don't care whether he lives or dies. \n\nIf you read all of this, bless you. This is all I have to go to. \n\nTL;DR : Cut ties with both parents because mother is a psychotic adulturous whore and dad is alcoholic fool. Had special relationship with Dad and wants to see him but knows adulturous whore will make it all about her.\nTorn to pieces. ",

He can't speak, but he was an okay kid until puberty hit him. Now he's gotten more aggressive, yelling and screaming and putting holes in the wall of his bedroom. Therapy and medication isn't helping, and I can't stand the yelling. I tried to be patient with him and ignore him but he pushes me so far that I start screaming back at him. It's gotten so bad that I had to start wearing earplugs whenever I go downstairs, and I spend most of my free time in my room. Sometimes, when my parents aren't home, he targets me specifically for no apparent reason and screams up the staircase to my room until I either lose it and start screaming back or I go to my car and leave. Last time it happened, I just locked myself in the bathroom and cried. Despite my parents being in the same boat and arguably have it worse than me because they're responsible for him, they obviously don't know how to help me as their advice to me either boils down to \"ignore him\" (which never works) or \"calm down\" (which upsets me more). My brother shows no signs of improving and I doubt he'll ever talk at this point. It's gotten to where I can't stand living with him and want to leave home. My mom picked up on this and started crying to me about how she doesn't want me to leave because of my brother and that I would be throwing away the rest of my childhood if I do because then I'll have to step into the adult world. I broke down in front of her and told her I wouldn't leave but I felt manipulated afterwards and was angry because she wasn't taking my feelings into account. Now I'm calling those feelings into question. Maybe she wasn't trying to manipulate me and just wants the best for me. But on the otherhand, I feel like my childhood is already gone.

We were both really goofy and got along well.  My friend had a rabbit called Boingo. At the beginning of 5th grade, her family was going on a trip to Hawaii and needed someone to babysit their rabbit, so they asked our family and we accepted.  So for two weeks we took care of the rabbit, which was super fun. She and her family were really thankful.\n\nA little bit further into the year, she brought Boingo to our class for a visit, because elementary kids love rabbits. It was a pretty big hit.\n\nNow the actual event.  At the end of the year, our teacher organized a big party for the last full day of school.  One of the things we were going to do was a bingo game where all the things on our boards were our favorite events from the year.  We spent the day before coming up with ideas, and of course Boingo's visit was one of them.  There were a lot of choices to put on our board and I didn't really want to decide (we made our own boards), so I just went down the list on the whiteboard and put every other one on my board.  In the process, I missed Boingo. \n\nSo we play our bingo game and our teacher calls out Boingo.  My friend was sitting next to me and noticed I don't mark anything, and gets really upset.    She starts saying things like \"How could you forget Boingo?!\", \"You babysat him!\" and \"You should have put Boingo on your board!\". I realized I may have made a mistake and profusely apologized, and tried to explain how I chose what to put on my board, so it was an accident.  But she wouldn't even hear it.  She blamed me personally for not putting Boingo.  \n\nThere's two things I remember about this.  One is I became so upset I started crying, but she didn't even care.  The second is what she said after I kept trying to tell her it was an accident. \"You should know not to argue with a girl, because they'll always be right\"\n\nTo this day, she made me feel like such an asshole for not remembering something significant to me and her, even though I feel it was just an accident and shouldn't have been a big deal.

We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice thereâ€™s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasnâ€™t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes â€œoh yeah...â€?

I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to.

My mother agreed - sheâ€™ll be there already, she goes tomorrow because she teaches in the University there - so my dad will be driving my sister and my two aunts (motherâ€™s sister and motherâ€™s aunt).

Aunt 1 (momâ€™s sister) wants to go Saturday - and around 11oâ€™clock, despite my dad also saying that, if they had to go Saturday, he wanted to leave at 9 am at the latest. Mom still didnâ€™t tell Aunt 1 that theyâ€™re actually going Friday night, and since mom travels tomorrow, sheâ€™ll likely not tell and leave the issue to my dad. Aunt 1 is struggling with depression (she was on antidepressives until last year, quit taking them for reasons we donâ€™t know and only now resumed taking them) but sheâ€™s frankly been a nightmare lately.

I want to just tell her the truth already because itâ€™s not fair to my dad, but Iâ€™m afraid that this isnâ€™t my place. \n\nWibta if I didnâ€™t wait for my mother and just told Aunt 1 that they are not going Saturday, much less at 11am?

We both went on to be diagnosed with depression after the incident and some other earth shattering events. But to the story at hand.\n\n\nWe were in one of those big relationship defining fights. Those fights that last for awhile and emotions come out so raw that our immature minds couldnâ€™t properly comprehend all of it. The crux of it was simple. She was contemplating opening up our relationship so she could â€œsow her wild oatsâ€? in college. Iâ€™m as new age as they come but I had a problem with it and wanted to stay a monogamous couple. \n\n\nThe fight progressed and in the end she wanted to take it all back. I couldnâ€™t accept that, I needed to cool off, it felt like my entire world was spinning so I went into the other room to breathe. (Itâ€™s a one room apartment so I couldnâ€™t go anywhere). While in the living room I heard the door to the bathroom slam. I heard her yelling about how she doesnâ€™t want to live. I ran to the bathroom door scared.\n\n\nI heard her frantically searching and slamming through the drawers. I heard a loud crack and a cry. Then it repeated, and repeated.\n\n\nThroughout this time I was saying her name asking her to open the door and to stop. The bang and whimpers continued until I backed up and ran into the bathroom door. The door frame was weak and buckled allowing me in (we had a really cheap apartment, think projects level). When the door swing open I saw her hit her head on the wall again.\n\n\nI immediately grabbed her, wrapped her in a weird bear hug type deal and brought her to the bed in the other room. There she laid next to me and cried for awhile. My head was still spinning but I knew I had to do something. I remembered that 9/11 in our area allowed texting. While she was laying down sobbing I quickly texted 9/11 our location, the situation and to please hurry.\n\n\nMy rational at the time was that she just seriously attempted to hurt herself. As selfish as it sounds I was nowhere near capable of handling the situation alone.\n\n\nThe police came, they talked to us apart. Took us in squad cars to a local hospital where she was admitted to a psych ward after a review. \n\n\nAfter talking to my friends on the matter I was told that I may have handled this wrong. I was informed of the terrible realities of inpatient care. As well as the stress it puts on a person going through a bad times. I feel like shit for hurting her.\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR:\nGirlfriend and I had a big fight over the state of our relationship. She locked herself in the bathroom and hurt herself. I broke in the bathroom and stopped her. Contacted the police and she ended up in inpatient care. \n\n",

I'd much agree if there were two gay Kings, or two gay Queens. Completely okay with it. But I feel like it is not true to call a gay boy \"Queen\" and assign him to a straight King. If the organizers are to select a king and a queen, they should be straight male and female. I think, the organizers are trying so hard to prove that they have an open mind and also to draw attention from the public.\n\nLike, in real life, one does not question a gay couple \"which one of you is the wife/husband?\" Right?

He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?",

My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadnâ€™t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadnâ€™t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that Iâ€™ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks Iâ€™ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his motherâ€™s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like Iâ€™m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way Iâ€™m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole?

For this reason, I think my mom resents me as the reason she was stuck with an abusive man.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my dad would abuse me and my mom would tell me it was my fault for not making a bigger effort to get along with him and obey him. I grew up thinking I was a bad person, because of this and because she was often irrationally cold and angry with me in a way she wasnâ€™t to my siblings. When I was a teenager, I had some major health problems that made it hard for me to take care of myself. My mom was constantly angry and cruel to me during that 3 year period. I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone who raped me, and I couldnâ€™t tell my mom about it because she was more interested in yelling at me for â€œhaving bad judgmentâ€? for dating this person. I moved out after being kicked out of the house temporarily. \n\nAfter I moved my dad turned some of his abuse on my younger brother, who I have always felt my mom favored over my sister and I. He threatened to kick my brother out of the house, so my mom left him. My dad made the divorce very difficult for her, going on a meth bender and losing his job (she had been a stay at home mom for years) so she would have to lose her house and alimony. My mom has understandably been a wreck since.\n\nI recently confronted my mom about the way sheâ€™s always treated me, since she asked if I was angry at her and I felt I owed her the truth. She told me that she felt trapped, that staying with her abuser was hard for her but she did it so we wouldnâ€™t end up homeless, and that she always took his side because he would treat her worse if he thought she was undermining him in front of the kid (me). She said she was cruel to me for years because she was under a lot of stress - her brother committed suicide, her mom for Alzheimerâ€™s and she had to fight her momâ€™s husbandâ€™s family over her care, and she lost her support system (she had previously homeschooled my siblings and I and now she didnâ€™t so didnâ€™t see the same moms). She said her hand was forced to leave my dad because he wanted to kick my brother out of the house, and she wouldâ€™ve done the same if he tried to kick me out (she doesnâ€™t remember that SHE kicked me out because she was on drugs at the time and is in denial). She says she just wants a closer relationship since Iâ€™m mentally ill and sheâ€™s worried about me.\n\nAITA for still being mad at her? I honestly feel she couldâ€™ve done more and is in denial about her real reasons for leaving. She claims to hate my dad but still keeps in contact with him despite him being a meth addict and trying to throw my sister off the side of the highway the last time any of us saw him. Even if she is being honest, I would rather have been homeless than lived with my dad. And this is petty, but Iâ€™m also mad that sheâ€™s sad about her brother. He molested me when I was young. She doesnâ€™t know that but she does know that he was a convicted pedophile and was always alone with me so I canâ€™t imagine she doesnâ€™t suspect it. I still love her but I just donâ€™t forgive her at all.",

If she gets up from a chair the chair will smell just like her and any room she goes in smells absolutely terrible because of her. Every night we have to febreze the store because she stinks up the whole store. I've met her mom and dad before and they both smell perfectly fine.\n\nI brought it up to my manager who said she had already talked to her 3 times previous because herself and other employees had a problem with her smell but she would speak with her again. My manager then spoke with this girl and I felt terrible because she came out of the office crying and left early. The next day she came back and she had no smell whatsoever. My manager said next time someone mentions the smell she will be going to corporate to speak about firing this girl or giving her some type of class on hygiene. Both of which would be embarrassing. Anyway, she smelled perfectly fine but this lasted for a week.\n\nFast forward to today, she smelled so bad that me and some other employees could not even stand to be in the same room as her. A customer came up and told me we need to wash the clothes because they smelled terrible but I know the customer was just smelling the girl she was standing next to. I plan on going and talking to my manager on tomorrow about calling corporate because it's gotten so bad. I feel bad because the girl is very nice but I literally can't even go near her because she smells so bad. I can't even understand how someone can handle smelling that bad.

I just never adjusted my pace when I left.\n\nIn any event, I got assigned as a secondary on a project with a coworker in a different region (we report to different people, but ultimately all within the same overreaching sub-organization) and she was supposed to be the lead on it and we were given 4 months to complete this project. She's been with the organization about 8 years. \n\nBasically the project was 200 items that we had to figure out the status of, get approval to update a couple of pieces of information on, and then submit for an update. So we split the list in half straight down the middle.\n\nThen she immediately went on vacation and then just kind of vanished due to illness for a couple of weeks, leaving me on my own.\n\nSo I went to work on it and I completed my half of the list in a couple of weeks and since she was MIA, I started working on her part of the list too. Once she finally got back, I had gotten through about 70% of the list and we divided it in half again.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, I've completed the half that was given to me and her status update list hasn't really moved, so I've been asking her if there is anything she needs me to do do so she can complete it since I know she is really busy. She always keeps saying no. \n\nI send out reports every week with the link to the status sheet (the bosses requested this link be included) and then quick overview reports of where we are on the grand scheme of the project. I purposely don't put which percentage of who did what on the overview reports because I don't think it's relevant to presenting to a director. However, you can look at the status update sheet and see who completed what.\n\nApparently her boss decided to look at the status update sheet and saw that I had completed something like 80% of the overall list and didn't have any In Progress anymore and her part of the list was still largely set to In Progress and only had a handful of complete items and she got a stern talking to about not taking lead on it.\n\nShe was a little touchy with me this morning because of the talking to she got because apparently I made her look bad to her boss. I apologized and told her that I don't really care who does what part of the project, if she does 5% or 100%. I only care that the project gets completed on time and we are on track to completing our part 3 weeks ahead of the other teams that are working on this in their respective areas. I still don't think she's all that happy with me about it. \n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

He is 8 years older than i am. i am 19 now, he is 27. \n\nmy parents kicked him out for the last time when i was 13 and he was 21, because he wouldnt stop smoking weed, disobeying, and he could not hold a job down even though my parents got him multiple jobs.\n\nhe went to Waco, where my mother who gave us up lives (i was adopted due to drugs and theft at the age of 5, therefore i hate her and have no reason to respect his decision) and he got into some pretty hard drugs. he called me maybe once a month, and i respect that because i know he truly cares for me but cannot get out of the lifestyle he is in. time went on, i turned 18 and moved out of my parents house due to complications, he figured this out and began messaging me over facebook, as he was not allowed to while i was living with my family, because they did not want me to have any connections with my previous scumbag mother other than one call a month under their supervision. anyway, i was ok with him messaging me, but soon the messages stopped, i didnt think much of it, as he doesnt have much money and i assumed he didnt pay his phone bill. i get a text from my mom while at work, and she sent me a picture of his mugshot, and she told me he was in jail for stealing from a disabled woman he was taking care of. \n\nabout a month later i get a message from him, i didnt even read it, i went on a rant and ripped him a new one as best i could through text, calling him all sorts of names, because what kind of person steals from a disabled lady? or anyone for that matter...\n\nanyways... he apologized, said he was with a new girl that he loved very much, had a job, and they shared an apartment. he asked me for 20$ one day because they needed gas money, i had to turn him down because i had just paid a bill and didnt have more than 15$ on my debit.\n\nabout three months later he is saying that he is having trouble with groceries... he asked for money again, this time i was in a good position, had all my bills paid for the month and decided i had about 120$ to spare for my older brother. However... there was NO WAY IN HELL i was just going to transfer a drug addict 120$. mostly because i didnt want him to OD, but another reason is that i wanted my hard earned money to go to a good place...so i made him an order on HEB curbside, picked out all of his groceries, got some toiletries... it was a huge order, mainly because i got all the cheap stuff, but that shouldnt matter. i set the pickup time for the next day, i called the ladies in curbside and told them not to give it to anyone other than him, he got the order, thanked me, and all was good. \n\nfast forward to mid december, he texts me saying he needed 30$ to open an account and unlock his credit card, and he will transfer me 100$ back as a thank you for the groceries. i decided this ONE time i would transfer him money. \n\ni wait two days, and ask him where my part is, or at least my 30$ back because insurance was due...no response.\n\na day later... no response.\n\nfinally he hits me with \"yeah i dont know, i called, they said they would get back with me monday\" \n\ni may be 19, but i am not stupid. the last thing i said to him was \"dont worry about the 30$, even though you probably never were, dont ask me for help ever again\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? he wished me a happy birthday and apologized, i have him a \"thanks\" and refuse to message him back. \n\nwhat kind of man asks his 19 year old sister for financial help, knowing that i am the last one in the family that will even talk to him, then screws me over???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR brother is a loser with an addiction and asks me, his younger sister, for constant help, and eventually screws me over just like the rest of the family.

Now an hour later when my roommate is alone with me she's being passive aggressive and I think this is why?\n\nTldr: am I an asshole for interrupting a conversation I'm not involved in because of a language barrier so I can be involved?",

A coworker (not on my team but same department) kind of pushed me (and yes I'm a pushover) to let him rent from me.\n\nSo yes he's my roommate and my tenant.\n\nHe pays seriously low rent. He pays about 75% of the low end of what he might pay elsewhere (60% of what he'd have to pay if he split an actual apartment). He pays about $100 total for all utilities (cable, internet, water, sewage, electrical, gas) and I pay the actual bills (my portion is easily 3x his).\n\nTo be clear, he **is not a bad guy and he would probably pay if I asked for more.**\n\nIt's just that it's my house and I kinda want to enjoy it by myself. Plus a lot of things he does annoys me. He left the fucking front door open once! I have security cameras and he just makes fun of it and constantly forgets to arm it. He never turns the light off anywhere. The few rules I have for safety purposes he forgets (don't turn on the dryer and leave the house, please for the love of god unplug the god damn toaster oven). He rarely takes the recycling out. After two years of begging he finally takes out the trash but only if he made chicken that day (and he hasn't learned how to put the trash can out for collection). Not maliciously, he's just clueless.\n\nAnd I admit at first I was happy to have him because I figured I could meet more people through him and what not. But nope that isn't happening. \n\nIf he leaves, I would have so much freedom that I constantly day dream about this. Like I could use his room as a game room! I could actually vacuum the whole house (I'm a neat freak... he hasn't washed the bathroom rug in the nearly 3 years he has been here - he also didn't how to use a vacuum cleaner). I could dance around naked the house! I can put up speakers everywhere and play all of my shitty songs! I won't have to check if he closed the front door!\n\nAnyway I've had some of my friends and mutual co-workers call me an asshole because I said I wanted to cancel his lease in the next two months (yes I plan on giving him like 50 day notice). They say I'm a lucky fuck for being able to find a good roommate (because he is) and others struggle finding a good roommate (and I agree - all of my roommates in college were nightmares). They say I'm spoiled for throwing away a source of income. They say I'm an asshole for making him find a another place in a tough market. \n\nI really keep dreaming about enjoying the house alone, but I fear they are right. Am I the asshole?",

Out of all the things that I wouldn't want to do it's probably in the top 10. Anyway,  up until this semester I've probably had to give dozens of presentations in my other classes. With those it wasn't that bad tho because they would typically be group presentations or short 5-7 minute ones.  I could handle them.  This year I had one that was different.  It would be a 10-20 min presentation all by yourself ( and 40% of final grade). Additionally, the presentation could be any format that you wanted as long as you met  the time requirement.  This is where I made my plan. \n\nNow most people did something simple like a PowerPoint and would just read off of it hoping that they were able to reach the 10 minute mark,  not me. I made a trivia game for the class to play. I should also note that every night for homework we are assigned some reading from the textbook to do, most people don't,  I knew this. That chapter in the textbook is where I got most of the questions for the trivia. \n\nNow I had a few reasons for going with trivia.  For one it would have been more interesting for the rest of the class if they could interact with it rather than just sitting there trying to stay awake during a PowerPoint.  It would also work as a review for the final coming up since it is also largely based on the textbook. These were not my primary reasons for doing trivia tho.  I knew trivia would take the professor's attention off of me since I wad presenting and put it on the rest of the class since all the answers were right in the reading that no one did.  It was also so much easier to reach the time limit when the thing that took the longest wad just the silence caused by other people not knowing the answers. Also most presentations end with the rest of the class asking the presenter questions but not mine,  I asked the questions. \n\nWhen I told my roommate about it he said that I was \"the worst kind of person\" which I understand get is a bit facetious but it's still completely possible that I'm an asshole (I will 100% do it again if I can tho). All I did was take a gamble that people didn't read and it worked out. If they had then my presentation would have only been like 5 min and I would have been SOL. \n\nSo am I am asshole for doing this or was I in the right and just used the rules of the assignment to my advantage? Then again,  maybe both are true.",

            "input": "OK so please stay with me this is a very complex situation. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and together for over 8. For a little over 3 years we have lived in NYC which I absolutely hate. It overwhelms me, it is outrageously expensive, and is just hard to live in unless you are one of the mega-rich. We moved to the city to pursue my wife's dream of becoming a professional actor. Initially, the plan was to live here for two years and if she had not accomplished much by that time we would move back home (we are from the southeast). \n\nDuring this time I have worked 4 different jobs and slowly made a decent living for us but it has been brutal. When we first moved I had to take a 100% commission job in sales just to get hired.  Seven days a week work because I had to sell or there was no money. Needless to say we blew through what savings we had pretty quickly, most of which was from selling my car to afford the first couple of months rent. After the sales job I worked for a restaurant start up for a year, then broke in to healthcare management, and now manage a clinic. I have a good employer at this point, and our finances are at long last somewhat stable (been there 8 months). \n\nMy wife has made consistent progress in becoming an actor and trying to join one of the acting unions. She had to start with choir and ensemble roles, but over the time we have spent here she has worked and worked and made it in to principal roles and paid contracts. Now, when I say paid I mean technically they get a check but it is criminal what these theatre companies are able to get away with (we are talking like $200/week). I am extremely proud of her, and I have zero doubts that she isn't always doing her best to make something happen. I love my wife dearly and I know she loves me.\n\nThat said, I have always been the one that has to pay all of our bills. Rent, Internet, Phone, Electric I pay 100% every month and buy most of our groceries. I have very little residual income at the end of each month after bills though fortunately at this point I do have some going in to a 401k. I was already starting to burn out and then a real life change occured....\n\nMy father passed away unexpectedly last spring. We knew he wasn't in great health, but this was a shock. I got the call one morning and he was just gone. I loved my dad, he was a tremendous man who made sure I had good opportunities and was always around for me as I grew up. I was so fortunate to have a father that truly cared. I say that because this was a soul-crushing blow to me and has completely shaken me to my core and I still feel it every day.\n\nBefore his death, I had the resolve from knowing that even though I didn't like living in NYC my wife loves it and that I am being a good spouse for giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream. But now I can't handle it. I have panic attacks all the time, I have been going to a psychologist since November and have had no significant breakthroughs. I feel depressed all the time. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but finding one that takes our insurance has been tough. I have a very hard time completing even basic functions, and I know that my mom and brother are struggling. \n\nI want to move back south asap and get closer to our family. I want to start preparing for my wife and I's life together and  getting to a place where I can deal with this grief. We speak about it all the time and I know she doesn't want to leave NYC. She will but her conditions have been that I have to have a job lined up before we can, and she only really is OK with moving to Atlanta, Georgia (we are not from Georgia) because there is a market for her work there. I am torn because part of me thinks that my health should 100% be a drop everything and lets get you right sort of scenario for her but it doesn't seem to be all of the time. Then I am also torn because I feel I should be stronger and able to handle these things so that she can keep working on what she wants whether it be in NYC or elsewhere. I think my mental stability has about 6 months tops left in the city before I really break.\n\nSo I guess all of that is to ask this question. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?\n\nThank you to anyone kind enough to read through that wall of text.\n\ntl,dr\n\nI relocated to NYC for my wife a little over 3 years ago to support her in her dream of being a professional actor. I hate living there, she loves it. I am the breadwinner and pay 100% of our bills, but she has made progress in establishing her career. My father passed away last spring and now my mental health has gone to s**t with the grief making the anxiety I have from living in the city, on top of the sheer grief itself, even worse. She doesn't want to leave but will concede to relocating to ATL, GA as there is a market there for her work. I just want to get close to home. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?",

He became very belligerent and threatened to call the police claiming I stole some property I had that was the female's (which she gave me and I have text messages telling me to keep it). \n\nFriday evening, I went to Uhaul to get the necessary information on the truck and then to the police to at least see if a phone call from the police would be enough to spur my friends into returning it. While I was at the police station, the female called me and said that she still planned to return the truck that night, but she had been out looking for places to live and will not return to the truck until much later in the evening.  She seemed very upset over the whole thing and I agreed to await further instructions from her about picking it up.  However, I asked for the location of the vehicle and she claimed not to know. It was parked at a friend's house and she didn't know the street name. \n\nThe agreement was for her to call me in an hour when she got back to the vehicle. I texted her when I hadn't heard from her an hour and a half later.  She said then that she would call me in twenty minutes. That was the last I heard from her.  I called her about thirty times and texted several times with no answer all over the next 12 hours.  \n\nFinally, on Saturday morning (today), I gave her a warning that in an hour, if I didn't hear from her, I was going to follow through and go back to the police. \n\nWhen the hour was up, I called and texted her again with no answer.  I went to the police and filed the report.  Then went to Uhaul and gave them the information. I texted her to let her know that if she returned the truck at night after hours, Uhaul would not do anything to her (that's what I was told). However, if she was caught with it, then she/he would be arrested. \n\nI feel really bad and I hate to see anyone get arrested but I grew tired of the lies.   Am I a jerk?",

            "input": "A little background: My girlfriend and I have known each other for two years, we use to work together. We were together for two months before our jobs had her relocate to a foreign country, then we talked and video chatted daily for a month leading up to my visit. I love her so much, we click really well, and we had been talking about engagement leading up to the trip.\n\nAlso, go easy on me, I'm not a great writer.\n\nWell, I got my trip situated to put in for leave for the entire duration of the trip (14 days total) with two days travel time on the front end and three days on the backend. I had all my flights booked, made it there after some pretty long flights, no problems in our relationship at all before getting there. We were so excited to be seeing each other for the first time in months, and it had been about a year since our last romantic encounter. We broke up for about a year after a two-month fling that got a little ugly because she was going through a bad divorce. We talked about it a lot after-words and we ended it because she started to love me, and she wasn't ready for that so soon after her divorce.\n\nWell, I show up and everything is great, better than great actually. The sex is fantastic, we are laughing, eating, having fun. Just a really awesome time only problem at this time is her internet went off because she forgot to pay the bill for a few months. Well we get to the third day of the trip she has an appointment she has to go to and I ask if she wants me to give her some space since we had spent so much time together. I thought it might be healthy to take a breather. Well, she didn't like that too much and she told me \"I'm not wasting my breath asking if you want to come, you can come if you want to but I'm not making you do anything.\" in sort of a negative tone. So I wait a little bit, still not sure if I should go after the aggression but decide to start getting ready. Usually, she takes a bit longer to get ready so I was a little slow on the ball and she leaves after telling me I was too slow and should have gotten ready earlier, fair, but keep in mind it was still about 45 minutes to the appointment, which was right down the road. So I wait until she gets back and I ask if she wants to talk about it, she tells me not really. So I apologize and tell her my point of view on the interaction. She gets very upset at me and tells me to stop starting shit. I was a little taken aback by that and remained quiet and let her get it out of her system, she took this as me pouting. I help her with the bill which is well over $400 at this point, but I know she will pay me back. We spend the rest of the day watching TV, unable to talk because I couldn't start a conversation without it veering south, and not physical affection from her at all.\n\nDay four is like this as well, we had times in the past where sometimes she just needs a little time, so I give it to her and lay on the opposite side of the bed, she did not want to be touched. We laid in bed the whole day, then went out to dinner with some of her friends.\n\nDay five starts off the same, no cuddling or anything in bed which is different because in the past we had always cuddled to sleep, but she said it was too hot so I didn't argue. When we are waking up she grabs my hand and kisses it, honestly at this point I'm just internally begging for any kind of affection so it was very heartwarming. She had to go get a birth control implant that day, and those things hurt for days. We went on a trip to a lake with one of her friends this day, started off the same after she was fully awake as the previous two days, mostly ignored again or a negative attitude. The drive to the lake is about an hour and 45 minutes, she didn't address me once the entire drive and only talked to her friend. Her friend, however, was very nice and talked with me about some mutual interests. We get to the lake and she is actively trying to avoid talking to me still, went to some shops near it and she wouldn't talk to me, or respond to any of my comments about some trinkets. We start the drive back and we make a snack stop because he friend had to take a number two, I say I'm going in and ask if she wants anything. She turns to her friend in the back seat and asks him to get her a drink. After her friend leaves, I ask her what's going on and why thing have been weird\" the past few days. Her reply is nothing was wrong and that she wants space, then she tells me I'm the one whos starting \"shit out of nothing\" because she \"asked her friend instead of me to get her a drink\". I quickly drop the subject hoping that it really was like that. We get back to her place that night and things actually seem a bit better, we end of having sex that night not great because of her arm but I'm just glad we are back to being affectionate.\n\nDay six I wake up feeling pretty good, although we couldn't cuddle or anything during the night because I didn't want to risk her arm being hurt. She has a quick appointment to take a short class, then she is back. She kissed me when she got back. after that, it seemed like the previous night didn't change anything and we are back to how it was before distance and negativity. We spend the rest of the day inside watching TV, eat Popeyes for dinner. Silence for nearly the entire day between negative comments anytime I try to start a conversation. Day seven Then it was back to more of the same, we go out to eat at a KBBQ style place and its dead silence nearly the entire time, aside from passing food back and forth and making sure each other have enough to eat. I try to ask why things are so weird between us again and I get shut down instantly, again. Apparently its fine and she just doesn't feel like talking. No affection at all this day.\n\nDay eight at this point I'm really at my wit's end, I can't deal with this silence much longer and I'm just counting down the clock to leave the next morning. We eat Popeyes for dinner and stay inside all day again, going to the superstore to pick up some necessities for a little bit, but it's obvious she didn't want my presence. I didn't bother to bring up the subject and I was just looking to get on my flight the next day. Day nine My flight got delayed a day. We went back to her place for two hours and got in an argument because I made a joke about something we were watching. After that, I went and got a hotel room. Day ten I boarded my flight, we didn't talk at all this day aside from organizing her to get me to the airport, maybe 10-minute drive for her in total. I said my goodbyes and she was silent. Later on, she texts me telling her when I land at each stop and acting as if she cared. It felt nice.\n\nDay eleven I'm at a layover at my next stop, total time is about a day. I have a lot of time to think so I confront her about how the trip was for me and my point of view on the whole thing. She was very quick to make excuses to a comment I made about how I felt like I \"wasn't able to talk and I was more or less silenced\" telling me that \"just because things didn't go the way YOU expected does not mean YOU know exactly how I feel\", telling me that I \"wasn't being ignored\" and that I was making her a \"villain\". She told me that I \"kept pushing her\" to talk about what was wrong, and that's why she was refusing to say what was bothering her. After that, I kind of just told her that I was done pursuing the relationship, explained why the trip was very hurtful to me and try to explain it to the best of my ability from my point of view. Which is basically that I have no idea aside from that first argument why everything went so downhill so fast, and that I felt like the distance between us was greater when I was there than when I wasn't. Basically just pouring my heart out about how I wanted a little more attention. Well, she tells me that \"just because things didn't go your way, you're making me the villain.\" and that she's upset that I pushed her way too much to talk while I was there.\n\nThis is already really long, I wish I could show all of you what happened more accurately. \n\nTLDR: Visited girlfriend 7000 miles away, got in a small argument after being there for three days. Isolated and ignored for the most part for the rest of trip afterward, told I'm the one making the problem.\n\nI'm at a loss Reddit, Am I The Asshole for wanting a little more attention and verbal/physical affirmation in our relationship after traveling all that way?",

One of them, who we'll call Walter, is my uncle and he's an alcoholic who frequently verbally abuses his wife in front of his 4 kids. So yeah, total idiot, and I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to spend as little time as possible interacting with him in any way.\n\nSo now that that's out of the way, onto the story.\n\nToday is my 20th birthday, and so my grandfather wanted to go on a trip to celebrate it. I was naturally really excited to go, and he never said anything that would imply that it would be anyone but just me, my brother, and two of our younger siblings. I also never had any reason to believe that it would be anyone but us, because he rented out a 3 bedroom house for us to stay in over the duration.\n\nBut as soon as we got there, there was already another car parked in the driveway, which was Walter's family car. I was a little annoyed, but I was assuming that they would be renting the house next to ours since we would definitely not have enough room in the one we're currently renting. But no, they actually are staying in the three bedroom house that we're renting.\n\nFor perspective, I had assumed that there would be 5 people staying with us; me, my brother, two younger siblings, and my grandfather, which would fit the 3 bedrooms quite nicely, since two bedrooms had twin beds in them, for a total of 5 beds. Now there's fucking 10 people in this house in total. When I asked my grandfather why he thought it would be a good idea to invite a whole entire other part of the family to come stay with us in a 3 bedroom house for 4 days, all he said was \"I'm sorry you're disappointed.\"\n\nSo now me and my brother are considering just buying an uber and hitching a 4 hour ride back home, for several reasons:\n\n1. I don't feel like dealing with screaming children for 4 days straight. I don't dislike kids, I just hate to listen to them when they're loud and their parents have no control over them whatsoever, and they have 3 toddlers, with no control over them whatsoever.\n\n2. I'm honestly kind of pissed that he would invite them when he knows for a fact that I don't like them, especially on something like a trip for my birthday that we've been planning for over a month now. And he didn't even tell me they were coming.\n\n3. It's fucking cramped. We're having to cram 10 people into 3 bedrooms. It just doesn't work.\n\nSo, the reason I'm making this post is because I definitely would feel bad about just walking out on a trip that my grandfather wanted to give me for my birthday, but I definitely don't feel bad about walking out when I'm sharing a house with a toxic couple and their obnoxious children.

(one month after signing a year long lease) I was very happy for her and her boyfriend however she quickly cut me off even though we still lived together. Two months later she tells me she is moving in two weeks and needs to be off our lease to sign her new one. She said she would pay her half of the rent for the remainder of our lease or until I found a new roommate because her boyfriend got rent paid for through military. I let her off the lease with that in mind. We're both full time students and part time employeed in small college town so naturally it's been rough to find a roommate (especially because my she moved out middle of October) after paying two months of her half of the rent she sends me a message completely unprompted to say that I'm a shitty friend for not having found a roommate yet. [Side note: she told me she was leaving on a specific day which she lied about becauseÂ  I came home from work one day and she was just gone. She never said anything to me about it] and that she wasn't gonna give me anymore money for the rent because I've been given ample time to find one. I've now been put into a financial crisis because no one can move in due to their own leases not being up and I cannot handle the entire rent myself. Had to borrow money from my boyfriend which makes me feel shitty. So I sent her a message recently - even though we haven't talked since her message to me - and told her she wasn't a decent enough person to even think twice of the burden she put on me as well.

When I said sorry he responded passive-aggresively saying that I betrayed him and that I didn't care or respected his feelings. I apologized and sent him memes, asked him things on a daily basis and he responded very shortly with \"haha\",\"ok\", seeming very sick of me.

They have been guilt tripping me since then, constantly bringing it up, saying how it's better for my younger brother to have me Christmas morning (which i acknowledge as a good idea and may be the case in the next few years) and saying how Christmas isn't going to be good this year.\n\nYesterday my mother text my father saying that she wanted the switch days and I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with him explaining that it wasn't my idea to switch and that I didn't want to, because he was slightly put out because he thought i didn't want to spend it with them.\n\nI feel guilty that Im \"ruining\" my mam and sisters plans but I don't think I should be forced to change my pre-arranged plans to accommodate their last minute change.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

After I've been social in a large group (a.i. Christmas) I need about a day where I'm pretty much alone to rewind. I know this is atypical and I should probably have seen a psychiatrist at an early age, but I never did. This is rarely an issue now as I've learned my limits but things often go wrong when you involve my mom and her side of the family. I'm 18 now and I live with my parents. I see my grandparents pretty often but not my cousin.\n\nSo it was the day after Christmas, me, my mom and my brother were at my grandparent's house with my cousin and as the day progressed I became more and more tired as usual. I got about an hour alone while the rest were on a walk, but I still felt the rudeness show up, so when it came time to discussing whether we would stay for dinner I said I wanted to go home. Mom clearly heard me yet confidently said we would stay. I repeated myself this time expressing how tired I was, but she persisted. \n\nSo I said something like \"fine, then I'll take the bus. Goodbye\" and walked to the front door. Mom chased me and told me something like \"You are going to stay! Think of grandma, grandpa and your cousin.\" to which I replied, somewhat angrily: \"I said goodbye. I can go home when I want and I'm really tired right now. You know how that ends.\" She kept saying that this was going to ruin Christmas as I rushed out the door to the bus stop and the silence of the outside made me think more rationally. I didn't even get of the lawn before I realised that I had the car key so I went back inside to leave it there. \n\nNow my family were going home after all and my mom had railed everybody in the house. I told my mom that they should stay if they want to and I'll go home but for some reason that wasn't an option.\n\nFrom my mom's perspective I know she wants everyone to be together ~~and happy~~ as much as possible and stuff like this makes her really upset. She feels it's my duty to be well mannered and consequently social until she decides it's time to go home. She can't understand why an hour of rest shouldn't be enough to cover a day of socialising. \n\nFrom my perspective she does this so often. With this I mean try to guilt trip me into situations I'm not comfortable being. It's always \"Think of ... and ...! They'll be so sad and it will ruin our entire day!\" in even though the other people have said that I don't have to stay/go if I don't want to. Especially my cousin has stressed that he thinks this is shitty behaviour when we two talk and respectfully taken my side in front of my mom, but nothing has changed.",

I suspect some of you may know of this restaurant, in which case you realize how difficult it is to get a table.\n\nWhen we are finally sat down my goal was to treat her to a meal, and then proceed with the breakup after the fact.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's still pretty damn long, so apologies in advance. \n\nI'm a sophomore in college and my birthday was late in January. Towards the beginning of the month during break I had asked my mom if they would be able to come down to campus around my birthday and do something with me and my friends. I wasn't sure if financially they could, as a couple things had happened that made money more of a concern than usual. She told me not to worry about that and to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nOver the next few weeks I had a lot to do - with classes starting, research, my grading job, and trying to find time for my friends and a little for myself I was pretty busy. Because of this I kept forgetting to figure out what I wanted to do when they came. My mom continued asking every few days or so, but I kept forgetting (this is a common problem with me and it's really frustrating, it leads to issues for me sometimes). I should also note that I'll miss calls or texts from them a decent amount because I'm not around my phone often, but at home I'm more attentive to it because I have much more free time. This frustrates my parents, especially my mom, as they think I don't pay attention to them. Anyway, it got a to few days before the weekend before my birthday, and my parents told me they couldn't make it that morning and would come next weekend.\n\nI decided that week that I wanted to either go bowling or play mini golf, depending on what worked best for everyone. I told my mom, and she said I needed to figure out which for sure, what time, who was coming, if anyone needed a ride, etc. I'd say this was about Monday, maybe? I was busy throughout the week and didn't have much time to talk to people, alongside the fact that I would constantly forget only to remember later and feel anxious about it.\n\nThis all finally came to a head last night, where my mom snapped. Something important is that she has some anger issues. She would never hurt me or anything, but she gets extremely angry and screams. Well, that's what happened. I was with my girlfriend in bed late at night and had forgotten my phone in a different room. I remembered it and went to grab it. Then I saw my mom had texted me several times and tried to call me 10 times in the span of two minutes. I should also note that using Tasker I had it set up on my phone so that if I shook my phone, it would mute all sound and automatically reject calls. I had left it on before I left my phone, so no sound was being played and all calls were being rejected.\n\nSo I shit myself out of terror and called her immediately. She then yelled at me for 7 minutes about how I didn't care about her or my dad and that I was being disrespectful for not getting back to her sooner. There was more she said, but I've forgotten most due to a bit of overload and just generally being forgetful. She concluded by asking why if I don't care, she should care and said something else after that. I couldn't hear the last part because I was exhausted, so I asked what she said and apologized saying that I was tired and missed it. Then she said \"You know what? I'm done. BYE!\" and hung up on me. My girlfriend and I talked about it, and I turned my volume on anticipating that I would get a call back. About 20 minutes later I did.\n\nI can't remember much of that call, just that it was upsetting. At one point I know she said if I disrespected her like that again she would keep my truck (which is being repaired - they're paying for the repairs if that matters), break my phone, bring me home every weekend, and at some other point she said she'd break my fingers (dont remember how that came up? It was still while saying basically that I had better never do that again. I should also clarify that my mom has never hurt me and I know she wont, even if she threatens to sometimes when she gets really angry). Those were the most intense things, but the rest of the call was also pretty bad. Sorry I can't give more of it.\n\nEarlier today my Dad called to figure out what I had wanted to do. I told him what I had planned and we put together the last parts (ended up being bowling if anyone cares). He was also angry about how I had waited until the last minute and yelled at me a bit too, though it wasn't nearly as bad as with my mom. He basically was telling me how frustrating it was to not be able to contact me when they need me, and that it seems like I don't care about them. He did say they wanted to do this for me and see me but it seemed like I didn't care at all. In addition he said I was stressing my mom out because they didn't know what was going on yet, that my mom was already feeling sick and that was making it worse, and that they spent an hour last night talking about me and this whole thing when they could've been sleeping. My mom was there too and said something along the lines of how I only want their money and don't give a damn about them. After a bit of that we hung up, and that's where I am now.\n\nSo, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I really should've figured things out earlier. I meant to, I just was busy and kept forgetting, though my parents say that's not an excuse. I can be pretty bad about getting back to them sometimes. Usually I'll respond within a day, but once in a while I'll miss it for longer. I can see how that would be frustrating. But on the other hand, I feel like they, especially my mom, went way overboard and that it wasnt nearly bad enough to justify that kind of response. This sort of thing happens somewhat often and I usually feel conflicted about it. I've wanted to post before, but never did until now. So, AITA?",

Heâ€™s expressed that big social gatherings bother him and that dances/parties especially arenâ€™t his scene.\n\nWeâ€™re in highschool and there are homecoming dances. Iâ€™d gone the previous year with friends, before Iâ€™d met my boyfriend, and decided to go this year as well. Two weeks before the dance, Iâ€™d texted my boyfriend, asking if heâ€™s gone to past dances since heâ€™s in a higher grade. He tells me no and asks why I asked, and I tell him itâ€™s because I wanted to know if Iâ€™d be going with friends or him as a date in advance. He was unsure and the convo stopped there. \n\nFlash forward two weeks, the day of the dance. Iâ€™m getting ready and receive a text from him. He asks if Iâ€™m attending the dance and I say yes. I get a very typical â€œoh, nevermind,â€? response. I press a little and he ends up flipping the fuck out. He immediately asks why I hadnâ€™t asked him to be his date, and why he was finding out last minute I was going. I told him Iâ€™d mentioned it two weeks prior and didnâ€™t bring it up again because I didnâ€™t want to pester him. Iâ€™m terrified of bothering somebody so close to me. My anxiety makes me 100x more bothered by rejection, especially from my own partner. He tells me â€œIâ€™m at a tournament stressing about this because you didnâ€™t want to use your big girl words.â€? (Heâ€™s an extremely dedicated wrestler. Tournaments are every weekend and itâ€™d take something super important for him to miss one.) \n\nBy now Iâ€™ve left home. I ended up repeatedly apologizing for not making my desire for him to be my date clear and spent most of my dance time worriedly checking my phone notifications. I asked how I could prevent this from happening in the future, to which he gave a condescending â€œSpeak up. That is quite literally what needed to happen. A concept instilled in four year olds because theyâ€™ll hurt themselves and not say anything.â€? That combined with the big girl comment left me extremely hurt but I gave up trying to defend myself because every reason seemed like bullshit to him. \n\nHalfway through the dance, he asks where I am. Somehow heâ€™d gotten entry. We sat down and talked more, and he was noticeably calmer. A few off topic things were mentioned and Iâ€™d asked why he even approached me when we first met, and he claimed it was a friendâ€™s dare. This killed my self esteem, which he knows I already struggle with heavily. I told him that later that night and he admitted he lied about it being a dare make somebody feel worse than he was (because heâ€™d lost the tournament? Which anybody would be upset by.)\n\nBasically, AITA for not formally asking him straight up to go to the dance with me? Or was it blown out of proportion? My friends think his reaction was completely uncalled for and that his words were beyond hurtful, but I feel as though none of this wouldâ€™ve happened if I just had the balls to be direct. ",

Before I worked here, there was another supervisor that worked in my place. A few years ago she lost her mother. She had to go back to Hungary for the funeral. A bunch of clients and residents had donated money but a few co-workers had also lent her some money too (about $1000). They gave it to her with the understanding that she would pay it back. Well months passed and she ended up leaving for a better job opportunity. Since then she's been avoiding calls from the people I work with and has only given them a fraction of what was loaned to her.\n\nNow come to the present time. A co-worker approached me yesterday and told me that his 92 year old grandmother has passed away. He explained that he would like to attend the funeral and be with family in his homeland, India. He was very sad about this. I had consoled to the extent of professionalism but that was all. I do feel bad for anyone who has lost a loved one, but she was 92. I can only feel sadness for someone briefly if they lived a long healthy life. I think if anything, that calls for a celebration.\n\nAnyways, so this guy is telling about the prices to go to India and how outrageous it is. I totally understand the stress of it all but then he asks me for a loan. He wanted about $500 to help him out. I immediately say no. I wasn't rude about it but I made it clear that I don't do that. I don't mind lending money to family and friends who I trust. A co-worker is a completely different story though. I just don't trust him. He may try to pull what the other supervisor did. All of it just seemed fishy. I wasn't interested in getting wrapped up in financial drama. Not to mention, it's two days after Christmas which is always a difficult time for most.\n\nHe was very upset with me for not even considering it. Because I'm the supervisor, I guess they think I make a lot more than them. But it's really not the case. I'm struggling like the rest of the working class.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think anyone should get mad at someone for not lending them money. You have the right to ask someone what ever you want. I just don't think you should expect things from people even during a trying time.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all of your comments. Turns out the guy wasn't even going to India. He asked a few other people and now there is a full blown investigation. I'm not sure if this is grounds for dismissal but at least he learned something from it. Hopefully.",

            "input": "Hey guys,\n\nI'll explain this as succinctly as possible. 5 months ago, my mom invited the son of an old friend of hers to move in to our house. We (my sister and I) don't know the family well, so we thought it was odd. \n\nAs the days went on, we started to learn more about him. He's a sweet kid, but he definitely has his flaws. For one, he's a 17 year old high school dropout. Not great, but it happens (this is how I rationalized it to myself). He also smokes a ton of pot. While it isn't that big of a deal, we haven't been happy with the stench. His room is putrid. It smells like a mix between rotten food and pot. My mother seems to have no issue with any of this for whatever reason. \n\nAll of that doesn't seem \\*that\\* bad, right? I didn't think so either until my younger sister recently filled me in on some of the underpinnings of his life. She has the room adjacent to his. The wall that separates the room is extremely thin, so she hears everything. Here's what she told me: \"I can hear EVERYTHING, Dreadcarrier. The drop of a pin, a whisper. So guess what I get to hear when he has his boyfriend over 3-4 nights a week? A lot of fighting, crying, and sex.\" She's a college student (as am I) so this really disrupts her sleep/work schedule. Once again, my mother brushes this off. She thinks she's doing something nice for the kid and that takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, there's more! My little sister follows him on Instagram. He has been posting pictures of himself \"tripping\" on my back porch! Not to mention the fact that he took a picture of himself using my sister's expensive Yeti cup as a gravity bong. All of this has her truly irked, and my mom thought she was overreacting (to the cup thing, not sure if she knows about the psychedelics). \n\nAnyway, I've been skeptical of this arrangement from the get-go. I never thought it was a good idea to remove a problem child from his (accepting of his sexuality but strict about his lack of achievement) family. Once I saw it was giving him the freedom to do drugs and continue to let himself fall into a hole, my suspicions were confirmed. I haven't voiced my concerns because it isn't my house or my business, but now it is affecting my sister's life. \n\nI plan on confronting my mother. I want to explain that what she is doing may seem like a good deed, but it isn't helping the kid in the long-term. He has no life structure, no authority making sure he is doing right. He also has no intention of going back to school and smokes pot all the time. Giving him carte blanche isn't what's best for him. I also plan on explaining that his presence is disrupting her successful child's life. It isn't fair to give her the short end of the stick because she works hard. She deserves to live in a quiet house where she feels comfortable. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I want to get back together with her and\n\nMy ex and I dated for about 4 years prior to us breaking up about 9 months ago.  I initiated the break up due to emotional issues stemming from my father's death in August 2017 (I was having a lot of difficulty processing and expressing emotions healthily and she is already a very emotional person and I kept asking myself \"How am I supposed to take care of your emotional needs when i can't even take care of my own?\"  I've since learned that letting people in is not weakness, as well as made progress towards getting past being constantly affected by the loss of the greatest man I've ever known).  At the time, she had said she would like to remain friends and we actually made earnest and sincere efforts to be friends; hanging out at neutral and public locations, paying for ourselves if food/drink/entertainment became involved, etc.  A few weeks ago, it came to a point where we realized the feelings were still there, mutually, but that we would need to talk more about how it was going to work between us (it used to be very one-sided in my direction and I want to put the balance more towards the middle) if we were to get back together.  So we began talking about getting back together and we still are.\n\nDuring all this time, she started hanging out another guy.  I was fine with this because we were broken up at the time and he seemed like a good friend to her.  Until a lot of things happened to make me feel the opposite.  Without going too deep into it and making this a stupidly long post, he has an abusive streak that he's using to control her.  In recent months, he's had her cosign for a brand new motorcycle and rejected getting a used car, isolated her from most of her friends, and move in with him into an apartment that she can barely afford half the rent on (and he can't pass a tenant screening so she's on the hook for that, too).  If she were to take on the amount of time necessary for her to afford more plus bills, she would have to quit school.  Everytime I come to her place, I'm told by her to just not engage (I do not like this \"man\" and refuse to do him the courtesy of hiding it from my face).  When I leave, he gets in her face and tries to intimidate her accusing her of bringing me over to have sex (the woman was on the floor shaking in obvious medical distress and he said, \"You're a needy little cunt, aren't you?\" and left.  I was there to help take care of her.).\n\nI have told her that she needs to get out of there, I have pointed out all the red flags, and she has been told how all of those were also things done to her by her mother (very abusive childhood).  I have also said that I can't control what she does with her life or who she hangs out with when we date again, but I have told her that if we moved in together, he will not be welcome in my home and I refuse to make him feel welcome in my home (still debating whether I'm even going to *let* him feel welcome in my home.  I am aware that it would be her home, too.).  She is still intent on being friends with him.  I haven't dropped the \"It's either him or me,\" line and I'm afraid of it coming to that because I'm not sure I would win but more importantly, it would put a huge strain on our relationship and I'm not sure we would outlast it before she realized that getting away from him was a good thing.  Am I the asshole for wanting her to get this guy out of her life before her and I get back together and try to find a place to live?\n\n\n\n\n",

We spent some time apart and I realized that I still wanted him in my life. Long story short, we got back together. Throughout the relationship, he was very rude, uncaring, and inconsiderate towards me. I would always let him walk all over me because I knew he was in a tight spot with his family at the time but it still hurt whenever he would insult me or do other generally not so great things. I finally decided that it was time to end the relationship because I just did not love him like I had used to, and I explained that to him as best as I could. For the weeks after, he threatened suicide, self harm, and other terrible things. He had been one of my best friends as well as a boyfriend, so I would try to be there for him. Due to what he calls â€œhis bad state of mindâ€? he treated me even worse to the point where Iâ€™d stay up crying thinking it was my fault for putting him in this terrible situation. That went on up until a mutual friend of ours told me that he had been trying to make me feel jealous, upset, etc. to try and win me back, so I decided then and there to just cut things off. I see him later in the week with a gash going up his wrist, and decide that he needs me there for him. About another week went by until he started flaunting this new girl he was talking to, talking about how she was better than me. It really stung, and to be honest I lost my cool. I was not nor was I previously ever in the right state of mind to be helping another person with their major mental problems, but i knew he needed a friend (if thatâ€™s what you can call friendship) this past week everything blew up. We got into a big argument where he accused me of manipulating him and becoming selfish and bitchy. I finally decided it was time to cut him off FOR REAL. Two days later Iâ€™m hearing from our mutual friends heâ€™s trying to kill himself again. Am I the asshole for not being able to put up with his shit when he really needed me? ",

I've never been a maid of honor before though. I'm struggling with this situation so far:\n\nSo Becky has already picked out her dress and decided on bridesmaid dresses. We spent an entire day shopping in a city an hour away and deciding on these things. \n\nSince then, she has invited the other bridesmaids and I to go to 2 events with her. The first was a florist visit last month so she could decide on the kind of flowers she wanted for the wedding. I originally said yes I would go, but then she had to change the date of the appointment to a day where I had to work. So I didnt go. \n\nThe second event was yesterday. 3 days prior she had told me and other bridesmaids about this bridal fair she wanted to go to, and asked if we could go. I told her I would have to see how things went because I worked that evening. The event would basically take most of my sleeping time. But whatever. \n\nSaturday night comes along and Becky and I both get invited out to a birthday party of a mutual friend that night. We both had off, and we would see some good friends which included the other bridesmaids, so we all went. Everyone got wasted, most people not making it home before vomiting. I had a good time, things felt good. At the party, Becky asked me again if I would go to the bridal fair the next morning. She begged, saying only a couple of other older family members were going with her. Drunk me felt like Superwoman, so I said sure. Everyone got drunk af and went home. \n\nI went home at 2am, woke up at 5am with a splitting headache and a shit ton of stomach pain. I took ibuprofen and tried to get comfortable enough to sleep. No go. I chugged water. Still felt like shit. Now its 8am and I am extremely nauseous. I hadn't drank alcohol since 1am, I thought I had escaped nausea. My boyfriend was really worried I had something else going on because of the amount of pain I was in, and wanted me to go to the hospital, but I'm in the medical field so I felt like I knew when I would need to go to the doctor. I couldnt sleep still. It was 9:30am. The bridal fair was supposed to be at 11. I texted Becky to tell her I wasnt going to be able to go. I felt like complete crap. I apologized. \n\nI finally vomited, passed gas, and the stomach pains/nausea started to fade. It was 11:30. Becky had opened my message but not responded. I finally was able to fall asleep. At 1pm I woke up to a message from Becky, saying she was extremely disappointed in the fact that I wasnt there for her with the wedding planning. She said I never went to events with her and she would just have to learn to \"lean on\" someone else instead of me. \n\nI'm like...what? I spent a day with her picking out dresses. I am actively planning an expensive bachelorette party because she wants a destination one. I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. It has just been shitty timing for the other stuff. I told Becky this, she said it doesnt change the fact that I've let her down and been a disappointment to her. She then went on to say she doesnt accept my reasons for not going to the bridal fair (extreme nausea and pain). She said every other bridesmaid had messaged her the same thing and she expected more. \n\nI just... I don't know. In my family, you did not have the maid of honor or bridesmaids do shit like this. They help with bachelorette parties and stuff like that. It's just weird to me that Becky seems to expect this much of me and the other bridesmaids. Is this normal though? Am I being an asshole? \n\nTl;dr bride is mad that maid of honor and bridesmaids cant make it to florist meeting and bridal fair. AITA for not being there?",

I pieced this together from my friends and parts of my own memory.\n\nSo last weekend I was at a small party (6 people) at my friend's house who I will call Dylan. We are a group of 5 friends but this time Dylan invited a girl he recently met, I'll call her Emma. We had a bunch of different substances and planned on playing some (board) games and just having a good time.\n\nAround 9 PM I took a bar of Xanax after smoking a bit. I must say I do have a little tolerance to benzos so this didn't really knock me out or anything. Dylan decided to stick to alcohol this night and Emma took 2C-B for the first time. The others were smoking weed and drinking, my other friend (Brian) took a bar of Xanax too. \n\nWe were all having a great time. Emma was having the time of her life and could not believe what she was experiencing, meanwhile Dylan was already getting pretty drunk. Around 11 PM we started playing a drinking game. I had my mind set on taking it easy since I have blacked out in the past combining benzos and alcohol. Emma came to sit next to me and kept touching me and resting her head on my shoulder. I did not know how to respond to this and just let her do her thing. I know how intense and stimulating a trip can be and did not want to mess up the moment.\n\nThe drinking game went pretty OK. I stopped after 3 shots because I already felt that I was entering dangerous territory. Dylan on the other hand was getting absolutely hammered. Emma was playing it safe too and stopped after 2 shots. While this was going on she was still very touchy and affectionate towards me. Honestly I just didn't really know what to do. I've never gone beyond first base with a girl and felt conflicted. My friends noticed this and distracted her for some time.\n\nSomewhere between 11 and 12 PM I took another bar of Xanax. I know, it's stupid but I couldn't help it. I remember feeling pretty slumped and went to lay down on a bed in a different room. I slept for an unknown amount of time (0-2h) and woke up with Emma standing next to me. At this point I was still pretty barred out and she was talking to me. I didn't really care for whatever what she was saying and just closed my eyes again. This is where it all falls down.\n\nI think around an hour passed when Emma came to lie down next to me, and I asked her what she was doing. She told me she was just tired from the trip and wanted to relax a little, I believe she was close to the end of the peak. I think I was sobering up a little bit (could have taken another bar, not sure) and put on some relaxing music and tried to sleep again. At this point Emma was again getting very touchy and I just ignored and tried to go to sleep. I remember taking off my boxers and that's about it. I woke up around 10 AM with both of us naked and I left shortly after.\n\nI have no exact memory of what happened and tried my best to piece the shards I know together. After this I called Dylan and asked him if he knew what happened the other night and how he was doing. He told me he knows absolutely nothing but had a good time regardless. I don't know what to tell him, I feel like this would put an end to our friendship. I have seen Emma once since this all went down and she kept going with the same touchiness and attention. I don't know what to make of this but I feel like I gigantic dick and asshole. \n\nTLDR: Had sex (?) with my friend's fling while she was tripping and I was partially blacked out. He doesn't know and she acts like nothing happened but still gives me lots of attention.",

Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment.

But called me the asshole for bringing an 'aggressive dog' to the park. \n\nMy main defense and why I think the dude is WAY out of line is one humping is not JUST a play behavior. It's about dogs asserting dominance over one another. And when your dog is trying to hump mine to that extent, you need to better train your dog before he does that to a way more aggressive dog than mine. And two, my dog may be the one getting angry and loud, but your untrained dog is provoking this. Or what am I supposed to do? AITA?",

The only time she might actually clean the house is if we have company over, but since we live out in the sticks that's maybe a couple times a year.\n\nNow, I'm by no means Howard Hughes-levels of neat freak, but I do like to keep things at least reasonably tidy and organized. I tend to work less hours (although right now I'm working on-call and a SAHD) so I'm ok with doing the majority of the general housework, but it still bothers me that I'm constantly picking up after her.\n\nCase in point: a couple days ago I did a deep clean of the kitchen; washed all the dishes and scrubbed down the stove and counter tops. After she got home from work she made dinner (which was mostly leftovers anyways) and then had an impulse to do some baking. Now, I'm a proponent of the \"if you cook, they clean\" rule, but within reason. By the end of the night there was a full load of dishes and the surfaces were worse than they were before I cleaned them.\n\nMaybe this will come across as crazy, but the little stuff sometimes bothers me more than the big things. This morning she left some crumbs on the counter (that I had just re-cleaned yesterday after the previous mess) from making breakfast. Now, it only took me a few seconds to sweep the crumbs off the counter and throw them away, but it bothers me that she couldn't be bothered to take the few seconds to do it herself. Or the damn pull tabs from the milk cartons that just sit on the counter top for days until I finally take the few seconds required to throw it away.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the endless battlefield that is the kitchen table. She insists on using the table as her home office, because her actual home office is too cluttered to be used as such. In several homes we have been in, she has used the table as a dumping ground for her stuff, even though in one home she would have to walk past her office room and open a baby gate to get to the table, and in another walk down 14' of stairs and yet again open a baby gate. I just don't understand how someone can exert MORE effort to make a mess than to not.\n\nNow if I'm not already, this might be the point that I officially become the asshole. Her mom is a hoarder. Not to the point that you'd see on the TLC show, but still pretty bad. I'm starting to realize that my wife might not know what \"cleaning up after yourself\" even means. Granted, I spent most of my formative years in a similar environment (more dilapidation than hoarding) and I think it my stress is related to that, but it my be comforting for her in a way.",

She's in a serious relationship and has been for a while, so since a friend of ours got married over the weekend she's had weddings on the mind. I teased her about basically planning her whole wedding since then and she told me she'd planned nearly everything, except who her maid of honor would be. She basically told me that I would only be hers if I promised that she'd be mine. For some background, she's not close to any of her family and has no close siblings. I'm her closest friend, so when the time comes then I'd assumed she'd pick me, because there really isn't anyone else who would make sense. In contrast, I come from a very large family, and despite many brothers, I only have one sister, who I'm pretty close to. I told my friend many years ago, probably around 8th grade, that I'd like my sister to be my maid of honor when I get married because she's my only sister, and that made sense to me. She knows this, she was offended at the time, but she knows it's important to me. The last time we talked about it I basically just said that there's no way that I'd be able to plan anything about my wedding now, and that we can worry about it later on. After she made that condition today I just made a joke about how she'd be waiting a long time to tie the knot if she had to wait for me to do it first, and then after I didn't promise her that she stopped texting me back at all. She'll get over it (I'm not scared she won't talk to me or anything), but is it unreasonable for me to expect to be her maid of honor if I can't promise she'd be mine, or is it unreasonable that she's making a fight over something that probably won't be an issue for at least a decade?

The only thing that really matters in consequence, if your actions will give you a negative or positive result.\n\nTheres no point in being guilty or sad due to past actions as it doesnt really matter.

Part of my reasoning was to help them financially, part of this was to help myself get on my feet in a new state. I feel though as my sister has always looked at me as a neanderthal. When she visited my apartment for the first time (2 years before I moved in with them) the first thing she did (after hugging me and saying Hi) was went straight to the cupboards and said \"Oh my god, you have real food!!\". I was 30 years old for fucks sake. What did she think I ate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince moving in, she has made increasingly hurtful remarks and while I believe she may not be aware of what she is saying, I am tired of it. She is an emotional wreck so she breaks at even a hint of ill feelings. Once I disagreed with something and she broke down crying because I thought she was a horrible mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough..... I wouldnt say she is a horrible mother, there's a lot she isnt doing right, in my opinion. Her kids (now 11 and 13) are lazy and out of control. They dont clean up after them selves (because mom will do it). They go apeshit if we kick them off the xBox that they have been playing all day. I had to buy a router that I could set time limits that would shut off the internet at 10pm otherwise they would be up until midnight even if they had school the next day. The first night it took effect, the oldest lost his shit, got his cell phone and resumed watching videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't reprimand the kids because, as my sister told me, \"They are MY kids and I will take care of it.\" The brother in law just kind of looks the other way unless something serious happens. He will step in when a MAJOR attitude correction needs to take place (like when the oldest punched a girl in school).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am done with feeling like less of a person just to help them out. I think they would be OK without me financially, but it would strain things a little bit for them. They would have to shuffle some of their financial priorities. But honestly, I dont care any more.  I care about them as my family, but not at the expense of my sanity and feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to move out regardless of how it would impact them?",

After our first year of dating my partner broke up with me because they were unable to handle the distance, I didn't take it well and we didn't talk for 6 months. After 6 months they messaged me and our relationship rekindled and is going reasonably well except for the distance. My partner's currently trying to get their top surgery through the nhs. I'm in uni. Near the start we decided that my partner would be the one to move because they insisted, as well as me preferring my city because the both of us are able to walk down the street without people glaring. As the distance was the issue last time I wanted to try and get moved in asap, long distance is shit and as we're both young in low paying jobs at most we can afford to see each other 3 times a year.\n\nMy partner going to move when they got info that they could get an appointment with a gender therapist to get evaluated for top surgery in March last year and appointments are being organised for applicants from mid 2017 atm. Obviously it's going to take a long time; I suggested that I quit uni and move to England until my partner would be able to move here. My partner doesn't like this idea and keeps insisting that I shouldn't give up my future, I've got friends here etc. I know that they care about me and don't want to be the reason I quit school but it's turned into a 'nobody can move' situation and it's stressful. Our relationship is great when we're together and I'm very happy with them.\n\nOver the past couple of months I've been suggesting things like dropping out or my partner moving in and we get a bank loan and get their surgery done here through private care.

It feels like we're never going to have an actual relationship and I keep getting upset over the smallest things and it always ends with the same 'move in' 'I can't' conversation.

He is not my motherâ€™s child, only my fatherâ€™s. His real mother is a deadbeat. However if he came out I am certain my father would come around to it, only because over the years heâ€™s gradually distanced himself from our old church because of how hateful the pastorsâ€™ associates have become toward gay people. Itâ€™s not an endorsement of their lifestyle, but it is a refusal to despise them. However he still thinks he has the right to deny baking a cake for them. \n\nI disagree with my father and my parentsâ€™ conservativeness, but have yet to vocalize said disagreements. I merely keep a safe distance since Iâ€™m in college. My brother however still tries to please them because I think he is conflicted. He still has Christian ideals and prays but his friends donâ€™t share the same values (a lot of them are off the books weed/coke  dealers). Heâ€™s a bit of an alcoholic because of the fights he got into with our controlling parents growing up and I wouldnâ€™t call him a deadbeat because heâ€™s a very skilled manager at a retail store and did graduate college buuut all his free time is spent partying and abusing drugs as he tries to support his friendsâ€™ rap career (heâ€™s apart of their group and frankly they suck. I wouldnâ€™t disparage them if they didnâ€™t pretend to be better than they are or ridicule me for being book smart, but the only person in their group that has a shot at making it is their producer because he can make beats in the style of many other producers. Lyrically speaking they need some help.)\n\nMy brother is a pretty macho fella. I am not. I do like sports, i play with my friends, but i donâ€™t have as much muscle mass as him despite being toned/muscular myself. He used to bully me because he was treated as the problem child by my parents growing up but that all changed when i played sports in high school. I wouldnâ€™t call him â€œnice,â€? but i would say he became invested in my athletic career and gave me helpful pointers, but it was primarily to preserve his reputation at our high school/college. His athletic career was the only way he could gain favor with my dad who served in the military. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier his friends are into drug abuse. He is heavily invested in a thuggish image that he maintains on his private instagram. He used to constantly pick on me for being a square and doing well in high school and college. I donâ€™t resent him as much because I understand where heâ€™s coming from and Iâ€™ve secretly been going to therapy for the last year to feel better about myself. I wouldnâ€™t say I am at 100%, but I am far more confident than I used to be. Occasionally though i will be reminded of something he did and itâ€™ll fuck up my whole day. (nitpicking my athletic performance in front of others, calling me gay as a kid cause I was into opera and Sailor Moon, criticizing me in front of our veteran of a dad when i wore brighter colors, belittling my interest in theater, etc.) One day he called me crying while drunk and apologized for being an asshole, but he hasnâ€™t really changed much. Heâ€™ll still occasionally call me pansy or queer, despite my protests. I only know about him being gay because he opened up to me while under the influence, and told me â€œto never mention it againâ€? when he sobered up. One of his friends mentioned it in front of me and he was pissed. \n\nAnyhoo, I attended a Christmas Eve family event and brought two friends. Word got around that I made the honor roll. He scoffed and rolled his eyes. My mother made a smart ass remark at my brothersâ€™ expense. She said she meant it as a joke but it pissed him off. He glared at her and walked out. He returned a couple of hours later and talked to her privately, but he was drunk as fuck. I could tell by his staggering. She urged him to drink some water and sober up and he initially listened but couldnâ€™t resist the call of my cousins playing basketball in the driveway. \n\nHe began to show off in front of my younger cousins. He was sloppy and unnecessarily aggressive. My cousins are 14, 16, and 17. I was already outside with my friends watching and we decided to go to one of their houses. My brother continuously taunted me as I left and threw the basketball at my head. I gave him the bird as I was slowly losing my cool then he continued to taunt me â€œcone here pussy, come play with me ya little queerâ€? etc etc and I lost it. â€œYoure the only real queer around here.â€? He came at me but I ran away and all my friends and cousins subdued him. He cursed me as I got into my car and my dad and all the dudes came outside to find out what happened. He brushed it off and walked away. I havenâ€™t talked to him since and he didnâ€™t show up for Christmas breakfast. \n\nI really hate that I outted him but thereâ€™s a part of me that feels good about it. I finally hurt him. But I outted him in front of my cousins who Iâ€™m certain relayed the info to my uncle and father. Dads been pretty stern all morning. \n\nAITA? Could there have been a better way to go around this? He just makes me feel so weak and heâ€™s projected his weakness and â€œâ€?effiminacyâ€?â€? on to me for so fucking long and it felt good to hurt him back. I just hate that it was at an inconvenient time for him and could mar his already shit relationship with our parents. Being closeted is more-so about survival than anything else and i feel like shit\n\nTLDR; My closeted bully of an older brother got mad at me at Christmas Eve dinner bc my mom showed off my academic success at his expense. He taunted me while playing basketball calling me pansy and queer and I outted him. AITA?",

I havenâ€™t seen him since but he would text me randomly asking why I didnâ€™t love him even though I had explained my reasoning over the phone. I didnâ€™t usually respond to these texts since I had already said what I wanted to when we broke up.\n\nIt didnâ€™t really become a major problem until one day he sent over 100 texts within an hour demanding to see me and saying he was going to commit suicide if he didnâ€™t. I texted him back and his attitude immediately flipped and started cracking jokes which I found kind of scary to be honest. I texted one of his friends to keep an eye on him and then blocked him on all channels. \n\nMy mom said I have a responsibility to make sure heâ€™s okay and I should check on him every week but my dad said blocking him was the right move.\n\nAITA?\n",

            "input": "So I went to a friends house this last weekend and after staying I left and got food, gas and a car wash. I did not care to much about where I went to for the was so I decided to use the gas station one that just uses pressure washers. I have a new car and only want to get the salt and dirt off from the past week, and I don't like to go to ones that have the big bush washers in fear they could scratch my car so this was perfect. I get gas and pay for the wash there at the pump and get in line.\n\nOnce in line (about 7 cars ahead of me due to it being a Saturday) I notice that someone has stopped right after they exit the wash and is drying their car by hand. I think nothing of it until I see the next car is doing the same thing. After a little while I notice its the same guy, so someone is out there drying cars after. I assume its a homeless guy just trying to be nice and looking for cash. I figure I will tell him no thank you since I have no cash on me, usually never do unless I need it. When I go to a big car wash I have $$ to tip the people who take care of the car after the wash. Once I get closer and I'm about the 3rd car in line I notice this is an employee (not in uniform). They are going in and out of the side door of the wash to the front of the line, doing something and then going back in to go and dry cars. After investigating I see what he is doing.\n\nFirst he goes out to the front of the line, makes sure the car can pay or enter code and then proceeds to use a scrub brush and cleans the rims, salt areas, headlights and bumpers. He then goes into the side door and out the other side to catch the car coming out to dry it.\n\nNOTE: There is no sign or anything stating someone is doing this. \n\nI just let they guy do his thing, the brush looks new when I see him do it to the car in front of me so I figure there is low risk if him scratching my new car, by new I mean 2019 on a lease new. He brushes, I enter my code and go into the wash. My next assumption is that the blow dryer does not work, that's why he is out here. The area the station is at is a nicer part of town and the gas station was clean and well kept. So I go with this assumption and as I exit the wash, the blow dryer works. So I let it do its thing and as I pull up he walks up and just starts drying. I was going to tell him no thank you but could not do it quick enough before he was already drying so I let him. He comes to the window as I am about to pull away and just looks at me, I roll down the window and he says he is working for tips and next time to do that. I nod and drive off. He looked super annoyed and pissed when I had nothing but again, there was nothing saying he was going to be there and this is not a normal part of a gas station car wash. AITA??",

Please feel free to skip my rambles to the tl;dr\n\nAbout 5 months ago I (23F) started talking to this guy (25M) I met on tinder, who Iâ€™ll call TG (for tinder guy). We hit it off and after a few weeks of hanging out became friends with benefits. This lasted around 4 months before I started to develop feelings. I believe it is important to be honest about these things so I told him how I was feeling right when I realized. I told him he had no obligation to feel the same way, but that I wanted to know where his head was at so I didnâ€™t spend my time pining for a guy just to have my heart broken. To me, getting rejected was a lot easier and simpler when my feelings were still pretty new and not that deep. TG told me that he appreciated my honesty and enjoyed hanging out with me but he saw me as more of a friend than a girlfriend. Getting rejected obviously hurt, but that was the response I was expecting. I told him that I respected that but that I needed some time before we could start being friends and he agreed. Overall, we ended things on pretty good terms.\n\nWith the exception of him sending a few drunk 3 am texts asking for sex (that despite the temptation, I didnâ€™t respond to), we didnâ€™t communicate and we live far enough away that I never had to run into him in public.\n\nDuring the time when we were fwb, TG mentioned that he was looking for jobs in the finance industry and I told him my dad is the VP of a pretty large finance company. (For anyone who thinks he used me to get to my dad: we met randomly on tinder, I have a pretty common last name, and we had already been hooking up for a few weeks when I told him).\n\nAfter about a month after we ended things, I get a text from TG during waking hours asking if I could put in a good word for him with my dad for a job at the company my dad works at. My dad has nothing to do with interviewing/hiring employees, but obviously a recommendation from the companyâ€™s VP would be a major advantage. I told TG that I did not feel comfortable doing that. TG then accused me as being vindictive and that I was trying to punish him for not wanting to be my boyfriend. My dad has no idea that TG exists, I have never posted anything with him or about him on social media and I donâ€™t tell my father about the guys I casually hook up with. If I was telling my dad that TG was a terrible person who he shouldnâ€™t hire, then I would 100% understand that I would be the vindictive assholeâ€¦ but Iâ€™m not doing anything like that. TG is in a no better or worse situation from knowing me.\n\nThe part that makes me feel like an asshole is that if TG was my boyfriend, I would ask my dad to recommend him in a heartbeat. So its not like Iâ€™m on some moral high ground where jobs should only gotten solely on the basis of merit. Ideally, that would be the case, but I understand in the real world (especially the finance world), who you know matters. TG is a good guy who I know is qualified and I would be happy for him if he got the job, but I just donâ€™t want to ask my dad do to this for him. Does that make me the asshole?\n\n**tl;dr** for not asking my dad to recommend my former fwb for a job.",

My mum has remained single since and went through a great deal of mental issues in the aftermath (that's a whole other story) whereas my dad has gone through his 2nd marriage, moved country, and is now on his 3rd.\n\nSince my dad moved away, it's been difficult to keep in contact with him. Even more so after he began living with his partner and her 2 children. This is evident when, at the beginning of this year, I find out via Facebook photos that he came back to the country and married his current wife without letting either myself or my brother know (we are now 17 and 26) despite him also taking the time to visit my brother afterwards. \n\nIn any case, we come to last month where I discover (once again, via Facebook photos) that my dad and his wife have welcomed a child into the world. Even now, I don't know how to feel about this, and neither does my brother who found out the same way.

We at first didnâ€™t engage much, but then had to work together, and automatically became friends. \nSince then, weâ€™ve been seeing and texting each other regularly, and it felt good to have found someone who is like the friendship equivalent of a soulmate. To say, after watching the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, we said that if we ever end up alone in our 40s, we will date each other. \n\nThings between us have always been easy. We were at first a trio, but the other girl, L (30F), has been a true pain. She knew D for a couple of years longer, and has seen me like the intruder in a way. She acted like she was my friend, but then would tell D how I was toxic for her, when really she was the one who was toxic, and trying to be Dâ€™s only friend and making her her property in a way. \n\nThis didnâ€™t put a strain in my relationship with D, and more so, reinforced it. We had each otherâ€™s back. \n\nTwo years ago, I went through a really tough break up, and at the time D had gotten into a relationship with a very manipulative guy. He would dictate her every move, and was all around a bad guy. I warned her, and told her to break it off. She didnâ€™t really listen, as I was very much in the slump and couldnâ€™t possibly rationalise it all with her. \n\nShe ended up breaking up in February 2017, which was a relief for me, but then she spent the entire year crying about how much of a monster he was, although I had warned her multiple times that he was sucking the life out of her. \n\nThings didnâ€™t get better, when she found out she had a strain of HPV that gave her condylomas, and the timing matched with when she was with that guy. I did my best to be there for her, and reassure her that it wasnâ€™t the end of the world. Offered to be with her when she went to the gynaecologist, and also when she went to get them lasered off. I listened to her on the phone hours at the time, when she cried because of him, thought she would never be able to be with someone ever again, and beating herself about it all. She had zero self esteem at that point. \n\nI did what any best friend would do, and explained to her that all of this wasnâ€™t true, that she wasnâ€™t worthless, and will find someone who will be beyond her expectations. \n\n\nAll through it all, she barely inquired how I was doing. I was going through a shit year, and except some times when I would break down in front of her, she was basically inexistant. Never asked how I was holding up, never offered to cheer me up. I get it. She was going through her own stuff, and I couldnâ€™t hold her accountable for it. \n\nSo I sucked it up. \n\n\nAt the end of 2017, she started seeing this guy, who was initially trying to get together with me, but I rejected him over and over, because I was still hoping my ex would come back, and truly, he wasnâ€™t my type personality wise. I need someone who is very active, quick witted, who can make me laugh, and who isnâ€™t in some sort of half asleep state all the time. \n\nBut anyway, the guy didnâ€™t want a relationship, and was just profiting off her state to get sex, basically living at her place and not spending a dime when helping with groceries or anything. She even did his laundry. FFS. What king of man child is that. \n\nHere again, I told her he wasnâ€™t a good fit for her, that he used her as a surrogate mother who would also have sex with him. She didnâ€™t listen. She needed the attention and told me it felt great that he would be here at night to stroke her hair. Fine. \n\n\nThen he started dropping the ball continuously. \nThey established they would have a sort of open relationship. Except he knew first hand that she wasnâ€™t going to act on anything because she was unable to trust men anymore. He is very socially awkward and although not ugly at all he still scared people off because heâ€™s just weird at first. He used her weakness to profit from the situation. They said that the rule was no telling. She didnâ€™t want to hear about who he thought was attractive, or who he fucks. \n\nBut he mentioned one girl, even had her name in one of his passwords, called her by her name, you know the drill. \n\nShe kept coming to me crying saying that he fucked up again. At the time, I met my now boyfriend and was doing so much better, so I was ready to be her clutch again although she wasnâ€™t mine for so long. So I listened, warned her, again and again, even had my boyfriend explain that as a guy he thinks his behaviour is unacceptable and so on and so forth. \n\nShe didnâ€™t want to quit it. I told her that she didnâ€™t need to come telling me about those things because it would just make me mad. She still did. And I still listened. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she went on a trip, and she met this guy. They didnâ€™t have sex, like no PiV but did everything around. I asked her why she didnâ€™t go all the way when she recounted her nights with him, absolutely over the moon. And she said that she wasnâ€™t allowed to â€œtake off her clothesâ€? when with someone else. Like. What ? She could do bjâ€™s, get fingered, whatever else, but no PiV. I was mad. I didnâ€™t know about this. How can you call this an open relationship ? Yeah you donâ€™t. Heâ€™s profiting. Because she would excuse him for fucking someone all the way, but he would probably have thought itâ€™s a deal breaker. Screw that. \n\nSince October, Iâ€™ve been very depressed. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely have sex with my boyfriend. I almost donâ€™t eat anymore. Life is all together shitty. But yet again now, although Iâ€™ve told her, she doesnâ€™t give a shit, or at least doesnâ€™t try to be a friend to me. \nSo when she told me that her guy got upset because she â€œsleptâ€? with someone, I had enough. She was in tears saying that she fucked things up, and I told her I didnâ€™t want to hear it. \n\nI went to leave, and she called me selfish. She doesnâ€™t seem to realise that I have been suicidal, but I should somehow give a shit about her shitty relationship when Iâ€™m this down. \n\nI snapped at her and said that I donâ€™t give a crap if she feels bad, because once again I warned her multiple times that this guy is a piece of work, and that she shouldnâ€™t have agreed to anything with him if she wasnâ€™t able to put up with it. \n\nNow I think our relationship is broken and there might be no going back unless she accepts that Iâ€™m also hurting in my own way, and have other things on my mind. She wonâ€™t apologise because she thinks Iâ€™ve overreacted, but I donâ€™t see it. \n\nSo AITA for telling her to fuck off ? \n",

Hoping to get some insight, especially from couples who experienced similar situations and young professionals. \n\nMy SO and I are looking to move apartments. Currently our commutes are a blessing, 30 mins door to door max. While an ideal situation, lately my SO has been entertaining the idea of a new area that is at least an hour commute each way. \n\nFurther out we could afford a bigger, newer space with loads of amenities. Our money could go almost 25% further. He wants a home office where he can close the door and take important client meetings. He travels once a month for work and the area would be close to two major airports. \n\nI wouldnâ€™t mind this in the least bit if we had a mortgage and kids, but as it stands now we are a young, childless couple renting while trying to save money for a down payment for a house. Money aside, my biggest concern is that 2hr/day commute which feels unnecessary and could even backfire on us. \n\nHis job is extremely stressful and time consuming. He will be traveling a lot. Heâ€™s already up to his eyeballs in work and will no doubt only get busier. Since Iâ€™m not making as much or stressed as much as he is, I naturally would take on more responsibilities around the house to ease his day and streamline our lives, like cleaning, cooking, chores and appointments, etc. \n\nI (at least in the foreseeable future) will not have the flexibility to work from home like he does. I work full time and, if we make this move, I will spend 2 hours commuting each day. Not only will I have to leave earlier in the morning, I will be coming home later. Iâ€™m looking for a higher paying position now that will no doubt be more time consuming, so it could mean Iâ€™ll be home an additional hour or two later every day. \n\nThe move so far out from work feels draining and unnecessary. I would prefer to be closer to work without the extra space and amenities and get home in time to make dinner and clean up, instead of coming home after a long day and a longer commute to cook and clean, only to do it all over again eight hours later. \n\nUltimately, I want to ease the weight of his job, but I feel like he doesnâ€™t realize how a move this far out might backfire on us long term. The space would be super nice but the time and energy would be stretched thin. \n\nEventually when we do have a family and house 1hr+ out from work, by that time Iâ€™ll either be working part time or staying at home with the kids while theyâ€™re young. Again the commute is not the issue m, itâ€™s the fact that I wonâ€™t be able to do as much as I want around the house to support our family without bleeding myself dry or relying on him to take on a large portion of the responsibilities. \n\nI also donâ€™t want to sound like Iâ€™m trying to get out of an 1hr+ commute because Iâ€™m lazy or something. Or maybe I am being lazy, you guys tell me! I donâ€™t have much real world experience and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the first or the last person to take on a longer commute. In the end, I would hate for this to put unnecessary strain on us and create any imbalance or resentment. Thanks for reading!",

The more I think about it though the more the situation rubs me the wrong way. What if it was an emergency? I dunno I'm sure he would have said something. What do you think?",

Everyone told me she was the worst but I tried to give her a chance anyways because I donâ€™t like to judge people based off rumors. I tried to be nice at school but in the end she turned out to be exactly the person everyone told me she was (somewhat toxic, really narcissistic.) School finished and I never heard from her again. \n\nI got a job at my current location a few months ago, and X got hired where I work about a week ago. Since then sheâ€™s been causing a lot of problems. For example when the assistant manager called her out on charging too much and stealing products, X went straight to the manager and said she felt â€œattacked.â€? Most recently our manager created a â€œchore chartâ€? for us. We donâ€™t get paid to do these things. If it was stuff that I should be doing anyways like cleaning up after myself it would be fine but itâ€™s things that take at least 1+ hour of time that Iâ€™m not getting paid to do. So when I was talking about it to another coworker of mine X overheard us and went straight to the manager and told her basically everything we said. Now weâ€™ve all decided to stop talking to her completely because she obviously has no interest in being our friend anyways and we canâ€™t trust her with information. I mean it seems justified but I still feel like Iâ€™m being mean. AITA?",

I don't mind my boyfriend smoking with his friends so long as I'm not completely left alone. \n\nUnfortunately, this has happened 3 times already. Or more, I don't really remember. At a friends house party, my boyfriend left with his friends to go smoke because they know I don't really like it, which leaves me with a bunch of people that I don't know. He promised me he'd stay with me the whole time in an effort to make me go with him to the party, but ditches me an hour in. \n\nI was angry but he promised he wouldn't do it again.

I wasn't expecting to keep it forever but at least a year or two. So then I started my job full time (I had to wait a few months before they would let me) and started getting paid decently well.

No one was sitting there so I didn't think twice about doing it. The guy one whole seat over asked me to take my foot off of the seat. I admit I was a little annoyed but I obliged. I said, \"Sorry about that that\" and moved my foot over yet another entire seat. So now there are two entire seats between his body and my seat. I asked him, \"Does this bother you\"? He then moved the two seats over and and with both hands flung my foot off of the seat. I will admit that I was angry and in my anger I asked, \"what the fuck is your problem\"? Or something similar. I was angry enough that I don't remember. (I've texted my BIL to see if he remembers if any of you care or think it is relevant.) Suffice it to say it wasn't nice whatever is was. He refused to look at me. Now that there was someone sitting in front of me I refrained from putting my feet on the seats. \n\nHowever, after that I went from peacefully enjoying opening day with my BIL to being angry. I saw that he was wearing a jersey from the other team so whenever my team did something good I cheered obnoxiously. We were down by a couple runs at that point so there wasn't much to cheer about. For example, loud clapping (more than was necessary) and high fivng the people around us like it was my job. After a half inning he left and did not return. I'm assuming to find better seats. \n\nI don't want to mislead you fine people but, before the incident I was sitting in the sits doing what people do at baseball games. This guy didn't even exist to me. There was no previous conflict. In fact it was pretty serene. I was just thinking about maybe getting a hot dog when this all went down.",

He works a full time job, as do I, and he just went back to school to finish his last semester of college (he failed a couple of courses last time he went 2 years ago, I'll get to that). His job is shift work, and he rotates between afternoons (3-11pm) and nights (11pm-7am). During the day, he goes to school, and he squeezes studying and sleeping in between those hours.\n\nI work a full time job in a city just over an hours job away if traffic is good. It's a very demanding job, and I often have to take work home with me. I do the majority of the care of our son, obviously because my fiance is so busy. I'm also 6 months pregnant.\n\nNow, the AITA part. My fiance often spends very long hours in the garage, staying up all night studying or doing other projects (he's just getting into wood working and likes doing renos on our house). The big issue though is that my fiance is an alcoholic. 90% of the time he pulls these all-nighters, he drinks. He's often running himself dead because his life is so demanding right now, and to top it off he refusing to see my view: that staying up all night like he does is a terrible, negative habit that is destroying him and our relationship. I've argued that he doesn't study as effectively if he's running on no sleep and drinking. I've tried explaining that it's terrible for his health. I've tried explaining that when he does this, it falls on me to make sure that he gets out of bed to go to work and go to school, and he's damn near impossible to wake up. He often gets mad at me for waking him. It's also the exact kind of environment and habit he should be avoiding because he trying to quit drinking. This kind of behaviour is why he ended up failing the two courses he's retaking in the first place. \n\nThe biggest kicker is, though, that I just really want to spend more time with him. I feel so alone, and I feel like he could spend more time with his family if he just chose to sleep at night and do the things he needs to do during the day/evening. He misses out on spending time and doing things with us and he doesn't see it because he's not there to notice it. I even offered to help him study. He's a wonderful person that works harder than anyone I know. I love him very much.\n\nHe says that I'm being controlling and selfish because this is one thing he enjoys doing and I want to take it from him. He says he feels like a puppet on a string that is expected to do things when I want regardless of how he feels. He explained that he works shift work and his sleep schedule is messed up to begin with, so he can't always sleep. \n\nI could go on for a while longer, especially about his drinking, but I want to keep it to just this one thing\n\nTL;DR: My fiance works full time and goes to school part time, and often stays up all night drinking and studying. AITA for wanting him to spend more time with his family and go to bed at night instead?",

I told him that I would not drive him to work in the morning because I did not expect the roads to clear up and it was very scary driving to pick him up. There is a bus stop two or three blocks from my apt that he could take directly to work.\n\nNext day: He leaves to go to the bus stop and when he sees the streets he immediately snapchats me that I am an ass for not driving him because the streets are fine (which I did not know). He gets to the bus stop and asks me to drive him because the bus won't be there for another 10 minutes or so. I am mildly sick and he was already at the bus stop so I said no, that I would probably get to him at the same time as the bus anyway.\n\nSo he's all mad at me now for not driving him and I'm mad at him for being mad at me because I do not owe him rides, he should plan better to get to his job, and he called me an ass without apologizing.

She would call me names such as slut and prostitute. She also made me feel extremely insecure about my looks and my weight. She emotionally blackmails me constantly, saying how if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be where I am today.\n\nThis is mostly because her first husband(my biological father) was complete human garbage and it has affected her way of thinking about men and life in general.Luckily, she remarried a man when I was about 10 years old who is now my stepfather, who I am completely grateful for. But because of this, she feels that I owe her forever because she raised me when she quotes, \"I could have just left you to die with your father\"\n\nFast forward now at 25, I've been studying overseas in Australia for 3 years, and planning to stay because I really like it here. I was the one who tried to convince my parents for them not to send me to Australia because it was way too expensive and I didn't want my dad to be so financially burdened. But they told me they think I would have better career opportunities there. So here I am. I found a part time job and tried to helped my dad to reduce some bills like partially supporting two of my siblings who are also studying here with me. One of the major reasons for sending me over is so they can \"find a good husband\". I'm Asian, so I come from a relatively conservative culture. My parents prefer it I stick to my \"own kind\". I have many relatives here and my mother puts them on the pedestal as my cousins have managed to find good and rich husbands of \"their own kind\" and live such a happy life, so I should be like them. \n\nI'm dating an Australian man, who treats me well, respects me, supports me more than anyone I have ever dated regardless of race. My parents disapprove of him being alot older than me and they disapprove that he is not of \"my own kind\", claiming that Australians have high tendency to be abusive, rapists etc which I find complete and utter bullshit. After finding out I have been dating him for months, my mom confronted me and said I should break up with him and move to another state. I told her no because I am an adult so I can make my own decisions.\n\nYou must be wondering how I know what she's doing back home. I have a 20 year old sister back home who being verbally abused by my parents as well. She has no reason to exaggerate or lie to me about what my mom has been saying because she would actually benefit from it more by siding with my mother. My sister is the only one in the family who stands by my side. My mother has successfully turned everyone else against me, like my dad and younger brother.\n \nMy mother has also tarnished my name in my hometown to my friends and extended family by telling everyone that I'm a useless whore who left the family. I feel like cutting my mother off is the best solution for my own wellbeing and sanity. ",

My friend actually sent them to her, and X called back sobbing and threatening to call the cops. \n     Y was understandably upset that I told her to send them, because I convinced her to send the photos and then she had to deal with X and her reaction. I thought Y knew about her phobia, and therefore wouldnâ€™t send them to avoid triggering her. Y didnâ€™t know, and sent her the photos because I told her to. I didnâ€™t stop Y from sending the photos, but I didnâ€™t really have much of a chance to as it was too late when I learned that she had actually sent them. The photos were very cartoonish and fake-looking, and I am having trouble believing that it would evoke such a response in her. X is known to overreact to everything and seek for attention. \n     The next day, I had a serious allergic reaction while I was running, and I started to go into anaphylactic shock. I had the worst itching of my life, my throat started to close up, I experienced the worse stomach cramps Iâ€™ve ever had, threw up multiple times, nearly shit myself, and I literally couldnâ€™t walk so I had to be picked up in a truck by a park ranger and driven to the trail entrance so the ambulance could take me to the hospital. If it wasnâ€™t for the two friends I had helping me and calling the park ranger, I could have died. The experience was traumatic for me and it took me a while to get over it. \n     I was still recovering from the physical symptoms of the allergic reaction when I heard X went around telling people that â€œgoing into anaphylactic shock was karma for what I did to herâ€?. I canâ€™t believe she thinks I deserve that for jokingly telling a friend to send her badly faked pictures of someone throwing up. I understand that phobias can be serious, but knowing her I feel like she overreacted and exaggerated her phobia for attention because thatâ€™s just the type of person she is. \n     Am I the asshole for telling Y to send those photos, even though I wasnâ€™t serious? Am I justified in being upset at what X said, or did I deserve anaphylactic shock?\n     TL;DR: I used to be friends with someone who has a vomit phobia. As a joke, I tell one of my other friends to send her some obviously fake photos of people vomiting. She goes hysterical, cries and threatens to call the police. The next day, I nearly die from an allergic reaction and she tells people that I deserved it for what I did to her. ",

I donâ€™t want to get too into their history, because itâ€™s winding, complicated and personal, so Iâ€™ll summarise it as quickly as I can. My stepdad has been around since we were 2 and 3 respectively. When we were young, we were very close. As we got older, my stepdad was very very strict and could be very cruel verbally at times. My brother was extremely wild and did a lot of dangerous and illegal things. I want to say that I genuinely donâ€™t think either of them is blameless, though I genuinely think Iâ€™m too close to the issue to asses it objectively, seeing as I grew up alongside my brother. \n\nA few years back, they had a really big falling out. They both said a lot of terrible and very over the line things and they both made a lot of threats. My brother left by choice and my stepdad was glad. My brother is 24, lives in an apartment paid for by our biological dad (who has never been much of a dad to either of us in any ways except occasionally financial). Itâ€™s a very upper class, expensive apartment. He has no job and receives hundreds of dollars per week from both our parents and grandparents. \n\nMy mother has spent the last three years trying to force them to make peace. Itâ€™s very, very painful for her and has taken a huge toll on both relationships. My brother says my mum shouldâ€™ve picked us over our stepdad. Every time we see my brother, my mum tries to convince him that they should make peace. My brother swears and screams and often walks off. In 3 years, his answer has never wavered.\n\nEvery year, we go away one night for Christmas. Iâ€™m on that night away as we speak. My mother brought it up (theyâ€™re both intoxicated) and my brother got angry immediately and started telling her if she kept doing it, heâ€™d leave. \n\nMy mum asked me, in front of my brother, to tell my brother he should do it. She got emotional and begged me to tell him he has to forgive my stepdad. I said I didnâ€™t want to be involved (a stance Iâ€™ve held for all 3 years) and she got very angry and now wonâ€™t speak with me.\n\nMy problem with taking a side is that Iâ€™m very torn. My relationships with both my brother and stepdad are very, very tense. My brother is known to fly off the handle and Iâ€™m afraid that if I tried to take a side, heâ€™d never forgive me and Iâ€™d be burned out too. I genuinely believe Iâ€™m too close to the situation. I have a lot of feelings about both of them and my opinion changes a lot depending on what happens and how people act. I feel like Iâ€™m too close to it all to decide and like I donâ€™t want to sway people to do â€œthe right thingâ€? when Iâ€™m not even sure what the right thing is.\n\nOn the one hand, my brother is selfish, angry and aggressive. On the other, I know he harbours a lot of abandonment issues and that heâ€™s still very hurt and emotional about my stepdad. My stepdad is angry, mean and cold. He definitely said things he shouldnâ€™t have said to us (with us as children at the time). On the other hand, heâ€™s been married to my mum almost 20 years and I know she loves him. My mum is overemotional, but sheâ€™s also one of my best friends in the word. She desperately wants me to side with her, but Iâ€™m afraid by siding with her, Iâ€™ll make everything ten times worse.\n\nI hope this doesnâ€™t come across as a shit post or something, because being so close to it and with everyone around me being so emotional with the issue, Iâ€™m genuinely unsure if what Iâ€™m doing is right. My mum has been loyal to me and I donâ€™t want to be disloyal to her, but I donâ€™t want to force something and make everything worse and potentially lose my brother entirely. \n\nTL;DR: my brother and my stepdad hate each other and my mum wants me to force them to make peace. I donâ€™t feel like I can be a part of it, but thatâ€™s making her think Iâ€™m disloyal to her. AITA? \n\nAlso, sorry for the formatting, Iâ€™m sitting in a hotel on my mobile. ",

Not sure how to describe his attitude about it really, he was just really content and loved life I guess.

Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn.

I think it's preposterous that servers, drivers, or members of any profession should be paid less than minimum wage with the assumption that tips will make up the difference. That being said, I accept that the system is not going to change anytime soon, and so I make sure to tip decently when I visit restaurants. (Never less than 15% unless the server was actively rude, 20% as a baseline for slightly above average service). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, when I order delivery, in addition to an expected tip, there is a flat delivery charge (usually $2) that is explicitly NOT a tip to the drivers. Because of this, I have developed a system where, when I do order out by myself, I usually order a few meals, eat one immediately, and have the others as leftovers. In this case, I tip 20% of what one meal would have cost, on top of the standard delivery fee. This dilutes the fee and the tip over several meals, making the price of delivery worth it for me. The amount of work that the driver does is unchanged from 1-3 meals, so I feel that tipping the same amount is justified. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis leads to a second discussion. I brought up my habits at a party last night, and got mixed responses. One friend, who had been a delivery driver in the past, claimed that this was unacceptable. He told me that his wages were only $4/hr, that his only other income was tips, and that even with 20% tips he would often not make minimum wage. I agreed with him that the system was flawed, and told him that everyone in his position should simply find another job. If enough drivers don't keep their position due to the unfair system, wages will increase. (He had already done this, moving from food delivery to another, standard salary job). In areas of poverty, I understand that sometimes, you take what you can get, but this is a middle class neighborhood with plenty of jobs available that do not require any significant level of education. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for (1) ordering more food for takeout but tipping the same, and/or (2) believing that workers should protest a crappy system by changing jobs?

There have been a handful of fall-outs, I've reached out to her to make amends, asked if I've done anything wrong but all in all its been a fairly direct conflict-free relationship. \n\nI now actively dislike Katie. She complains all the time, makes a huge deal out of her problems, tries to one up me and Gemma, disagrees with us just to disagree...She has blamed me for things going wrong which have been nothing to do with me, bitched about me to my other flatmates, rolled my eyes at me when I've contributed to group work at uni...it's a hostile environment and I try my best not to rise to it. It's worsened my social anxieties and is a contributing factor to starting CBT a month ago.\n\nKatie's birthday is in 2 weeks and is having a dinner party style celebration in our flat. She's inviting our friendship group (we share most of our friends) and asking everyone to bring a dish. If this wasn't in my flat, I wouldn't go but really want to avoid sparking any drama. However, I'm torn as to whether to get her a present or even a card. I want to avoid making a statement by not getting her anything or stir up any drama, yet I don't really think she deserves anything from me. That said, I'm still grateful for the effort she put into my birthday. Gemma is getting her a card and present as they'd been best friends for a few years before this and I don't think Katie knows that Gamma doesn't consider her a friend any more. \n\nSo, WIBTA for not getting her a present? Should I just get her a card? Or even nothing at all? \n\nTldr; I don't like my flatmate. She organised my birthday party. WIBTA for not getting her anything for her birthday?",

For the most part they were little things a few times a day, winking or sticking their tongue out at me when things said could be taken \"sexually\". But sometimes there were events that really took it farther like \"I know you wanna touch my butt\" and offering me the opportunity or verbally suggesting other romantic or \"sexual\" things rather than the more subtle winking. It was at a point where several of our mutual friends believed they were interested in me. Until after a month of it they somewhat abruptly declared that they is not interested in me or anyone else in the friend group and would never date any of us. Unknown to them I did have a crush on them before the flirting started, but I would rather keep a friend than risk losing it over that.\n\nFor the next few days I spent very little time with friends. I had a big homework assignment to do so they felt like I was avoiding them, which I kind of was. I needed time alone to get over the \"broken heart\". Afterward we talked a little and they voiced how their flirting meant absolutely nothing and they were not interested in me at all.\n\nNow things are awkward between us and we are no longer as good of friends as we used to be. they claims that since then I am sometimes hostile towards them. I just feel awkward at this point and sometimes jealous of those who are closer friends with them than I am now.\n\nI cannot help but be upset at them and get jealous or hurt. I am no longer one of their best friends. I know its not 100% their fault but did i overreact? AITA?",

I went to the McDonaldâ€™s up the street from me and went in for an application. The next day I turned in my application and got an interview. You know normal stuff for when you get a job. \n\n\nWhen I ended up getting the job my first day of work was just me bagging up the food and handing it out to the people in the dining area. After my first week I started working morning on the weekends and thatâ€™s where I met creepo. When he first saw me he was like â€œso youâ€™re ________.â€? And I said â€œyeah this is my first time ever having a jobâ€? and he went in for a high five and said â€œWow thatâ€™s amazing!â€? When I gave him a high five he kinda held my hand for a minute.  Kinda weird but didnâ€™t think much about it. \n\n\nFast forward to a few weeks working the morning shifts and he decided to move me to drive thru where I take the orders and give the food to the customers. Itâ€™s probably my most favorite position. But its always just him and I alone until 11 which gives him at least 4 hours alone with me. This is when he starts to act weirder. \n\n\nI would be taking an order and heâ€™ll come up behind me and start playing with my hair and saying â€œLook at you working hard.â€? In the most uncomfortable sexual voice. Then later, I was making an iced coffee for the customer. While I was stirring the spoon around to mix the coffee and the cream he grabbed my arm gently and just held it there. I push my arm away from his grip and he called me rude. \n\n\nI like to do my makeup like many other 16 year old girls do. So Iâ€™ll sometimes walk into work after school and have eyeshadow or eyeliner and the first thing he says to me is â€œYou look beautiful today.â€? And grabs my hand softly like heâ€™s about to hold it. After these encounters with him I decided enough was enough and I told my boyfriend and he called my McDonaldâ€™s and talked to the store manager who eventually called me the next day. \n\n\nThe store manager said sheâ€™d like to hear both sides of the story but I kind of feel bad for telling on him. I know what he was doing was wrong but I guess I feel bad because I donâ€™t want him to find out I said anything so that if he doesnâ€™t get fired that Iâ€™d have to be around him again. Let me remind you, Iâ€™m 16 and heâ€™s around mid 40â€™s.  Pray for me tomorrow when I see him again. ",

Theres this one guy Iâ€™ve been friends with since the beginning of the fall semester that I sometimes give rides home to because 1. Itâ€™s RIGHT on the way for me going home and 2. He walks, doesnâ€™t have someone to pick him up, and carries a lot of stuff, especially for the classes heâ€™s taking this semester). \n\nNow, thereâ€™s this other guy who is also his age who has been hanging with us a bit more recently this semester. He usually has a ride (Iâ€™m assuming from family). One time he wanted to hang out a little bit more after classes with me and my other friend so he asked if he could get a ride home to be able to hang out a little longer and I said sure and he called off his ride. No big deal. \n\nIâ€™ve noticed now he tends to hang around more often after classes and whenever my one friend who walks asks if I could drop him off, he piggybacks on it right after him, which makes me feel like I have to say yes if I said yes to my other friend. He lives about 6 minutes from where I live but at the same time itâ€™s still kind of a detour for me and the car I have isnâ€™t kind with gas; itâ€™s not a lot but it is at the same time. \n\nSo now itâ€™s gotten to the point where it seems like he called off his previous arrangement for rides and kind of assumes Iâ€™ll say yes. I had to race home for something I had to do after school the last I saw them and felt bad for having to say no to both, but also to my friend who walks because it was raining and cold that day. Idk hes a really nice guy and I honestly believe he just wants to be able to hang out with us a little bit more, and I kind of feel like a dick for having this bother me so much.

I want to make sure you obtain all the information:\n\nI met this person (call him TOM)on my 22nd birthday, I was drunk and with the help of liquid courage I managed to go up to TOM and ask for his number. The next day I he messaged me to save his number for the next time I go out. I was shocked that it worked lol \\[TOM also messaged me saying he would do â€˜dirty thingsâ€™ to me, I figured TOM liked me (probably a red flag here if he was willing to do things like that on such a short period of timeâ€¦)\\] Regardless.\n\nStarting out as friends, we would meet up when we both had off which was the weekends only. Things were cool for several months. Time passes, I remember I did the whole â€œwhat are we?â€? and he kind of froze. I remember getting upset and that was a red flag there, but this was my first time with someone (I thought I was going to fast with it) so I ignored it. Carried on our relationship, we went out here and there, I guess you could say we were dating (I thought we were, and I assumed that). His birthday came, I gave a few cool gifts and what not. Then the holidays, Thanksgiving and then Christmas I did the same. At this point, he introduced me to his friends that were nice to me. So, in return, I tried to be as nice as possible and befriend them because my thinking is if you wanted to date someone you need to be cool with their friends &amp; fam. Everything was cool until\n\nChristmas Break//New Yearâ€™s\n\n\\*Remember this whole time Iâ€™m going to college and this was my first time ever to be on my own (away from home). During my Christmas break I decided to stay at my place so I was alone and my work is seasonal so I was literally doing nothing. \n\n\\-----&gt;  New Years. New Year seem to be a problem. Last year, I was with my parents (theyâ€™re in late 70s)  they went to bed at 7pm! So I didnâ€™t want to go home to celebrate my new year like that. Comes the evening I get a random message from TOMâ€™s friend asking me to go out with them for the New Year. I got excited cause I wasnâ€™t doing anything. Excited to go, I got dressed and geared up to let loose &amp; experience the new year the right way! Then I get a message from TOM saying are you going out with my friends?! ( I should have messaged him about it before saying yes to TOMâ€™s friend, turns out he had to work on New Years) I said yes to going because I got excited. He was really upset and said fine go. \n\nThe next day we talked, he thought it was wrong of me to go with his friends while he wasnâ€™t there \\[ I can understand that \\]. I told him I wouldnâ€™t do it again, things were weird after that, it wasnâ€™t the same. We barely saw each other and talked, it was on and off. I get a message from the same friend that invited me out for NY to go for some food &amp; a show. I decided to go to surprise TOM since he worked later in the day. I went and it was just her, I kind of panicked and didnâ€™t want to be rude and just leave because of what TOM and I agreed on so I went with it. TOMâ€™s friend and I talked about life it was pretty chill, his friend was cool af. He found out, I tried to explain that I was trying to surprise TOM by just showing up unexpectedly. This backfired, things were never the same. We didnâ€™t talk for a while until my birthday. I tried to invite him out to celebrate it but he didnâ€™t show. 3 days later he showed up gave me a gift wished me a happy birthday and left. It was strange, like he felt like he had to do it (return a favor). Time flies and things kinda settle down. **TOM wanted to be friends rather than anything else (via tinder msg)**. I havenâ€™t seen TOM for a while until he asked me to go out with him and his friends. I went, he was drunk and admittedly said things went too fast thatâ€™s what scared him. I wasnâ€™t buying it because we â€œtalkedâ€? for a whole year and he didnâ€™t know what I was majoring in? What my hobbies were? and Iâ€™m sure a lot more. But I know all this information about TOM, itâ€™s just salt in the wounds at this point. I TOLD HIM THAT I HATED HIM FOR NOT CARING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT NIGHT. TOM said that he would â€œalways be nice to meâ€?. Lol, anyway So Iâ€™m not interested in TOM anymore, I was done trying to pursue him. \n\nOne night this summer one of his friends \\*AT THE TIME\\* invited me out to a hot tub party, I went and after that  I got message from his friend saying that he was deleted from all social medias from TOM and was sent a message saying â€œwhy would you try to get with my exâ€?. I was confused. I laughed about it and his friend did too, I moved on. Over time TOM tried to talk to me on social media, I was dry and ignored it.\n\nThen comes this decemeber: my friend wanted me to go out to the club were I met TOM, of course he was there and so was his friends. Iâ€™m not interested in TOM but his friends greeted me we took pictures I kissed his friend on the cheek as a good bye. That night I got a message saying why did I kissed his friend. I sent â€œLMAOâ€? and that was it. Then a week later I was sent a message to go out with a few friends that were gonna be with TOM. This is New Year weekend, so I had nothing like last year and I went to have a few drinks. Cops were out so I stood around till the bar closed. Tom and his friends were done with clubbing and were waiting on a ride. I offered to get an UBER to be nice and to make sure everyone arrives safely to their destinations. Uber X carries on 4 I totally spaced on that and there was 5 of us. So in the end we tried to pack in the car and the uber driver was like this canâ€™t happen so I jump out and said  Iâ€™ll just go home ( I didnâ€™t live to far from the club and wasnâ€™t too drunk) I got out and the car started to drive off and then out of no where one of TOMâ€™s friend jumped out and thought it was messed up for me to get an uber for everyone and not even take it. Tom and the people made it back to their destination. Out of no-where me and the friend that rode with me back to the same destination gets deleted from TOMâ€™s social media. I donâ€™t care, I ended up blocking him in return. His friend was like what did I do? I apologized for bring him in this mess even though I was just trying to be nice and be cautious about going home. Apparently, TOM was mad, stormed off as soon as they are arrived.\n\nAt this time his friends told me the truth (since he was gone) and everything that was wrong with me and him. I found out that TOMâ€™s friends are not trustworthy, they tend to â€œmess aroundâ€? with a lot people. I think I can say that TOM has insecurities because he thought I slept with his friends in the past. Tomâ€™s friends said I was too nice and tried to please TOM no matter what. Also, Tomâ€™s friends told him to take me seriously. Tomâ€™s friends said I was too honest which made things worse at times. \n\nThere was a reason why I wanted to wait till I was older to try to date and to experience things with someone I cared about. To show what type of person I am I had my first kiss when I was 18 and didnâ€™t get laid till well this relationship.\n\nItâ€™s just sad that I tried so hard to make this perfect.\n\nI know this was a lot, but I wanted to provide my thinking to each action I did. It was my first person I thought I loved. Hard lesson learned. As well I learned that age is just a number because TOM was immature for a 28yo. Lol, I tried to make this relationship happen and it damaged me pretty bad tbhâ€¦ through school, work, and my own life probs.\n\nI figured I was in the wrong because I got unfriended and what notâ€¦\n\nso AITA to ruin this relationship, take friends, idk?\n\nwhat do you think??",

She got over the relationship very quickly however,probably around a week or two after we broke up we were texting about feelings and stuff and she mentioned she basically had 0 romantic feelings for me anymore and that I shouldnâ€™t try and get my hopes up of ever getting back with her (this is because I did have and still do have strong feelings for her, she wasnâ€™t saying it to be an ass). \n\nThe problem is, shortly after the break up, she starts hanging around with this guy, who we will call A. She claims that A was a family friend from when she was younger, who didnâ€™t speak to her much during our relationship out of respect. However, she calls him her best friend, but never mentioned him or anything to do with him once in the time we were friends or during the relationship, only after. \n\nDuring our relationship, it definitely seemed as if I would always be the one to initiate anything, intimacy, dates, all of it. She didnâ€™t make to much of an effort to plan things or anything, and would often back out of things due to family stuff which I respected (she has had a rough upbringing so I respected these reasons). \n\nSince we broke up, she has been hanging with A a lot. Like nearly daily going out on drives, going out places to eat etc, none of which she really did with me. \n\nI asked her if they have feelings for each other since we agreed to be open with this sort of stuff shortly after breaking up and she insisted nothing was happening and that he was like a brother to her, but recently sheâ€™s admitted they now both have strong feelings for each other and she said she loves him and canâ€™t see herself with anybody else. Sheâ€™s barely talking to me anymore and is always talking to or is always with this guy, and is not making an effort with me whatsoever despite regarding me as one of her best friends.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for being suspicious that there might have been something going on between my ex and A while we were together?

            "input": "Now to start off, let me say that this isn't a post to get validation, I seriously want to know if I'm being an asshole, or at least, anything less than OK. It's also important to note that nobody has ever called me an asshole over this, it's just something that I myself am worried about.\n\nAnyway, I'm in love with my best (female) friend. I myself am male. During this story, which is still going on right now, we're around ages 16-20.\n\nI became friends with her because I had a crush on her. As soon as I felt it was socially appropriate, which was about 4-5 months into our friendship, I told her that. She said OK, but has basically dodged saying anything about reciprocation. Now, I'm not a dumbass, I know that \"not saying yes\" means \"no\". So I don't make any illusions of her being in love with me. She's basically trying to not hurt my feelings.\n\nHowever, despite this, I'm still in love with her. I don't have any issue with her avoiding the question, and I know that she, currently, isn't interested in a relationship (With anyone). Knowing this, I try to avoid bringing it up to much and try to just stay mostly friends. But I can't get rid of my love for her. I've told her this as well, or at least, I think it was clear from what I've said.\n\nThe big problem is that my wishes for the friendship and hers obviously don't align perfectly. I'd like to have way more contact with her than the other way around. Now, we've devised a situation that mostly works. We meet up at least once a year, possibly more if she wants. I email her every month. And she's 'required' to send me 2 emails per year. Now, when I say emails, these are big emails, usually being 1-3 pages, but I've sent one that was 8,25 pages long. A bit excessive, I know. Plus sometimes, there's some extra contact, like wishing each other a happy birthday, happy new year, all that jazz. \n\nAll in all, I'd say, on average, we meet up around 2 times a year and she emails me a couple of times a year, while I email her every month. This along with little titbits of contact along the way. She has assured me that this isn't something specific to me, and that this is just how she works. This has fluctuated along the years, but so far, the friendship has survived, even despite some (possibly major) issues. I'd obviously like more contact, but I try to respect her wishes.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not always the best at respecting her wishes and boundaries. Often times I get too excited or too depressed and start messaging her a bit too often. For example, while I can keep myself to 1 email per month the majority of the times, I'd say that in 1/3rd of all months, there would be another email. Sometimes, these weren't too big, like responding back to her when she responded, however, I don't think these emails were a real problem. The real problem emails were the ones I sent out of depression, loneliness, or whatever.\n\nI try to restrain myself from sending those emails, and in later times (As in, the last few months), I've been able to do so (Because I currently don't have anything that would lead to me sending those emails). However, previously, I haven't been so lucky. I went almost a whole year sending her 2 emails instead of 1, where I basically split up the month in 2 segments. Now, after she told me that she didn't like it, because it became too much for her, I stopped immediately. But I still did it for the previous few months, and that's something that I can't take back.\n\nThe even bigger problem however, weren't those emails. They weren't the emails I sent out of depression or other things. The emails I did send out of depression were pretty fucking bad. I'd try to always assure her that it wasn't her fault and that I'm merely venting to her about shit, but it basically became a negative feedback loop for myself. As I've said, currently, I've stopped doing so, and don't plan on doing it again, although I don't know if I'll be able to restrain myself from doing so when the going gets tough again.\n\nAnd currently, we've worked out most of these issues and our friendship still stands. We're prepared to face any new issues that might come our way, and the future looks bright. But my question is, was I an asshole for doing that to her in the past, or was it just a series of unfortunate events?",

She agreed to that and so we fully adopted that cat.\n\nIf my girlfriend went home for a holiday or something, I'll feed the cat and clean the litterbox, but otherwise my girlfriend took care of everything which was fine.\n\nRecently she wanted to foster ANOTHER cat, to which I said no we already have a cat and she would become attached to it.

My girlfriend is part of a group that takes care of feral cats in the city. She found this cat while it was basically on the brink of death.

She said that we would only be fostering him until his wounds healed and he was off his medication.\n\nAnyway, that was 4 months ago.

He keeps attacking her so we have to keep them separated and my girlfriend keeps trying to involve me more and more with the cats.\n\nOur original cat has grown on me but I'm not particularly fond of this new one because he keeps attacking our old one. I keep asking her when we're going to give him up, but it seems pretty apparent she has no intention of doing that.\n\nWe have to keep the cats separated, which usually means I need to bring our old cat into our office (where she basically lives now) so that the new one doesn't get cooped up in the spare bedroom.\n\nAnyway, I'm just tired of this shit. I felt bad for the cat which is why I eventually caved, but I do NOT want to adopt him. I honestly have no idea why my girlfriend got so attached and won't put him up for adoption. If he got along with our current cat I wouldn't care, but he doesn't and it has been FOUR MONTHS of trying to integrate them. It's clearly not going to work, but she won't stop trying.\n\nI basically bother her every night about when she's going to put him up for adoption or give him to a shelter and recently she's been getting pissy with me about how I can say something like that. It gets pretty close to the point of fighting and I just drop it because I don't care enough to get into a real argument about it, but it bothers me enough to vent about it here and check...\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of this cat?",

However, for context, let's start at the beginning.\n\nI introduced her to my boyfriend and they got along pretty well, I thought they were gonna be good friends and things would be good between the three of us. Then he moved around 6-ish months and we're now in a long distance relationship. After that, the red flags started to show up. \n\nShe started tellling me she was jealous of my relationship and that she had gotten romantic feelings for him, my boyfriend and I shut that down. She started talking with him on a practically daily basis, I ignored it because my boyfriend reassured me he was gonna shut down any advances she puts out towards him, and he has. \n\nThe big ones that make me think shit's going down is that she has made it a point to try to invite him to do stuff with her *alone*, ***multiple times*** while I was talking with both of them, I brought up all my concerns to her and she appologized, stating that she was offended I would think that about her. However, I truly believe that I cannot trust her because she has proven that to me through a couple of friends I'm close to that have talked with her, that she says one thing to me, and another thing to them.\n\nI guess I just want to ask if I'm an asshole for thinking there's something there when there might not be?",

I did get annoyed with how little they cleaned.  But there wasnâ€™t any problem until I told them that I didnâ€™t want a dog in the apartment. I was really vocal about not wanting a dog and within the week they came to me and told me that they wanted to move because I was messy and I didnâ€™t get along with them. I did the dishes and trash everyday, and was the only person consistently picking up the apartment. I will admit that they probably cleaned up after me three times total, in the entire semester that I lived with them. But itâ€™s not like I wasnâ€™t cleaning up after them almost every week either.\nWhen they found out that the housing policy would require them to pay almost 2k each to leave they dropped the subject and decided to stay. I was pissed at this point and decided to avoid being in the apartment as much as possible, and spent a lot of time studying on campus. I also made sure to never touch their messes to establish how little they do around the apartment.\nAfter having my roommates boyfriend of three days move in for the rest of the semester (who was like four years older than us, and cooked just to leave the pots and pans out for the entire day)  and pretty much having petty fights every two weeks I was pretty tired. After another scuffle, I decided to pick up a friends sublease, and dropped the 2k needed to leave and began to pack up my stuff without telling them. I bought the majority of the cleaning supplies and all of the bowls, plates silverware pots and pans so I knew they were going to be stuck without a kitchen with me leaving so unexpectedly. They came home mid-packing session, and they were mad enough to tell me that they were moving in a week, and told me how rude I was for leaving without notice. We fought over the next two days of me packing and leaving. I had to throw away one of my roommates moldy bathroom rugs during the semester, and after â€œher mom badgered her about itâ€? I ended up forking over 25$ for a bathroom rug that she said was okay to throw out.\nAfter officially checking out of my â€œroomâ€? I rented I got a call from my roommate accusing me of taking her collectible plastic cups, they were 8$ each and she was â€œ missingâ€? ten of them. She wanted me to pay 80$ for them. I genuinely thought that maybe I had grabbed them on accident, and after checking ALL of the stuff I packed I realized that the cups were probably back at the apartment. I tried to tell her I didnâ€™t have them and got into a screaming match with her over the phone. 30 minutes later my mom got a call from their parents claiming That I was going to be reported to campus police for stealing almost 100$ of their babies stuff and a bunch of other stuff I didnâ€™t do. Like sell weed out of the apartment, spent all my money on liquor, and forced my roommates to drive me and my drunk friends around. \n\nSo I ghosted them. The semester hasnâ€™t started yet, but Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m going to be taken to small claims court over plastic cups ",

He went to a fancy art school where he worked his ass off for his degree (went to community college first, worked the entire time he was at school, went to food closets, was homeless on and off living out of his car, ect). After we both graduated, we moved in together and I went to get my masters and he went to work in food service. He's been stuck on the idea that he HAS to do animation and hes just waiting for his big break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is. He sucks at it.\n\nHe hasn't even made an animation!\n\nYeah his school sucked so much, they didn't even have students make a demo reel. His story ideas are terrible, his artwork is terrible, and it feels like he's done nothing since graduating. I feel terrible for thinking this way and feel like a total asshole for trying to persuade him to seek another career path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Side:** He won't tell me why he wants to do animation specifically (not even the generic, \"I want to make an impact on the world\" kind of thing) and complains that the world is out to get him (often saying he suffers from \"bad luck\" or \"god hates me\" when I feel like it's his life choices hes making). He complains that the animation industry is cutthroat and works you to the bone and how awful it is. He also complains that art is so hard for him and his hand physically hurts when he even thinks about doing something creative. This all prompts me to say, \"If its so terrible and you complain about it so much.... well then why do you want to do it?\" and he goes on and on about how he wants to create a cartoon series and that he wants to put his degree to use. Or he comes up with a different disingenuous answer every time I ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, he started working part time so that he could work on his art more... but he hasn't really done much. He thought he could open commissions up to make some money on the side... but no one has even messaged him about it and its been months. He has no online following and complains about that too. I'm having to pay for a lot of things because he only makes enough to pay his bills and rent (I buy food, pay for any kind of date, pay for getting his car fixed, pay him for gas to get to work, ect). I honestly don't mind if he was happy but he hates this job too, and it sounds like it's not the right fit. He will not seek another job or pick up more hours because he thinks he is not qualified for anything outside food service and retail (not true), he doesn't want to do any more schooling or training for another career path, and he wants his next job to be an animation job and that's that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is also dead set on moving in with his former roommate that lives in LA (I really dislike him and think hes super sexist and a general man-child) so they can make their own TV show and pitch it to studios. Problem is, I think this friend is just as depressed and hasn't done shit either so I don't know how moving in with him would help. But he claims they have brilliant ideas (that I think are bad) and he needs to be in the same room to \"bounce ideas off each other.\" (Skype is out of the question apparently??)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is stressful for me because he won't say when he is going to move, wont make any plans for it, has no savings for it, and doesn't even know how long he will live out there (six months?? a year??? indefinitely????). I'm trying to find my own way in the world as well and it just feels like his ideas are just outlandish based on his skill. It's making it hard to move forward in life and make plans for the future together. We are close to our thirties now and while we are both the definition of late bloomers, I'm kind of tired of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am by no means a saint. I have had to change my career path and tried many different jobs out. I'm not doing a job that matches my degree. I've volunteered at a lot of different places and come at my career goals in non conventional ways. I've learned a lot from all of these experiences about what I want to do with my life. When he looks at jobs, if they aren't animation he wont even both applying. He's worked food service, retail, and that's it and only because he needed a paycheck. Never had an internship, never volunteered anywhere, nothing. I asked him if he would like to volunteer someplace now he's working part time and he said, \"no that will just take time away that I could be spending drawing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets very angry and stubborn with me if I mention pursuing a different career path, no matter how gently I say it, and it has been the basis for almost all of our fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**His side:** He often feels like I dislike his art and am not supportive of him. He says that these things take time and he is working on artwork and has made lots of progress. He also says he is applying for lots of jobs and he goes to (expensive!) animation conventions to network with people and recruiters for jobs. He spent $500 on an online skype tutoring course with a well known animator and really hit it off with the guy. He thinks that I just really don't get along with his old roommate and wishes that I did because then we could all move in together. LA is the place to be if you want to do animation and no other city would provide him as many opportunities. Me not supporting him is making things worse in his eyes and he wants me to be a supportive partner.  He blames the world around him and says his lack of money makes it hard to do anything. His computer is 4+years old now and makes it hard to even run photoshop on and that's why he doesn't like to animate or do art as much. He also says it takes him a long time to get his creativity flowing and it takes him too long to draw anything. If he just had more talent, he would have a job already (exact wording from him). He gets distracted while drawing and loses track of time (especially in the morning) making it hard to find time in the day to do anything productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe does suffer from depression and has since childhood. I had to push\\* him to go to therapy. He had a lot of negative experiences in the past and was on a crap load of medications that really messed with his affect. Since in therapy he's moved forward a bit, but his therapist is mostly about dealing with his stress and teaching meditation techniques. I also recently pushed him to get medical insurance and see a psychiatrist (and a doctor for the first time since dating). He got diagnosed with ADHD and is somewhat interested in pursuing medication, but is still hesitant because he \"doesn't want to become dependent on a pill.\" and, \"I've made it this far without medication, I don't want to lose the coping mechanisms I've learned to deal with it.\"\n\n\\*By push I mean looking up therapists/medical plans and basically laying it out for him or giving him a script of what to say on the phone when he chooses who to call. As with most things regarding his self care, it's a struggle to get him to do it but once he does he appreciates it and is thankful. I know you can't make anyone get help if they really don't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently looking into doing couples therapy with him.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe has many redeeming qualities (like being a wonderful supportive partner to me) and is such a smart brilliant person with so many skills. He's great at math, science, and all kinds of other subjects! But his determination and constant failure to get into the animation field have been a strain on our relationship. I feel like a huge asshole because instead of being supportive, I want to discourage him! When he draws me things or asks me to look at his latest work, I just feel upset because it's terrible and he won't get a job with his skills the way they are now.  I understand he is going through some heavy depression, but he's just so stubborn. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was very happy about buying our future home and although I wasn't too much looking forward to spend all my time working in the house, I was very positive about the whole situation, as my FIL offered his help. He has helped us before with stuff in our present flat and it always worked out decent.\n\nSo we bought the house and started with the usual...getting rid of the old stuff, ripping of wallpapers etc. And here is when the shit started. FIL and MIL got a key from my SO and started working without one of us being there. Sounds nice? Not for me. They decided about the stuff they did and I absolutly hated that they were doing it without us there. I tried to stop it the nice way like \"Hey, you musn't work here while we are not helping, let's do this later. \" but the did not get it. I asked my SO to make them stop, but he didn't. I told him, that this will lead to problems, but he shrugged it off. Here it is to mention, that he really, *really* adores his parents, they are the highest standard for him in whatever decision, a thinking I myself cannot understand, although Iam close to my father as well.\n\nIt went on...every decision we made was declined as \"impossible\" when it meant to do some more work to do. FIL only wanted to do less than absolutly necessary...e.g. not getting new electricity and so on. He would show me (and just me, as he is sure it is only me who does not want the stuff he tells) every damn socket to prove we do not have to change anything. We still did and his help got less.\n\nBut: Stuff still got worse, but just so lightly, that I can't even explain properly. My SO, who is a (sometime too) lovely and trusting person does not even notice most of the time. FIL just won't listen. Whenever I tell what we planned and have to do he would make it just the other way, driving me nuts.\n\nI know Iam not the most patiently person in the world and due to being very strict oftens many people cannot handle this. I feel sad for my SO having to deal with this, and he straight told me today when I asked him (again) to talk to his father that \"You are forcing me to do stuff I do not want to do.\" while he cannot understand that his parents are in my opinion incredible rude and even when they try to be helpful it is not helful in any way when we can never be sure if something will be made as we wish. And if I say \"we\" it is mostly me, as he will believe every damn word his father says, even if there is proof that it is as wrong as it can be.\n\nI told him to talk to his parents again. I cannot stand this anymore, Iam handling far more than I can, working a fulltime job and doing every single thing by myself, as I know that otherwise it will be done in a different way as wished. Additionally my SO has not the slightest idea how to renovate a house (neither have I, but Iam learning and reading stuff every night for many month by now) and he really sucks at crafting. Due to the high pressure Iam even less patient and we fight a lot, what is pretty uncommon for us. It sucks and I fucking hate it and the whole situation and I know that my bad mood is most responsible for our fights. I told him today again, that we need the help, that I would really appreciate his fathers help, but only if he does it as we wish with no exceptions. My SO does not want to do this. It might sound trivial, but the conflict in the whole situation is really strong and Iam even afraid for our future. So know Iam asking myself...\n\nAITA?",

I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?",

Normally we have a pretty good relationship and talk for a bit before switching. Usually its to vent on other coworkers who have causes us stress the last time we saw each other (usually the same people.) But today was different.\n\nToday they come into work and notice that another coworker who normally works in the back, is working out front where everyone can see. (Big lobby area, the guy has a stand out for a group today) and my coworker just starts railing on this dude. \"Oh god, fatso's out of the kitchen. I can't stand him.\" Now normally I understand - the dude is hard to get along with at work because he's head chef and is demanding of everyone he talks to. However when its not busy or when he is just hanging out (rarely) the guy has always been pleasant with me so in my mind: Pleasant dude/demanding when working. I can live with that.\n\nHowever I don't think my coworker has ever just chatted with the guy, except in work mode. And they are loudly complain about the chef working in the lobby today. Now the lobby's big, he probably can't hear them talk but they are making no effort to conceal it. In fact they're going on and on so much I only get a chance to say one sentence- \"I think you're overstepping.\"\n\nThey shut up. Like on the spot. Now normally they are chatty no matter what but this was an instant shift. They didn't talk to me besides \"Yes, No,\" or \"okay\" until I packed up and left. Reeeaaally different from any other interaction with them. Personally I'm thankful in case chef was going to overhear at some point later in the day when I wasn't there.\n\nTLDR: Coworker was complaining loudly about fellow coworker who was working in the same room (probably couldn't hear at the time) and I told them they were overstepping without explaining myself. Coworker got visibly upset with me and refused to talk to me till I left.\n\nSo specifically- AITA for the way I spoke? WITA for not properly conveying why I disagreed, seeing as I only said one sentence? (But it worked)",

Few days ago, police show up at the house to arrest him on outstanding warrants, child neglect, and lots of other stuff. He ran back inside the house after announcing he was going to get a gun. He was shot by police and later died at the hospital.\n\nAnyways, this guy used to live with my family growing up. He was a criminal from a very young age. He stole hundreds of dollars from my parents including electronics.  When he lived with us, he did mean things to me (I was around 12 at the time.) I would be afraid to sleep because he would put random objects like erasers, paperclips, pencils, even food in my mouth. I would wake up with this stuff in my mouth. Always surprised I never choked on it. There were other incidents where he would barge into the bathroom while I was using it and would proceed to laugh and make fun of me.\n\nI never told my parents because to them, kids always lie and make stuff up (my sister used to make shit up all the time so therefore we were all liars.) So I always kept quiet about it. Well I recently told my parents what went on and they both gave me this super shocked look like I was making it up. My mom thinks I should be sympathetic towards the man's death but I honestly feel nothing. I told her that I didn't think people deserved to be shot, but his death wasn't a surprise to me. \n\nI also don't have much to do with my brother as he is a criminal himself. Mom is upset I refuse to console or talk to him about it. I don't allow him to have my phone number because he can get pretty annoying (asking for money, stuff, etc.) He's been asking my parents for my number and I will be pretty upset if they give it out.

She has accused my dad of cheating, yelled at random women for sleeping with him in public with no proof, and even threatened to throw acid at a woman receiving financial help from my dad since they live in a third world country and insulin is too expensive to purchase for their 8 year old diabetic son. My father has left many times throughout my childhood only to return a day later because he knew that if he left, I'd become homeless with my mother. \n\nThree nights ago, my father decided he had enough and left her for good. This means, that somebody needs to cover the rent - and I warned her since he left that she would have to find housing since playing the rent would require a roommate and said roommate would most likely refuse to house my mother rent free. She barely acknowledged my warning - muttering under her breath or changing the subject by flipping the script and saying that she couldn't believe her own daughter was kicking her out (I am in my 20s by the way). \n\n I managed to find a roommate that has taken a tour of the place and agreed to move in AND PAY HIS PORTION OF THE RENT! I updated my mom on the news and informed her that he would be moving in by the end of the month - meaning she has until then to pack up and leave. \n\nAlso, the whole time this has been happening I've been recommending to her to talk to my brother who is a single father with two kids and a demanding full time job to talk to him about moving in since she babysits his kids 6 out of 7 days anyway. He's in the middle of a custody battle too so my father and I agree that her moving in would be beneficial to both of them. \n\nSome quick notes to add more context: \n\n- I have a dog so finding an apartment is harder. \n- I live in NYC so finding a 2 Bdrm that accepts dogs and is in my budget makes it even harder. \n- The rent at my current apartment is way below my budget.\n\nIt's a tough situation so I really don't know if I'm being the asshole or not.

He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. ",

The need of human resources is extremely high, so I took the job at a cinema at the checking post as my part time. Note that I work full time at Lotte Mart (a shopping center similar to Walmart) at the receiving dept. My full time job is very time-consuming and exhausting, as we often have containers of goods coming in and out, and there are only 5 staffs in my department, 2 of which only deal with papers and one is our supervisor, which means he rarely gets involved in the receiving process. Me being constantly exhauted is inevitable.\n\nTherefore, when it came to my part time job, I have stated very clearly to my manager that I could only stay for an extra of 15 to 20 minutes at max, partly because I needed rest and partly because my place was about 30 minutes away from the cinema. She was ok with it at first.\n\nBut things didn't go well. She constantly asked me to stay extra time to clean things up, although she has 5 or 6 staffs (who work full time) AND floor janitors to do so. I declined her politely every time, but I always clean up my post spotless before taking my payment and leaving, which also took me 5 to 10 minutes. She wasn't happy with it and insisted that I work overtime or she would pay me nothing. When I asked her if I was going to be paid for my extra time, she said it was my \"contribution to the cinema for being very generous\". I was paid 15$ for a 3 hours shift (which is reasonable considering our standard) and because of that she forced me to work 1 more hour \"to match my payment\". I'm like \"screw you, I'm done\" about a week after. She then told her staffs (one of them told me later) that I was \"asky, selfish and lazy\", and claim my work to be \"not worthy of what I was paid\", although I haven't heard a single complain from my customers.\n\nTell me, what would you do if you were in my shoes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",

I get really offended when I feel my ex-gf continues to disrespect me when the first thing she does when arriving back in my city is call me up to get access to drugs for herself and her casual sex friend. AITA for getting angry at her and telling her off?\n\n(Disclaimer - I'm not in the hardcore drug crowd, and neither was she before this)\n\n(Disclaimer 2 - This was a 3 year relationship, so not insignificant considering we are both in our 20's)\n\n(Disclaimer 3 - we both suffer from some form of perfectionism and intermittent depression issues. I also have a few anxiety issues from the perfectionism. Both of us intermittently see psychologists to manage this during our lives)\n\n**Background story**\n\nSo my ex gf and I break up last year. Combination of factors including the  relationship turning long distance, but despite some ugly moments in  the break-up we have intermittent contact, mainly because we have good  understanding of each other. We are both perfectionists, both have high  expectations of ourselves, high drive to try to succeed in our careers,   are both blunt but introverted, despite being both socially amicable.  etc etc - We have good interpersonal chemistry that we both enjoy.\n\nMy personal reason for the break up was the unequal treatment I felt being  with her. Despite being a perfectionist, I was only perfectionist with myself, and I generally didn't judge my ex gf's negative traits. These traits included some pretty toxic behaviors, including threatening  suicide to get attention (according to her psychologist), undermining me  emotionally when arguing eg. name calling, playing on personal fears  (e.g. you will never be successful). She would in general be  hyper-critical, and especially when she was upset she would not care at  all what she said, regardless of how hurtful or damaging it was.\n\nI  tried to over-looked some of her extreme behavior because I deeply  enjoyed her company in other areas. She was highly motivated, and we  were pro-active together in our lives. I had endless conversations with her, and in general we tried to support each others personal development. We shared the burden of each others degree together. She was the person that got me out of my post-graduation funk  and got my ass moving towards actually getting my career going. We even built a little micro-business together.\n\nDespite her intense nature I deeply respected her for these positive traits. I even somewhat admired her for her dedication to improve herself. She was  constantly working extra-curricular activities to further her  experience, and I deeply loved that energy she had.\n\nBut over-time, I generally began to resent, what I saw as a lack of  personal respect for me. She would often be incredibly harsh and unsupportive of my emotional problems that came with perfectionism and  anxiety, my struggle with employment while studying my masters, my  procrastination that came from perfectionism and distaste of not doing a  good job in my assessment. She was incredibly disrespectful to me personal struggles with anxiety and perfectionism while all the time I  never once judged her for her own emotional and mental problems even though I clearly could have.\n\nI  do get some emotional closure for my feelings after 6 months of break-up, as she messages, apologizes and says she feels she was really harsh and unfair  to me in our relationship, and basically feels terrible that she treated me the way she did. This resolves some of my festering emotions and I more or less try to let go of my hurt feelings and move on with my life. \n\n**The lead up to incident**\n\nWe've been talking intermittently about our lives every few months since the break-up, and she's been getting into drinking, and from what I can  gather, a few hard drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. Her life seems to in general  have become more extreme over time. She has become a stripper over the semester break because she said she \"wanted to get a thicker skin and toughen up\".\n\nSo fast-forward to early December, 8 months after break-up, and she's coming back to my  city to gather some personal belongings she has left at my place for the  last 8 months, and we've agreed to meet up on the day she arrives and have dinner. The day before she gets to my city we have one last phone  conversation. The conversation swings wildly from her sending me  potential career jobs in her city that she thinks would be good for me,  some encouragement for doing a blog that I was thinking of starting, and offering to help me out with a struggle I was having with my current  academic dispute i was having with my university....\n\nThis  shifts to her own problems, which include opening up that she  is really upset because she was kicked from one of her stripping  contracts, because she went, took cocaine, and had a foursome with a  wealthy casual sex friend she has been dating, who happened to be  visiting her in the strip club, whom the cameras caught her leaving  with.\n\nAt the end of this conversation during the goodbye, she then also tells me that she loves me???????\n\nThis  conversation both confuses and upsets me. It feels wrong for her to be  over-sharing sharing these weird sexual things with me, I understand she  is having a rough time, but I can't be there for her in this capacity,  especially in the same breadth as telling me she loves me. I don't know what to say, so I just say bye. \n\n**The Incident**\n\nOn  the day she gets to my city, I text her at 6pm, and she's already  drunk. She tells me that she is now staying at the Hilton hotel for a  few days instead of staying for one day as she previously told me, as  she's decided to come with her rich casual sex buddy on a whim, for a conference he is going to in my city. Without so much as a hello how are you, she begins asking me if I know anyone that can get her and her (sex) friend  some cocaine. I say I can't. She then asks me if I have any MDMA (think  ecstasy)  she can have. I can't respond anymore because I'm with a  friend.\n\nShe texts an hour later and asks  again \"so can we have it\", thinking I have these imaginary drugs for her. The expectancy is kind of annoying me. I say don't have any drugs, or know anyone at the moment except  for marijuana. Finally she says they want to buy all the weed I have on me if I want to sell them it.\n\nAt this  point I'm pretty pissed, like she hasn't seen me in months and the first  thing she does is want to use me to get drugs. This feels incredibly disrespectful to me as a person, like I'm some nobody drug dealer she is calling to get a fix,  but also as a former partner, as it's asking me to be involved  and in some way facilitating her fuck buddy, without considering how  inappropriate or uncomfortable that might be for an ex. Like what am I  supposed to do? Drive into the city in the middle of the night, make a  impersonal transaction of weed to her and some fuck buddy, and then just fuck off like some random drug dealer?\n\nI'm  immediately enraged by her for putting me in this trashy and low value  position with her. It brings up all the emotions I felt for how  disrespectful she was to me in the past, ripping open all these old  wounds. In my anger I basically tell her she's basically become the low  value whore she's always wanted to be, how uncool it is that she's  immediately just asked me for drugs and that's it, and how fucked up and  reckless her current life choices have been leading up to this point.   It's like all the poison that she had given to me over the years, all the nasty stuff that I had to endure or tolerate suddenly came out of  me, and I just lashed out in disgust.\n\nShe  doesn't even understand why I'm upset. She starts associating it with  jealousy, or emotions, saying that we are no longer together, and that  she would like me to not judge her for her life choices and just be good  friends. But I'm too angry, I'm too hurt to even think calmly anymore. I  tell her how messed up her current life choices have been in getting  her to this point and that I don't want to know anymore about what  messed up, reckless behavior she is doing.\n\nShe essentially tells me \"Fine. Fuck off\", and blocks me on every social media outlet we share. \n\nI'm honestly infuriated the it seems so blind to her how not ok this must seem. Am I the asshole here for getting upset at her requests?\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI honestly just want to know, am I the asshole here? I know I didn't handle the situation well, but were my feelings on this issue warranted? Was I actually just being unreasonable and her request was normal for someone into drugs? Is this just me struggling to let go of old baggage and I overreacted?",

I have a few friends from my student government class, but thatâ€™s about it. I do have a couple home schooled friends too that I met playing online video games.\n\nAnyways, over the past few months I have heard some of my friends making plans to do various things together like get lunch, go to movies, just hang out, etc. After Iâ€™d seen them do this in front of me without an invite, I decided to ask the girl who usually plans these things, who Iâ€™ll call Betty. Betty said that I wasnâ€™t that much fun to hang out with because I'm too awkward to talk to. Ouch.\n\nOnce they know my feelings are hurt, Betty just starts to do it even more frequently. Well one day at lunch, my homeschool friends call me and ask if I want to go get tacos with them. We plan it out on the phone, right in front of my friends. Betty then says that Iâ€™m rude for planning so do something without her, and that just for that, I wouldnâ€™t be invited for the next few times they hang out.\n\nAt this point, Iâ€™m upset. Iâ€™m hindsight, I couldâ€™ve just walked away while I was on the phone but that isnâ€™t the point. After that though, I just decided that I would not be hanging out with those kids outside of school and just chill with my homeschooled friends because the are the only ones who like having me around.\n\nNow Betty is calling me a bad friend for not wanting to hang out with them at the few things Iâ€™ve gotten invited to. \n\nSorry for the long read, but Am I The Asshole here?",

Only two of us live in the same house as my mother, who was recently diagnosed with heart problems and also likely has glaucoma.

They guilt tripped me about how bad they would feel if something were to happen to me, and said other things to try to make me reconsider my decisions. I could transfer to the main campus of my state school like my original plan was when I started college, but if I have the opportunity to go to a school like Harvard or Stanford, I believe that I should take it.

I feel the need to do something different, other than the usual process of smoking and drinking and waking up with a hangover. I needed something different. Rather than camp in the local forest or play dungeons and dragons, I decide I really want to do some LSD with my friends. I make some calls and found a supplier and four of my closest friends to join me in my trip. This is where the trouble begins. \n\nWe arrive at the dealerâ€™s dorm, weâ€™ll call him S. Heâ€™s a pretty charismatic guy, and no lie Iâ€™m immediately jealous of his handsomeness and ability to talk, and it doesnâ€™t help that one of my friends whom I have a bit of a crush on (letâ€™s call her M) was taken with him immediately, so I was a bit jealous. Not only that, but I find myself incredibly uncomfortable around him as soon as we meet. Iâ€™m autistic and socially anxious so I donâ€™t think anything of it. Iâ€™m used to ignoring my instincts about people. \n\nS had initially said that we would be getting sugar cubes with liquid L dropped on them, but in his room he says heâ€™ll drop it directly on our tongues and we oblige. Iâ€™m only looking for one hit but when itâ€™s my turn he gives me two before I can really react. I just laugh it off. The rest of our party takes the dose (one person taking it in the eye, letâ€™s call her H). We chill in his room and chat while we wait for it to kick in, and S offers everyone some dabs, which my friends take. \n\nEventually the acid hits us and our trips are starting up. We go down to one of our partyâ€™s room, letâ€™s call him J, and start watching a movie. Everyone joins, including S, who is a few years older than the rest of us and a first-semester student at our school. Eventually, we decide to go walk to a swing on campus, everyone but S and M.\n\nWe leave, me, J, another friend weâ€™ll call C, and another weâ€™ll call Z. J and C are tripping with me, Z is drunk and high. H stays with S and M but leaves after me, Z, J, and C. S and M are in Jâ€™s room alone. \n\nAfter a while me and C realize thereâ€™s a problem here, but we canâ€™t quite focus on it because we were tripping deep. We try to get back to the room but donâ€™t rush because Z and J left for it ahead of us. We call M. S asked her up to his room. It is important to note that at this point we realized that S had not dropped with us. He was stone cold sober the entire time. \n\nMe and C return to Sâ€™s room. M is sitting on the bed and S is sitting in front of his tv, talking about a movie called â€œFreaksâ€? in which circus freaks with, and I quote, â€œfreaks with disabilities and mental illnesses form an alliance and beat the bad guy.â€? I know I was tripping then, but I saw a copy of our school newspaper on his desk, the one in which my senior project, a Hidden Disabilities Alliance/ support group, was written about. M tells me later that S has brought that movie up because one of the characters crawls out of a door, like she was when she tried to leave his room. \n\nWe sit there for a bit. H returns, M goes out to get a cigarette, and S begins to seem agitated. He starts making cracks at me and C (J is bad tripping and Z is helping him), and eventually he takes out a glass pipe. He tells us itâ€™s DMT, and that someone is going to hit it. I tell him heâ€™s the only sober one, but he keeps pushing it. I get my backpack (S: â€œGoing to class there buddy?â€?) and leave. C and H follow me. \n\nI go to M and tell her we need to leave. She smiling so much, sheâ€™s loving this right now. Apparently they were having a great conversation. I tell her that S had tried to push DMT on us, and she flies to the door and says she wants to do DMT. This is where I fuck up. M has a history of sexual assault. She is currently trying to decide what to do about it legally. I tell her S was giving me a bad vibe. She asks what I mean. I canâ€™t remember if it was me or C who first said S was â€œrapey,â€? but one of us does, and that sends M into a PTSD attack for the rest of her trip- about 6-7 hours. \n\nWe donâ€™t see S again, and we salvage the situation a bit, but she was upset at me, and rightfully so. Everyone eventually meets up and we go to the mountains to watch the sunrise when we all came down. \n\nTLDR: Got acid from a sketchy guy, tried to prevent a possibly bad situation, sent my best friend on a PTSD attack while tripping.

I can understand the jealousy in there, that's not the issue here. I became closer friends with his girlfriend, closer than he was to her apparently. This made him angry. After a while she broke up with him and he blamed me for it. He started being hurtful to her, saying things like \"I wish you still loved me so I could hurt you\" and making jokes about having sex with her with an unsavory character, basically in front of her face. But she's my friend, and if he's going to start attacking her like that, I'm going to side with her.  But I have no intention of anything other than friends with her. She has another boyfriend now, and I'm happy for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time that this was happening, I was talking to a different girl. He started getting close to her when difficulties sprang up, so I felt like he was taking advantage of the situation. After what felt like forever to me, I fell out with this girl with much pain and grief involved. But he continued getting close to her, even after his girlfriend broke up with him. Understandably I was very angry about this, I felt hurt and betrayed, and yes, jealousy is a factor here. I never went as far as he did though, to make cruel jokes at her expense and to threaten her. I don't care about her anymore, I'm over it. \n\nRecently, they started dating.\n\nI shouldn't care, I shouldn't have an issue with it. I don't even talk to her anymore. But the fact that he's still close to someone who hurt me makes me irritable and angry. I can barely stand his presence, his voice annoys me wherever I hear it, and he seems to be a leech on a group of friends, along with this unsavory character I mentioned earlier. Needless to say we aren't friends anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I have 2 grudges here.

I thought to myself, â€œhmm, wonder what this could be all about.â€?\n\nFirst, let me preface this by saying that I rarely ever use FB or their messenger app (otherwise I couldnâ€™t spend so much time on Reddit). So I open the app and read what my cousin posted. My cousinâ€™s 7 year old daughter was doing a fundraiser for heart health sponsored through her elementary school trying to raise $250 dollars. \n\nUnfortunately thatâ€™s not all my cousin decided to post on her wall. On the link she called out myself and numerous members of my family and tagged them for not donating to her daughterâ€™s fundraiser, â€œespecially considering the history of heart disease that runs in our family.â€? \n\nAfter reading this I felt blindsided. I know for a fact I had no knowledge of this fundraiser because (a) I donâ€™t use FB, and (b) she never once messaged any of us directly asking for help (which every member of my household said they wouldâ€™ve gladly contributed to had she done so).  The only thing she ever posted was a general link that all her friends could see, no tags. Nothing less than two weeks ago. Nobody had any idea that this was a thing but apparently we were supposed to know about everything my cousin posts (which is quite a lot).\n\nSo today she commented to my aunt (her mother), again on FB and for the whole world to see, that she cannot trust family to help out, and that she expected differently from her family. So I decided to message her to talk about this issue and clear the air. I explained how I felt blindsided and that all she needed to do was message me. Her response was that she tagged all of us so she wouldnâ€™t look like she was singling anyone out. I did my best trying to be the adult between us (sheâ€™s in her forties and Iâ€™m 27). But even after carefully explaining how this made me feel and how I wish she wouldâ€™ve approached the situation she just told me â€œwill do.â€?\n\nThe thing is, Iâ€™m now considering not donating to my little cousin because of her mother but I feel terrible. Sheâ€™s just a kid and she shouldnâ€™t be punished for her motherâ€™s actions, especially considering what sheâ€™s raising money for. Even still, Iâ€™m pissed and really donâ€™t want to give them a dime because I truly believe my cousin should understand that her words carry consequences and Iâ€™m afraid contributing will only reinforce her belief that shaming her family is the way to getting what she wants.

Might be I have to apologize or stand up for myself, I donâ€™t know and need your help.\n\nPlease observe English is not my first language.\n\nFirst thing to know is that my boyfriend and I both have our own struggles. I have bipolar disorder and highly functional autism, and he is dealing with antisocial personality disorder. \n\nWe are both independent adults at good points of our lives and we try to not affect each other with our own â€œmentalâ€? struggles, weâ€™re both too sensitive for that and having a healthy relationship (for once) is definitely the goal.\n\nOf course, struggling as we are, we constantly have bad moments and deal with them very differently. As heâ€™s antisocial, heâ€™ll isolate himself, sometimes for weeks. This was difficult for me at first as Iâ€™m afraid of rejection, but after nearly 2 years together, Iâ€™ve realized this is the BEST solution as he gets hostile (never aggressive) during these periods and it is actually worse to be around him than to be  â€œabandonedâ€?, as heâ€™s always come back so far.\n\nNow, whenever he gets anxious, I know that whatâ€™s best for him is that I leave, before he has to tell me. Itâ€™s not fun for me, but I do it for him, because I love him and I want him to feel better.\n\nI have a strange relationship with both my parents and am rather dependent on people around me as a consequence of this and my autism. I try hard to change this though, especially with him, and feel that Iâ€™ve done good work. But sometimes I just need him.\n\nThis happened today at the restaurant. I mentioned that I have highly functional autism and while Iâ€™m capable of living independently, I am sound and light sensitive and can get anxious in social situations. Especially if they are unusual and I havenâ€™t â€œpracticedâ€? this social situation before.\n\nToday we were going to have lunch together and the waiter was walking around close to us, making strange singing noises that made me anxious. I am also recovering from a flu and didnâ€™t feel good from walking in the cold.\n\nThe food came and my potatoes were undercooked. All these things together made me upset and I struggled to keep it cool and needed him to be on my side and help me fix what can be fixed of the situation. \n\nHe didnâ€™t. He told me that â€œI wonâ€™t this timeâ€?. Why? I donâ€™t know. Maybe I was being too difficult. But I tried not to make a scene. I just told him that Iâ€™m tired of always coming to the conclusion that I care more about him than he cares about me. I told him I didnâ€™t want him to come back to my place with me, and that I wanted to go home.\n\nHe told me to leave. I did, upset but not too dramatically.\n\nI went home and cried a lot. He came back later to pick some stuff up before he went home. I noticed later that he left the food I ordered (minus the potatoes that made me lose it) in a doggy bag on my table.\n\nNow Iâ€™m a bit torn. I know I overreacted, but I tend to do, and so does he. When he does, I adapt to him. When I do... he still expects me to adapt to him? I canâ€™t just stop being anxious any easier than he can, and he always uses this as an excuse.\n\nI know heâ€™s antisocial and sometimes he frankly doesnâ€™t care about me. This doesnâ€™t make him bad. But it also means that Iâ€™m not bad for being dependent at times and needing him.\n\nAm I the asshole in this shit show?\n\nThanks to anyone sharing their point of view, I just want to add that I have no intentions of speaking badly about my boyfriend and I appreciate if everyone can be considerate of the struggles we both have.\n",

We had been together for 10 years and she walked out of our home the night she admitted her affair to me and left. This blindsided me so it's been pretty rough for me to accept, I was hoping she would at least try some marriage counselling or try and figure out what went wrong before I made a decision on if we should part ways but she wasn't interested and basically told me in no uncertain terms we would never get back together and to give up any hope of that. She is still with this guy today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo around this time last year, before the cheating was revealed, 2 of our closer friends invited us to their wedding, my wife is best friends with the Bride I was invited to be a Groomsman by the Groom and happily accepted. When we first broke up, I was talking to the Groom and pointed out that the wedding was going to be an issue, in my experience the bridal party are introduced to a song (we had picked our wedding song), dance together etc. He agreed and said he would actually understand if I couldn't go, but that I should definitely go to his bucksâ€“a week long overseas trip. In January the Bride had her birthday and didn't invite me or mention anything, which kind of hurt. I put that aside and went to the bucks recently, had a good time with the buck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the weekend it was time to RSVP for the wedding and I'd been changing my mind back and forth often and thought maybe it was best if I avoided it all-together. The few times I've seen my ex when she has come to our house to pack her things, take the dog etc, I've found it really difficult to be around her so I've been avoiding any contact and removed her from social media to try and focus on moving on. I tried to call the groom to ask if my ex would be bringing her affair partner and to see what expectations there are for the bridal party. He didn't answer his phone so I sent a message basically saying that I regrettably won't be attending because of the situation with my ex-wife. In hindsight I probably should have kept trying to call him but I was really anxious about the call in the first place and just wanted it to be dealt with so I could try and relax. I haven't got a reply from him in 24 hours and I've tried to ring him several times today but he isn't answering, which is a bit unusual for him. I just wanted to say that maybe I panicked a bit sending the text message off and perhaps I could go to the ceremony as a regular non bridal party member and that would make things a bit more bearable for me in terms of being around my ex-wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel awful about it, I thought he would understand but maybe after all this time he forgot that he said he would understand if I didn't come, or figured I would've said something sooner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here or am I overthinking this?

My birthday is in 2004 so I will only be 15 later this year (keep this in mind because the girl in the story is only about 3 months older than me). \n\nMy brother is going to 19 somewhat soon (some time in march). I've never really had a good relationship with him. We argue almost everyday over the smallest things (Side note: I suspect he has autism/tourettes as he gets random bursts of anger and he has always been the \"special\" kid - YES I have tried explaining this to my mom but shes such a softie and expects everyone to ignore how badly he treats us because \"he's special\".)\n\nAnyways on to the relevant shit - remember the girl I mentioned earlier? Let's call her Jasmine. Now back in 2016 my brother and myself used to attend a youth service (I no longer go due to changed views but that's not important) where we met Jasmine, at that time she was attending the same Primary school as I was but I was only just starting to get to know her. She was also a bit of an \"odd\" person but I dont judge - we even became quite good friends. Fast forward about early 2018, Jasmine moves to a different town 15 minutes away after she's held back a year (so now shes my age but one grade behind). \n\nJasmine and I sort of drifted apart and I thought she was out of my life. Recently she suddenly started posting on her WhatsApp status out of nowhere, since I hadn't seen her online in over 2 months. These posts were all random deep and edgy quotes but amongst one of the slides was a picture of her and my brother in his room on his bed and they're all cuddled up and shit. My stomach honestly dropped and I just felt really sick to my stomach. It had to have been recently because 1. we moved into a new house and his walls are a bright colour so I could obviously see it was our new house and 2. he had recently dyed his hair which you could see in the image. \n\nI never remember her being invited to our house so I suspect he snuck her in which makes me even more ill.. I just cant believe he could do that. Everytime I look at a guy older than 17 I immediately associate it with my brother and am no longer interested. I'm honestly just really creeped out.\n\nSo in conclusion: Should I tell my mom? Or should I leave it because it's none of my business? I'm just super conflicted and could use some advice.",

I also suffered from bullying that ranged from verbal abuse to hardcore wedgies on a daily basis. I went into a deep depression and even though my parents always intended to give me the best trips, clothes and experiences possible, I felt empty inside and even got to the point where I wanted to end my life.\n\nIâ€™ve come a long way by myself emotionally and a little bit longer than 7 months ago I got my first GF (who for the sake of privacy weâ€™ll call Kayla). Kayla has always had my back and has been supportive of everything Iâ€™ve done. My dad on the other hand has been the complete opposite, he has always wanted something different from me, heâ€™s always looked at the way I look and present myself as instead of how I feel and what I like.\n\nI met Kayla at a national academic tournament, she lives 300 miles away from me, and my dad doesnâ€™t like that a single bit. A few days ago he blew up and called everything I like and love (soccer and Kayla mainly) a bunch of literal bs that isnâ€™t right for me.\nHonestly I feel like itâ€™s been several years where I feel rejected by my own dad.

For the last few years my brother has been complaining to his wife and my parents that he, our kids, and I don't spend enough time together. In the last three or four years, he has invited me to one event outside of his home, birthday parties, block parties, and New Year celebrations, all of which I have attended. In that time, I've invited him to an annual convention that he did attend three times, birthday parties that he didn't attend, and a few other random things he passed on. Now, events aside, the only other relevant information is that my nephew has very flat feet and needs special inserts to walk for long periods of time. I hope that is enough back story and presented without bias.\n\nTwo months ago, I purchased tickets for my brother, his son, my son, and myself to attend the annual convention. When I let my brother know, he said he was on board and that was pretty much it until a day before the convention. At that time, I texted him to ask how he wanted to handle travel to the venue. He said he didn't really care and it was my choice. As his son was staying the weekend with my father, I suggested he pick us up at 11 am the day of the convention. Initially, he provided a simple agreement, but a few hours later he messages me letting me know that his son misplaced one of his inserts earlier in the week and walking for a long time was going to be an issue for him. As such, they probably weren't going to make it through the whole convention and we might want to take separate vehicles so my son and I can finish the convention if they have to leave. I thought about it for a few hours and informed him that I agreed and, while I was hopeful they would make it through, believed it would be best if we took separate cars and we could meet at the entrance to the convention. He responded with (not verbatim), \"Well, I still have to pick up \\[my son\\] from, dad's, so I guess I'll text you when I get there.\" I replied questioning why my nephew wouldn't just ride with me and he answered, \"Because I'm picking him up. Thanks anyway.\" My first instinct was to ask him what his problem was, but I said, \"You're welcome. We'll see you there. Love you,\" and left it alone.\n\nTo shorten an already long story, my brother informed my dad to not let my nephew go anywhere with me, told my father he doesn't want to be a part-time family member (not sure what that specifically means here), had his wife pick up his son, and never did attend the convention. I haven't heard anything from him since.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to have my son's and my time at the convention potentially cut short by my nephew's physical limitation and agreeing to take two cars after it was suggested?",

            "input": "Six years ago my friend started a company. He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?",

Initially it was just supposed to be us 2. But as time went on and we were unable to find time to get away we missed the opportunity 2 Winters in a row. \n\nWord about the cabin got out to my wife's family and they expressed interest in possibly joining us if we ever decided to, or found the time, to go. \n\nI was fine with this. It was just me and her and her parents. Then her sister and nephew were added to the discussion without really asking me. But I was still okay with it because I love her family and we all get along well. \n\nSo we found a weekend to go and everything was looking fine. Then I find out that my wife's niece was also invited without asking me. I grit my teeth a bit simply because I wasn't consulted about it but in the end I was still okay with it. \n\nNow this trip has transformed from something that was just supposed to be my wife and I into her family trip to my family cabin.

It's not like she's bringing a bunch of people you don't know.

But I explained that it happens frequently and it just doesn't feel great when it's all the time.\n\nIt escalated quickly into an argument.

            "input": "Okay so there's quite a bit to this story but I'll try my best to explain it as neutral and equal as possible. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half now and it's been a bumpy road pretty much the whole time. We met 3 years ago but kept it casual for a long time as I didn't feel ready for a relationship due to trust issues on my end which I was very up front about to her,  I'd say that we are still in love but it's definitely a very distant love where neither of us can talk to each other about anything (all this leads up to my main point.) Our sex life has been getting worse and worse over the months and has always been quite dry compared to what I like which has always made distance between us as I see it as an important part of a healthy relationship which she disagrees with. There's much more but I'll get to the main point.\n\nEND OF THE BRIEF BACK STORY\n\nSo this has been something I've been doing quite recently where she'll either go somewhere or listen to a certain person that I think is quite honestly stupid and without logic. For example she works in a mostly female work force so there's a lot of bitching and people making up things about others which she has been caught on the middle of as of now. 2 specific girls started lying and picking on her friend and actually made a complaint to the boss about the lies they'd made up about my girlfriend and her friend. This has caused my girlfriend a lot of stress so obviously being her boyfriend I've told her to stop getting involved with girls like that as they are just causing her stress and making her miserable at home which she just shruggs off ebeb though she told me that it makes her feel that way. Fast forward to a couple of nights ago when one of those girls lying about her texts her asking to meet up at 11:30PM basically crying for attention hecause no else will come out and even though all the shit she made my girl feel and all the lies she made up about her, my girl goes to meet up eith her and be a shoulder to cry on which I obviously question and say that shes playing you and just making a fool out of you. Then she says that its \"my choice what I do and you shouldn't question me.\" This made me confused as I thought it seemed like common sense to not go but obviously I was wrong as I spoke my concern about what she'll say and maybe even start a fight to which my girl just shrugged her shoulders and left. Another example was a night when she was just going out with some friends to a bar which I was completely fine with until it got to about 1:30 in the morning which was odd because she had work the next day. I tried calling her to check up and she didn't answer after another few times of calling which got me worried because I didn't hear from her since 5PM that evening and I had no idea where she could be or if she was safe. An hour and a half passes and I get a call from her saying she's on her way back to which I respond with telling her of the worry I was in and how scared it had made me. She tells me that she was going to come back earlier but one of the guys in her group had just gone through a break up so she was trying to give advice and help talk to him for the past couple of hours which made me flip my shit as she knows of the distressing past mental abuse I suffered from other relationships and the trust issues I face every day. I've told her about these things so she understands my thought process and how I put things together in my head. However it didn't occur to her that I'd be pissed about her fixing another boys issues while simultaneously causing more for me by not even sending a single message saying what time she'll be back or if she was even alive. I critized how she thought that was okay and how she would think I wouldn't worry with the issues I've told her about time and time again. There are more instances of similar situations but you get the image, I'm not saying that any of this isn't my faults because I do believe it's my fault but I definitely don't think I'm an asshole with how open I've been about her about these issues and that it will affect the relationship.\n\nIn short: AITA for being annoyed about said situations and questions her mental logic to do certain things that she knows won't end well or are just letting her get used by others?",

I don't know what their reasoning behind trying to stop me was, but I don't believe they were in any way a threat looking back - my front door was less than 12 feet from them and they made no attempt to follow me or anything like that - but my instincts say that offending a random stranger is less important than preserving my own safety. That said, I did spend the rest of the night feeling bad, and the feeling stuck with me through to this morning.\n\nSo thoughts? Am I right to feel bad, or was this just a sensible call on my part?

My other classmates (F, 20-22) insist that he is romantically interested in me, and that he could be giving the present as a segue into asking me out. I told them that it's probably not true, since I know that he likes some other girls in our class, and that I don't find him physically attractive anyways. After some back and forth with these friends, one of them said I was being \"superficial.\" Even though this whole argument was based on a complete hypothetical, I felt insulted and ashamed. Is this friend right? \n\nAlso, just to be clear, if the situation was reversed, I wouldn't mind a friend saying that they weren't attracted to me, nor would I call someone superficial for having preferences.

            "input": "My grandfather is a racist homophobic asshole.  I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?",

            "input": "Sorry for the impending wall of text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background before starting.\n\nSorry for possible poor grammar, English isn't my first language.\n\nThe story happened last year. Me and my good friend Marie (fake name for obvious reasons) were sub-renting (pretty illegal) a flat we had found on the French equivalent of Craigslist in the city we go to college at.\n\nMarie and I, at the time, we really close friends and were really excited to share a flat. It just didn't work out as flatmates because we were so incompatible personnality and lifestyle wise so we argued for a lot of stuff although we were perfectly getting along outside the flat.\n\nThe flat had 2 bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom.  The main focus here is on the bedrooms and living room. Apart from the technical issues there was in the flat, there was ONE big, main issue.  The guy subrenting the flat didn't want to include his bedroom in the deal so we were left with the 2nd bedroom and the living room (with either a couch or a crappy inflatable mattress to sleep on).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarie and I agreed to take turns. One week one of us would get the bedroom, one week one of us would sleep on the couch and vice versa, fair enough. We even agreed that on sunday evening, the one in charge of the bedroom would change the sheets and clean the room so the other one wouldn't have to deal with the other one's mess, fair enough.\n\nWe strongly agreed on those terms and we would bend the rules if some people were over, although the only time we bent them was when I let her use the bed a few nights during some of MY weeks so she could have privacy with her fuck buddy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to 2 months in, and I have to go back to my hometown for a week because my bestfriend had unexpectedly died and I wanted to be around my friends to grieve and cry together. After one tough week I went back to my flat, completely, mentally worn out, and just sad. I only wanted to go to sleep in the bed because it was MY turn to use the bedroom.\n\n I asked Marie to do the switcheroo as usual but didn't want this time. I asked her why and she told me In a very very annoyed and arrogant way that I had to sleep on the couch because during the week in my hometown I could sleep in my own bed so it was unfair that I got to sleep in a bed 2 weeks in row. \n\nI was really surprised of such an answer, as she totally knew that I lost my friend and that I was in a really tough spot in my life (for some other reasons). After some quick back and forth I didn't have the energy nor the patience to argue and just sterly told her \"Fuck off\" and left the room to play some games. (Had she argued calmly I would have definitely tried to find common ground but in this case, nope.)\n\n She snapped at me and insulted me and talking nonsense about how I was inconsiderate, bringing up stuff unrelated to the argument and I just told her \"What-thefuck-ever\". She started to cry and eventually complied.  She guilt tripped me into apologising to her for being so mean but she never apologised for being so insensitive to me. Rules are rules ffs. The few common friends we had didn't give a crap about the argument (rightfully so) and a few friends of mine say I'm NTA although I should have handled it more diplomatically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm asking you Reddit, AITA for telling her to F off because she arrogantly wanted to argue? am I NTA because she acted like an entitled brat? Is ESH because although she didn't act appropriately I could've  handled the matter more nicely?\n\n(We're no longer friends as I moved back to my hometown after finishing college and just didn't want to be her friend anymore due to further arguments on other stuff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask for INFO as I may have forgotten some details along the way! \n\nThanks for reading!",

            "input": "Hello! \n\nHere's an argument we had while driving home..\n\n\n\nFirst for some background. \n\n\n\nMy fiance and I both own our own cars. Both are over 100k miles. Mine has about 20k miles more and is a little bit younger. Mine is worth about 2-3k more on Kelly blue book. We have separate car insurance.  I have comprehensive/collision and I thiiiink he no longer has comprehensive/collision. \n\n\nSince our driveway forces us to park each other in , for convenience, we switch cars about every other day. Aka some days I drive his car and some days I drive my car and likewise. \n\n\n\nWe have split finances and don't currently plan on merging them although we do have a share account for food/house expenses that we contribute equally to. \n\n\nOn to the argument... \nIt came up that he assumed if I got into an accident in his car and totalled it that I would buy him a new car (not new new.. just new to us). His rational was that if he himself got in an accident in mine that he would feel bad and would want to make it up to me and do the same. \n\n\nI replied that I wasn't comfortable with that. He clarified only if one of us was at fault for the accident/ it was caused by stupidity on our part.  \n\n\n\nMy thought process is that each of our cars are our responsibility to take care of.\n\n\nHowever if I dinged his car and it was fixable I would try to fix it/make him whole. But if the car it totalled I doubt he would get the same car/same year/same mileage as  it would make more sense to upgrade. I would probably offer to help with the cost.. but not front it all. That would put us in the awkward situation where one if us would have to buy two cars back to back potentially since both of them are getting further along in years. Although I doubt we will have to replace them for years to come.. hopefully. \n\nHe actually seemed ok with my reasoning and I'm glad this was brought up before either of us got into a bad accident (knock on wood). \n\nAITA for not wanting to buy him a new car if I wrecked it? \n\nWhat do you guys think would be a fair? \n",
