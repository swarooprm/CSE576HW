The SOA said if you want revenue sharing, you must follow what we say and do.\n\nFrom then on, the village council no longer existed, and a “city” council took over turning to state laws as government decree. Village law and order, and thousands of years of experience, was dismantled.\n\nAs a child in Shaktoolik, the village council and those on it was the heartbeat of the community and everyone behaved as expected. Elders were on these councils and carried on. In my day, homicides and suicides and violent crimes were taboo and not to be condoned. Things have indeed changed for the worse.",

I also know several young women with their children being raised by their parents while they go out and party.  \n\nYou won't find me arguing about bad fathers, but please don't try to convince me that abortions are all the result or rape or male aggression.  And yes, my wife and I know that some children are used to boost income from welfare services (who really can't track where the money is spent).  This is not a guess, but I don't have any number of you.\n\nMy wife bore the 'puppies' too, but we tried to share the responsibilities of both work and child rearing.  I love women.   \nPlease note that I said 2 are better than 1, that includes two women or two men.\n\nThanks for a serious response Jade",

If the police were convinced the shooter might shoot elsehwere (as well they might have been) it seems to me that following up on the video evidence of the obvious shooter could be done while other police officers were doing further analysis of the folks on the video with a gun out but no obvious connection to the shooting.

When a commissioner engages in grandstanding, personal insults, and nonsensical statements, you have to just roll your eyes; it's a volunteer position and nobody else wants the job so you're stuck. When his behavior escalates into yelling, cursing, disruptions, police visits, and walking out when there is the people's business to be done, the chair has a duty to take action. If her action crossed a legal line there is no excuse for that, but it can be remedied.\nThe chair's intent in calling the executive session was clearly to take the people's business seriously. Maybe she did it wrong, but that doesn't change or excuse her fellow commissioner's inappropriate behavior that she was attempting to address.",

If you look at the Former Soviet Union, you will see a country where fewer than .2% of the people personally controlled what was done with just over 40% of the resources.

Today, at least in 2010,  the upper income .2% in the US  controlled just over 28% of the wealth resources.  I don't know where we are right now but that segment did grow even through the Obama presidency.  So now with tax breaks to the very wealthy, and our very high proposals for the military, what may happen here?  There have been movements in both red and blue states for succession.

In 2004 Keillor explained his own in his book 'HOMEGROWN DEMOCRAT'.\n\nSo, Froggy, for merciless anti-democrat satire, one should of course seek a DIFFERENT satirist, one with Republican or TeaPartyish views: ANOTHER droll writer, ideally as incisive & well-read as Keillor, but with a neo'conservative' outlook.

Both cases were based on testimony by felons with extensive criminal  records who were also drug users and/or dealers, and who had already earlier in their lives accused others of abuse. In both cases bishops paid the false accusers obscene sums of Catholic people's money. Cardinal Pell is accused by two men who fit the exact same profile, although it remains to be seen whether they will seek Catholic people's church donations.

Could this be construed that there may be some degree of 'sacerdotality' belonging to the diaconate?\nBefore any decision on whether women can receive Orders, the precise nature f each Order needs to be defined.\nAs for getting used to women in vestments the experience of the Anglican Communion needs to be taken into account.

The idea was to try to rent or lease the facility, but with the land zoning being for jail use, and the distance out in the woods, we did not get any serious offers. I kept the buildings up the best I could, with ventilation in all the rooms, fire prevention all around, grass cut and watered, all systems working, as well as security. Other employees worked security also, though they were no longer SO employees. With no renters, and no sign of re-opening for inmates, the Sheriff at the time said he would no longer pay for the upkeep, and turned it over to the regular County Parks Dept.

By your logic, the bishops are negligent in failing to assert that a Catholic cannot vote for Trump in good conscience.  You’re probably right, but I don’t think the bishops should engage in partisan politics.",

Why is that happening? The professor attributes it to wage disinflation and he may well be right to a degree but he does not address why the significant price inflation has taken place. Given the extreme competition for available housing, someone has managed to accrue the capital from somewhere. Generational population growth has remained relatively steady and new construction has been commensurate with that growth. Demand, however, is outstripping supply. This is because immigration growth is increasing at three times that of generational growth and many millennials can't compete with their wealth.",

In this era, schools without librarians.  If Measure 97 begins to heal the educational decay, then I am voting for it.",

The first thing any oppressive government does is disarm its people. It is always the goal of totalitarians and leftists in particular.  No people ever remain free for long without the means to defend that freedom, sometimes from their own 'government'. \n\nIn WWII the Japanese never considered invading the US mainland because by their own admission they knew  \"there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass...\"  Who did Hitler disarm first?

In Alberta, for example, tax money follows students to Catholic, private, and other sectarian (e.g., Dutch Reformed) schools, as well to district-run and charter public schools.  Students in all of these schools must meet provincial standards, which are assessed in 3rd (optional), 6th and 9th grade (the Province's highest level assessment is PISA). There is an integrated provincial curriculum, along with student, parent, and teacher guides. Schools have the option not to use them. But every year, every school's value-added results (achievement growth above what student demographics would predict) is widely published, and most parents use to make their school choices. So what people here in the US call a \"voucher\" system can, in fact, work well. But multiple design factors are critical to its success.",

In point of fact, Christ rewarded St. Dismas with paradise, for accepting his justice and asking forgiveness.  Mercy can be found in the fact that, despite our sins, as long as we seek forgiveness we can still receive our eternal reward.  In the case of Capital Punishment, executing criminals humanely is an example of mercy.\nIs Capital punishment the reason for high murder rates?  Hardly.  If the death penalty does not act as a deterrent it is because the convicted spends on average 13 years on death row.  If the sentence was carried out swiftly, it might well be a deterrent.  Murder is barbaric.  Its just punishment isn't.  By not carrying out justice the state devalues the lives of the victims.",

When a KW is needed on the demand grid, it must instantly be generated for that demand or the lights don't come on. The regulated power base that we all pay for has to double the investment for back up generation such as natural gas fired processes for wind farms. Secondly they are enormously expensive. Wind and solar are heavily subsidized by tax payers and utility rate payers. Wind alone subsidies  in a $2.50/mmbtu natural gas market amount to $6.25/mmbtu in real cost. this is a fact that is conveniently ignored. This hurts Xcel and their power customers because as the rates for power go up, demand destruction kicks in and Xcel is not selling as much power as they need to grow their business to stay in business. Coal will continue to be a huge part of India and China because they are emerging economies and need cheap energy",

Crazy right, they even had the attorney at city hall convinced that there wasn't enough business for anymore cabs and they believed it. Supply and demand said it wasn't true they just weren't supplying enough so most of the market share fell by the wayside. \nUnderstanding that.transportation falls under supply and demand.

But in the case of RAPE specifically; (I am aware that child sexual abuse may not be rape in the adult sense ) is there greater clarity that it should be reported to civil authorities. I agree with Cynical Saint that any type of child sexual abuse, should be considered ... rape.

The preponderance of the research shows marijuana consumption is NOT a significant cause of auto accidents.

You will read in the Argonne offshore wind study that the IWTs can be seen for 25 miles or more away and were a definite negative factor on tourism and at night the red flashing lights were also a major negative.  \n\nInteresting that Peck the former State Energy Administrator is working for one of the wind developer.\nGo to Wind Action Alert at www.windaction.org to see photos of a newer industrial wind turbine project off.

That is about $50.4 million per mile.  HART, if it ever gets finished, will be 20 miles long and at current estimates will cost $500 million per mile, or ten times more per mile than it cost the Japanese to build its new Hokkaido line.  New York’s East Side Access is 6 miles in a tunnel.   Current cost estimate is $10.2 billion or $1.7 billion per mile, or 34 times more than the Japanese rail project.

Even after accounting for the smaller offset of respending that $1 through the government economy, cutting the PFD still represents ANOTHER $500 million or so loss to the OVERALL Alaska economy. Yes, it benefits some in the government economy -- which now include the recipients of ‪#‎AKOilCredits‬ (SMH) -- but using ISER's numbers it is clear that PFD cuts will come at the expense of the OVERALL Alaska economy, making what already is a challenged economic situation even worse.

You just don't think bigotry is bad because you're not the victim of it in your version of a freely associated society.\n\nYour post literally scares the hell out of me.",

Hammers, and other tools are used to kill more people according to the FBI's UCR stats and no one is trying to ban those.  Nor do these same people crying for gun control recognize that guns are used in over 2.5 million cases of self defense per year. The fact is if you could find a way to ban all firearms and actually remove them from society we would be far worse off. Here is why firearms do not take great physical strength to use. Young and old male and female weak and strong can all learn how to use firearms efficiently. That means a 110 pound woman can defend herself equally against a 250 pound athletic man.

What he has done, as a number of previous popes from time to time over the past 2000 years, is to emphasize the ways out from a state of sin to one of forgiveness in the Light of Christ.  He has pushed the bishops to be the pastoral teachers their office was always intended to be - disciples of Jesus.

One of the problems with this whole issue of reporting is that most countries do not have comprehensive reporting laws, so that in failing to report abuse, the bishops were not breaking any civil law.

Yet we fall short in eliminating barriers that keep 15% of the congregation from hearing. 3) Immediate fixes include training lectors, celebrants, and homilists to speak less rapidly, enunciate clearly, and use microphones properly. A Hearing loop won't fix a garbled word. 4) When necessary, qualified sound professionals should be engaged. Acoustics should be part of each church design. I can point to examples where it wasn't. 5) Parish health ministries should be involved.

Part of the reason is that countries who don't have as much money to spend (Russia and China for examples), have concentrated on relatively cheap defensive weapons like missiles and may have???  missile systems that are more advanced than the U.S.  4. Cheap development:  With all those U.S. factories over in China for example, it is easy to copy U.S. designs without spending money for development.  5. Potential for instability within the U.S.",

Compared to what you ask?  Well, Obamacare started with the \"assumption\" that there were \"47 million\" people who had no health insurance.  Obamacare \"covered\" about \"27 million\" by expanding Medicaid to pay cover them and raised taxes to pay for this additional cost of around $10 billion.  However, when organized labor (like the ILWU) found out that Obamacare was going to impose a \"Cadillac Tax\" on their generous union healthcare benefits starting at 40%, the proverbial kukai hit the fan.  So now, the taxes are not being collected to pay for Obamacare and only the Federal deficit is getting bigger.  So what is the solution?  The GOP plan may not be great, but at least is being realistic about the situation.  Meanwhile, the Democrats are starting to line up to support the AHCA, because the imposition of the Cadillac Tax is not happening.",

Because the U.S. installed massive military forces throughout the Arab region including Somalia. Right smack in the middle of Islamic most holy lands. Yes, a repeat of 12-13th centuries Christian crusader war. There you have it. You hit them, they hit you back. \n\nOh yes, the last Christian crusader war lasted 200 years.

In the genocidal process of invading every part of the world, capitalists have slaughtered more people than communism has, and capitalists have destroyed every attempt to make communism decent.\n  You might have noticed - communism has been defeated, but the world is still at war almost everywhere, poverty prevails,  economic suffering is ubiquitous, and man's inhumanity to man is omnipresent.",

If the ILH doesn't agree with the decision than that should establish their own tournament of some kind.  The state public high schools will be able to continue without the ILH.

This demand for dollars increases the value of the dollar compared to the Chinese yuan. If the Chinese sold its dollar assets and saved the money in China, the dollar would depreciate and the Chinese currency appreciate. Therefore, to maintain a weak exchange rate, the Chinese need to keep buying dollar assets. In order to make their goods more competitive, Asian currencies have been forced to devalue to a lower rate vs the US dollar than the yuan. It's basic economics.\n\nThe problem with a weak currency is it creates inflationary pressure. Since China is a big importer of commodities, a weaker exchange rate increases the cost of living and the cost of raw materials. As result, the Chinese Government has allowed a small appreciation in the exchange rate to help mitigate inflationary pressure. They have done this by trying to diversify away from the US dollar, but they still buy dollars.",

If they did, where have they been?!  \n\nWhat's now been exposed is a colossal lack of leadership, trying to cover-up years of a complete failure of city management.",

Perpetrator holds ideological goals they demand be implemented upon society in the way of official policy.\n\n2. Perpetrator intentionally seeks, as victims, civilian non-combatants.\n\n3. Perpetrator has access to non-violent options as recourse, but choses to not use them.\n\nAt this point there is zero evidence - none - regarding requirement number one, above.\n\nBy that (very reasonable) definition, Sandy Hook (the school slaughter) was not an act of terrorism. Today's attack may prove to be another Sandy Hook. \n\nAnd, by the way, by that (very reasonable) definition, some of the attacks against soldiers in recent years were also not acts of terrorism, though they were strangely labeled as such by the media (see item two in above definition).",

In 2016, we elected Mr. Trump. \nIn 2014 and 2015, Pope Francis gathered the bishops of the world into a synod to discuss the family, then wrote an Apostolic Exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, to focus our ideas and energies on divine mercy. But the divisions among us appear to grow deeper. \nI think Pope Francis has tried everything he knows to bring about change, but we and our world have become so resistant to everything but what we want to hear, it all falls on deaf ears.

So a weak person takes matters in their own hands, with a gun.

If they don't approve of it, they should repudiate the message and stop the nonsensical preaching. Oh, did I say \"preaching?\"  I thought that preaching usually has some content related to the Gospel, salvation, etc. \n\n4) If he was \"preaching\" discrimination in any form, it has nothing to do with the 1st Amendment, it's against the law and a person doing this shoul never be employed by the government.

Trump wasted time and legal resources because he drafted a bill affecting countries and not people from any country who could be terrorists like Obama did.

Egan Warming Centers are low-barrier, with people accepted into church-based shelters so long as their behavior is not disruptive.

Run totally by volunteers, the Egan centers demonstrate that it is possible to provide low-barrier shelter for all types of people, including those not admitted into The Mission due to its rules.  A year-round shelter tied into social service providers and addiction treatment programs would be a major step toward the reduction of homelessness in Eugene, assuming there are even greater efforts on the part of the City to provide affordable housing for those in need.

The appeal is a return to morality and righteousness which I think you share?  G-d grants us freedom to choose what we or in whom we want to believe but if one professes to be a Christian then there is a code of conduct as informed by the Bible that one should aspire to.  The Bible teaches that G-d loves the sinner (every single human being) regardless of background, association etc, and desires them all to come to the saving knowledge of the Messiah.  And if one chooses to follow the Messiah then one must repent from certain acts that G-d finds offensive.  Association comes with obligations, in any sphere of life!

I can give you plenty of examples where it was liberal sexual views and clergy sexual activity that became systemic and allowed abuse to occur and continue. If people doubt this as a possibility then I rest my case in regard to the problems that occur when we fail to account for psychological causes, as well as historical shifts in approaches to sexual behaviour. Why is it always the conservative church that is seen to be the main culprit? Both approaches have their errors. If anyone wants to respond to this post, I'd prefer they answer the above one first.",

It is a shame that past and current prime ministers have been willing to sacrifice Canada's defense needs on the altar of political expediency. Although the United States would most likely defend Canada in the event that it is targeted by a foreign aggressor, the best way to guarantee that we are protected is to enter into a joint missile-defense agreement without further delay. Rather than benefit from US military protection by default, Canada needs to pull its own weight within a mutual defense pact.

The second time was October of 2010, my wife and I drove in, looked around and left, we were on our way to Homer. It was raining. The last time was August of 2015, my wife, son and daughter in law arrived by Alaska State Fast Ferry from Valdez. It was a beautiful bright clear day and the sun was  beating down on us. The activity at the landing area was hectic. We ate a fish and chips lunch at a little summertime restaurant and had a beer on the deck of another restaurant overlooking the harbor and did some shopping.
