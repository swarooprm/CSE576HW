This was someone I could envision myself spending the rest of my life with. However, the last year or so Iâ€™ve been growing more and more discontent. Iâ€™ve noticed a decline in his personal hygiene and the amount of effort he puts into our relationship.\n\nI feel completely unappreciated. I do most of the cleaning, purchase most of our food, give him as many rides as I can, and initiate sex more often than not. Lately heâ€™ll just fall asleep on me if I try to get us to do anything of that nature.\n\nIâ€™ve brought these issues up multiple times. Iâ€™ve tried to be as compassionate as possible. I KNOW that some are the issues are because he is depressed. Weâ€™ve talked about it at length. I also suffer from depression and anxiety, but I have been to therapy and he has not. I have given him links to several different programs for â€œaffordableâ€? mental healthcare, but I know he hasnâ€™t followed up with any of it. \n\nAny time I try to talk about ANY of our issues, he either gets irrationally angry with me or completely shuts down and refuses to talk at all. Heâ€™ll tell me what I want to hear or go into self destruction mode, saying that heâ€™s the shittiest person in the world (which I do not agree with, obviously).\n\nI just feel at this point that I CANâ€™T talk to him about how Iâ€™m feeling at all. I donâ€™t want to keep harping on the same issues. I donâ€™t want to pressure him into having sex with me. I donâ€™t want him to tell me what I want to hear. This is why I had the thought of just writing a letter or something, completely detailing everything that Iâ€™ve been having issues with. Iâ€™m just afraid of that blowing up in my face as well.\n\nIâ€™m not sure exactly what my next move should be. I want to work through these issues, not just immediately give up on our relationship. This is the only thing I can think of that would allow me to get all of my thoughts out in a cohesive manner, but Iâ€™m afraid of him taking it the wrong way.\n\nSo, Reddit, would writing this letter make me the asshole? Is there a better way to handle this that I canâ€™t see? ",

She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse.

I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way.

I (14F) was very close with her up through that but then when I started 8th grade I realized that I actually didnâ€™t like being around her. The bad things hadnâ€™t started yet though. \n\n       A couple months ago Ashley came over to my house and told me that she had started doing drugs. Not cocaine or anything, but weed and experimental things like cough syrup. Also, weed is legal where I live, but certainly not for minors. Itâ€™s not for medicinal purposes or anything, either, she just does it for fun. And okay, yes, if Iâ€™m being honest, I donâ€™t know that much about drugs and how safe they are, but I just donâ€™t want to associate myself with anything that could end up hurting me or my future. \n\n        So I didnâ€™t do weed with her when she invited me and now Iâ€™m beginning to subtly push her away. At least I thought it was subtle. Ashley  said before that she didnâ€™t expect me to pick up the phone when she called. I think she knows Iâ€™m pushing her away. She was already very clingy and used to call me every day to ask to hang out, so she still called a lot, just without an answer. \n\nIâ€™m worried that if I directly tell her that I donâ€™t want to be her friend that she would go back into a state of depression, because she got close to hurting herself last time. She missed about a month of school because of it. Iâ€™ve begun going to therapy too because all she is is a negative energy in my life. \n\n\nTo sum it up: I feel awful about trying to leave my friend who went through intense depression  recently but she started experimenting with drugs and I donâ€™t want to put me or my future at risk. Sheâ€™s also manipulative naturally and I still wouldnâ€™t want to be her friend even without the drugs. AITA??",

Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.\n\nMia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.\n\nNow upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding.

Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently.

She would expect me to pay on our dates etc. (This is normal, I get courtship, and continued doing this for some time) until things got more serious. 2 years or so into our relationship we began splitting tabs when going out etc. we made roughly the same income and were students at the time... little did I know that she resented me for this.. she hated splitting the tab and bills after we moved into together. She always believed the man should be the breadwinner. Despite us both graduating from college and getting good jobs, I still feel the tension is there. We now combine all of our finances. I make roughly double her income now... but I know that if I made less than her, we would probably argue a lot more. Her mindset is even applied outside of finances. She simply believes that the man should take the burden of everything. She believes her gender allows her a free pass to bend the rules. We fight about this constantly. I feel that she has a double standard when it comes to our relationship. She can spend money on things because she needs them, but Iâ€™m rarely ever allowed to spend money without her complaining. Funny thing is that when it comes to chores, she wants 50/50 in that area.. seems pretty convenient... Sheâ€™s like a â€œselectiveâ€? traditional gal.

Therefore, I ways do all the homework and study a lot.\n\nLast semester, my friends and I had some group project to do and there were 4 (small) papers we had to submit, one per month. The professor gave us a grade for each and it counted for 20% of the yearly grade for this class. I was really motivated to get good grades and so I organised the group work. I told my friends to review all the stuff we had to so we could talk about it the next week and do what we have to do. One of the friends (R) did nothing though, and since he was not informed, he did not participate in the first group project. \n\nIt was the same for the 3 other papers. R did not do anything, all he did was text us to ask if we want to do it or if we already did it. He never took action and did his part as he was supposed to. When I once asked him to do something, he just asked another group for their solutions instead of actually doing it. It would have taken 10-15min! \n\nThe problem for me is that I really hate people who profit off of other people's work. It's not about grades or time spent but it's a matter of principle.

Every time I see him, he's also complaining about everything and anything. As I am a very positive and happy person, I don't like this attitude at all.\n\nRecently, R asked me for some help for a homework. I told him no and that he should please just ignore me.

Iâ€™m going to call him Jeff for this post. We met in middle school and ended up going to the same high school too, but we had an extremely rocky friendship (even longer story so Iâ€™m skipping it) until the end of my sophomore year when he convinced me to join a club at our school. We started hanging out a lot during my junior year, and I developed a crush on both him and my now-girlfriend about that October. I had come out to him two weeks previous and he was chill about it, but I knew he was straight so I figured if I asked him out, heâ€™d just reject me and I could move on with my life since that avenue was entirely closed and ask out my current girlfriend instead.\n\nTo my surprise, he said yes anyway. The way he said yes should have been my first red flag. He said, â€œWell, youâ€™re a dude, so I wonâ€™t date you, but we can be friends with benefits.â€? Now, I was stupid and felt validated and was shocked so I said sure and we made out in his car. When he took me home after that, I felt weird, like I wasnâ€™t really myself? Itâ€™s hard to describe, but I found myself staring at my reflection in the mirror and feeling off for a while that night. I brushed it off at the time, but itâ€™ll come back up later.\n\nOver the next two weeks, he slowly warmed up to the idea of us dating. These are the next red flags. He asked me if he could call me his girlfriend, which I was so...weirded out that I was left speechless. We also did a lot of semi-public making out and third base which made me sort of uncomfortable but I wanted the relationship (one that I felt I barely could even have in the first place considering the circumstances) to work so I didnâ€™t say anything and just went along with it when heâ€™d ask to make out for an hour in his car or for me to give him a handjob.\n\nEventually my own anxiety caught up with me and I impulsively broke it off that December. He seemed crushed, as he was finally developing romantic feelings for me, but the addition of romantic pressure to what I recognized was mounting discomfort with physical stuff (particularly because the dynamic of the physical stuff made me feel like â€œthe girlâ€? of the relationship) was too much for me so I nipped it in the bud to save myself.\n\nIf only I had listened to my gut and my raging dysphoria.\n\nHe ended up dating a girl pretty soon after and I started dating my current girlfriend for the first time (our first relationship was pretty dry because we were both pretty awkward so we broke it off after a few months, but weâ€™re extremely happy and almost at 6 months going strong this time around!). However, after we had both broken up with/been broken up with our SOs, he asked me if I wanted to try a relationship again in June. We had been best friends the whole time we were broken up, so it wasnâ€™t hard for feelings to be rekindled there and I agreed.\n\nThis time he upped the ante sexually and every single time we hung out heâ€™d ask for some sort of sexual act, usually a blowjob but sometimes more. Heâ€™d also ask me if he could do things to me that made me extremely dysphoric (touching certain parts of my body for extended periods of time and using certain language) and Iâ€™d tell him no repeatedly but heâ€™d still ask almost every time we hung out. Our relationship continued into my senior year, which worked because he was in college but living at home. We only saw one another on weekends, time that became unspoken â€œhis timeâ€? with me.\n\nI barely hung out with my friends outside of school functions that year because all of my weekends were taken up with Jeff. He didnâ€™t have any friends at college (this probably will come off as biased but everyone Iâ€™ve known from high school agrees that he has a weird superiority-inferiority complex that leads him to not give people the time of day if theyâ€™re not â€œsmart enoughâ€? for him) and his high school friends largely went elsewhere except for two of them.\n\nMost of our time in person and over text was taken up with him talking about his interests and his financial problems with me just having to go along with the conversation and him asking for sexual favors (either sexting, which I was uncomfortable with, or actual sex, which I increasingly turned down out of the crippling anxiety/dysphoria it gave me and actual physical pain it caused me in some circumstances). Because I was in senior year, more and more of my time was taken up with college applications and big projects, so I started saying no to more and more invitations to hang out.\n\nI will admit that thatâ€™s not always the only reason I said no, as he was becoming clingy and demanding to the point where just thinking about the weekend made me uncomfortable. I tried my best to communicate my discomfort to him, to the point where I broke down crying on his bed trying to explain my discomfort when he kept asking me for a blowjob when we were watching a movie. After I finished crying, he asked me again and coerced me into putting his dick in my mouth, after which I broke down crying again and asked if he could drive me home. He did, and that was the last time we hung out, as after that I would both deflect for OBVIOUS REASONS! and also because AP exams were approaching and I needed to study.\n\nThe night before one of my exams, he texted me asking if I could come over. I said no, I was studying and had an exam the next day, but he then launched into a long message about how I was avoiding him and â€œhe never had this much work in senior year and he had taken much harder classes than I didâ€? (which may be true on some level as he was taking engineering classes, but I was still taking 4 AP classes, a dual enrollment math class, and an intensive film seminar where I had to make my own short film that was due in a few weeks, so the comparison wasnâ€™t fair in my opinion). He threw out a few different arguments all with the intent to keep me from studying for an exam (including but not\nlimited to making fun of the college I committed to when itâ€™s literally the same college he goes to!) I paid $93 dollars for just so I could give him a blowjob and cuddle him for two hours maximum. I had had enough at that point and told him as such and ended the conversation.\n\nWe didnâ€™t talk much from there and two weeks later he broke up with me, citing how distant I was for the previous few months. As he was breaking up with me, he asked if we could â€œstill cuddle sometimesâ€? to which I said yes, mostly because I didnâ€™t want to burn the bridge at that point, didnâ€™t want him to be upset with me (as he had fallen into a depression in the past over ended relationships), and was riding the relief high of no longer being trapped in the relationship.\n\nFor clarity, I didnâ€™t break up with him myself because I was too scared of disappointing him or at worst sending him spiraling into depression. He was still my best friend, and I cared about him, but I know my choice to sour our romantic relationship without talking to him properly was a very very bad one. I apologized to him for it the day we broke up and he seemed to understand and forgave me.\n\nWe broke up a week before prom, so I ended up going with a group of friends (he didnâ€™t even want to go to prom so this was the plan anyway). It was a great night that I still remember well, except for what happened afterwards. My best friend who weâ€™ll call Nina planned on having a get-together afterwards. We usually had holiday parties or afterparties at her house so this was normal, with the only difference being the very small number of people coming to her house this time around (only like 7, two of whom left before the sleepover portion and one of whom being her boyfriend who was on break from college). Jeff asked her a few days before prom if she was having a party, to which she said yes. No other words were exchanged - he didnâ€™t ask what kind of party, how many people, times, and not if he was invited.\n\nAt midnight, we hear the doorbell ring. Iâ€™m upstairs in the spare bedroom (which is on the third floor, for reference) with my current-girlfriend and her then-best friend while Nina, her boyfriend, and our other friend are in the kitchen downstairs. I donâ€™t hear who it is or know whatâ€™s going on until a few minutes later. Jeff and his friend are standing in the doorway of the spare bedroom. Nina is standing behind him looking EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he just stands there, smiling awkwardly and not saying anything.\n\nMy CGF asks him what heâ€™s doing here, to which he responds that they were coming back from a metal show and decided to stop by since they were in the area. Keep in mind this is a private party, it was literally the middle of the night, Ninaâ€™s parents and sister were sleeping on the second floor, and he had shown up unannounced and with an additional person most of us werenâ€™t really friends with. And he thought this was okay.\n\nHe doesnâ€™t leave until every single person there expresses to him that theyâ€™re not going to speak with him until he leaves (apparently he had specifically asked Nina where I was so he could come talk to me, which he should have realized was weird because we hadnâ€™t spoken sense the breakup). When asked about it repeatedly after the fact by me and other people, he refuses to see that he did anything weird, wrong, or otherwise.\n\nAfter that, talking was a bit awkward so I asked him if we could take a bit of a break from our friendship too, as I knew he wasnâ€™t totally over me and I wasnâ€™t totally over my own discomfort being around him (multiplied by that weird encounter after prom).\n\nThe longer we didnâ€™t have contact, though, the more I realized that - not to be dramatic - I m",

I lived with one of these roommates last year and we got along well, but the other four are completely new.\n\nLast year, I lived in this house and we had a command hook in the bathroom that I would use to hang up my towel when I showered. While I was out of the country last summer, one my roommates (J) basically redecorated and refurbished the place. When I got back, the command hook was still there, so I hung my towel up there for the shower. Throughout the entirety of the fall semester, no one complained about this whatsoever. I assumed it was the same command hook that was there from last year, but in reality, J bought a new one and hung it up.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, I came home drunk from a bar and for some reason, J decided that 1:00am on a Saturday would be the best time to tell me that I could no longer use this command hook because he bought it and would like to use it to hang up his clothes while he showered. Drunk aitathrowaway1321 slurred \"yeah okay, whatever\" and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning, having absolutely zero memory of this conversation, I showered and then went to the gym to sweat out the hangover. After coming back, I jumped in the shower and noticed that my towel was missing! There was a little blue sticky note next to the hook that said \"missing something? Follow the sticky notes!\" I followed the sticky notes downstairs naked (because no towel) and was greeted with my towel hanging downstairs next to a sticky note that said \"bet you must've missed me after you came back from the gym! Next time, buy your own fucking command hook!\"\n\nI hung the towel on the bannister outside the bathroom to avoid a fight, but I chewed my roommate out for being passive aggressive and not talking to me beforehand. We still sometimes have arguments over this when I forgetfully hang the towel on this command hook, which he really only uses to hang his clothes on while he showers. I feel like his passive aggressive response and him getting angry at me is way overblown for this kind of situation; furthermore, it's kind of unreasonable for him to expect me to change my routine which bothered no one for five whole months! Furthermore, command hooks are literally like $2, so I feel like the response is disproportionate to the overall crime. This situation has also caused my other housemates to gang up on me too, so needless to say, I'm not too happy about it.\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking that my roommate is being unreasonable?

I get along famously with my mom (even though she's a helicopter, I love her dearly). But, my Dad and his family is another story. Since I started highschool (about 7 years ago now) he and his second wife decided to work constantly. They own a small business, and want it to succeed. But, they also do a lot of volunteer work (I'm so proud of them for it!) However, this has left the task of running our household on my siblings and my shoulders.\n\nFor a few years, this was fine. In highschool I was always on top of my work, and didn't mind coming home at \\~5 pm to cook dinner, clean the house, do the dishes, study a bit, and go to bed. Between my three siblings and I, we've kept a fairly well functioning house! However, as I've gotten older the demands have further increased.\n\nI'm in my junior year of college now, and commute to a nice school \\~40 minutes away from my household. After I spend 4 hours in classes, I go to therapy for an hour (to help with anxiety), and then work a part time shift for 3 hours. After that, I make the \\~40 minute commute home by train. It's around 5 at night when I finally get back.\n\nImmediately after arriving home, I have to put away the dishes I did the previous night. Then I do whatever chores need to be done that day. Often times I walk to the nearby grocery store to buy groceries for the week. I come home, cook dinner, and by that point it's 8 at night. I quickly eat, and then go to finish up whatever else needs to be done (laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom/kitchen, etc). Overall, I finally start on my homework at around 9 pm, and typically go to bed at 1 am... Only to get up early and start the process over again.\n\nI don't have a problem helping out around the house. In fact, I think it makes me more prepared for when I want my own home! But, I've come to resent my Dad and Step-Mom who decided to offload everything onto us. The tipping point for me was Friday, when they asked me to cover the cost of groceries this month. I'm barely making enough to cover my textbooks each semester, so it's a huge ask. I didn't say anything to them about it, just decided to grin and bare it.\n\nThey snap at me whenever something isn't done.

I broke my spine and got a brain injury. Iâ€™ve already had one surgery and weâ€™re waiting on number two. I had to move back in with my parents and temporarily close my business. I cannot do a lot of basic things for myself...including bathing. Itâ€™s been extremely hard on me, not just physically, but also mentally. To add to the craziness, I was recently diagnosed with cancer, and then almost immediately after, sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. Itâ€™s been a ride, yâ€™all. \n\nBut over the last few months Iâ€™ve lost **everyone,** and I donâ€™t know why. \n\nThree of my very best and closest girlfriends have straight up ghosted me. These girls helped me through my first surgery two years ago no problem. These were the girls who were my cheerleaders and helpers for my business, who threw me surprise birthday parties and called me when shit was going down in their lives. I thought we were ride or die. But when I asked girlfriend 1 (weâ€™ll call her Micha) if she still had pictures of her wedding cake that I made for her a few years back, her answer was oddly distant and cold. When I tried to reply, I was blocked. No hints, no conversation, just blocked. \n\nI asked girlfriend 2 (letâ€™s call her Kelly) about it to see if she knew what was wrong, and she brushed it off. â€œI think Micha was scared because you mentioned committing suicide (over a year ago).â€? This didnâ€™t make any sense. Micha was the girlfriend Iâ€™d had the longest of the three, and she saw me through a horrible breakup in college where depression and suicide was mentioned. I did the same for her about a year later. That had never been a spooky topic before. And besides, that comment had happened over a year ago. I figured she just must need space and dropped it. \n\nThen maybe a month later, Kelly says life is too busy to continue talking to me, and she wants a break. She sends that message to me and at least one other mutual friend. I didnâ€™t take it personally at the time because she was pulling away from everyone, not just me. I was concerned for her, but I wanted to respect her wishes so I told her that I loved her and whenever she was ready to chat and hangout again I would be here. \n\nBuuuut a month-ish after that is when my doctor first said â€œyou might have cancer, Iâ€™m sending you to an oncologist.â€? I was freaked the fuck out. I felt so alone and scared and I didnâ€™t want to tell my parents because it wasnâ€™t a definite yet and I didnâ€™t want to worry them. I needed my best friend so badly. So I called Kelly. She didnâ€™t answer (which I expected), so I left her a tearful voicemail apologizing for calling and saying that I wasnâ€™t trying to be disrespectful and invade her space, but the doc says I might have cancer and I was very scared. I just wanted a hug, honestly. She never returned my call. \n\nGirlfriend 3 (Nancy) moved to another state about a year ago, but we still stayed very close. Sending big birthday packages, long chats, lots of pictures back and forth and keeping each other very involved. She was supposed to be coming home soon and promised to visit, as my place is right down the road from her parents. But suddenly she stopped messaging too, around the same time as Kelly. I finally sent her a text that just said â€œNancy, I have something important to tell you.â€? after the diagnosis was confirmed. She said â€œSo do I. You go first.â€? I asked her if she could FaceTime, but she said she was still at work, so I said that was fine we can chat when she gets off or tomorrow, whatever works best for her. I never heard back. \n\nI sent all three girls a â€œwtf is going onâ€? message one tearful night not too long ago. It was long, and probably overwhelming (in fact I sent an apology for the length the next day) but honestly, for a â€œbest friendâ€? it shouldnâ€™t have been some crazy message. I told each of them my diagnosis and that Iâ€™m truly at the lowest of the low right now. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped in this shell of my body and thereâ€™s nothing I can do. I begged them to please tell me what I did wrong to make them ghost so I can fix it. I pleaded with each of them not to leave. But I also told them that they really hurt me, and I felt like I have been abandoned by those that I trusted the most during my deepest tome of need. I sent this individually over Facebook messenger because I naively thought that maybe I wasnâ€™t getting replies because their phones were dead or something. I have been left on read for all three of them, and Micha deleted me as a friend immediately after reading my message. \n\nI donâ€™t know what to do guys. All I can think of is that saying â€œif you keep smelling dog shit everywhere you go, maybe you should check your shoes.â€? Please tell me, AMITA? Iâ€™m so fucking mad at them. I would never straight up ghost a normal friend, never mind a best friend. *Especially* after they tell me that they have cancer, godfuckingdamn. It feels so shitty and Iâ€™m honestly more torn up about it than I am about the cancer.   \nI can provide more details if you want, I just didnâ€™t want to make this longer than it already is. Thank you for reading. ",

When my brother, sister and I were young, she always treated us as second class to my uncleâ€™s kids. I think this is because she didnâ€™t like my mother. My grandfather died when I was around 8 and he was a lovely man but he didnâ€™t prevent her behaving the way she did. \n\nMy parents separated when I was 11 and she didnâ€™t bother to stay in contact with me, my brother who was 16 and my sister who was 18. I donâ€™t believe she should take any blame for this lack of contact as we were the kids in the situation and she was the adult. \n\nMy dad basically disappeared from our lives for about 5 years or so as well and I later found she was abusive to him when he was growing up although Iâ€™m not sure what form that abuse took. \n\nMy brotherâ€™s eldest son was her great grandchild. He is now 15 and she has never met him. My brother has since had another child and my sister has two kids who again she has never met. I am now pregnant with my first child and I know she would not have them this baby either. However she has met and had a relationship with my cousins kids. \n\nI saw her for the first time in years at my Dadâ€™s 60th which I helped to organise, but I didnâ€™t know she would be there. My  Dadâ€™s girlfriend must have invited her. She didnâ€™t acknowledge me or my brother. My sister did not attend as she doesnâ€™t want a relationship with my father. \n\nI have somewhat repaired my relationship with my Dad but I keep it up for his sake mostly. I donâ€™t really get anything out of it. I just feel guilty if I donâ€™t have some sort of relationship with him. \n\nIâ€™m really uncomfortable with the thought of going to the funeral. I barely speak to my cousins and I know they will be fully involved in the funeral. Iâ€™m worried they will judge us for coming and blame us for not having a relationship with her. I also donâ€™t want to listen to a eulogy about how great she is when she treated me, my siblings, our kids and my Dad terribly. I also had to take time off sick from work lately due to pregnancy related issues and they were so understanding. Iâ€™m entitled to bereavement leave but I hate asking for more time off. I also donâ€™t want people at work hearing my grandmother died and being all pitying and Iâ€™ll just come across heartless because Iâ€™m upset about it. I mean I feel really weird and anxious about it but Iâ€™m not sad that she died. \n\nDoes that make me a terrible person? My brother thinks we should go to be there for my Dad, that itâ€™s the right thing to do.  And to be honest if my brother has to go back home to face all the small town gossipers, I donâ€™t want him to face it alone and I feel like we should be able to walk in there with our heads held high as we did nothing wrong. I just donâ€™t feel like honoring this woman. \n\nTL:DR: Didnâ€™t have relationship with grandmother. Not a nice woman. AITA for not wanting to go to her funeral? ",

After three months of our relationship, we shared our first kiss and it all went downhill from there. \n\nAfter our first kiss, he started wanting things from me, specifically sexual favors. He would constantly ask me for a blowjob and I would always refuse. Eventually, he would start pulling his dick out and making me touch it and pleading me to suck it. I was VERY uncomfortable with this, and he managed to convince me that I was a bad girlfriend for refusing to blow him.\n\nHe would also constantly try to touch me, but most of the time, I gave the excuse that I hadnâ€™t shaved down there and he would leave it be. Once though, I did shave before hand, because for some reason, I thought I would be ready. When he came over that day, I realized I wasnâ€™t and told him not to. He shoved his hand down my pants anyway. As. I. Told. Him. No.\nI remember pulling his hand out of my jeans and him brushing it off and smelling his fingers to tell me that I smelt good. I donâ€™t remember what any of the other encounters were that day, just that specific memory.\n\nI was really starting to get into feminism at this point, and joined my junior highâ€™s gay straight alliance. We had this event called the GLSEN Day of Silence where students were supposed to wear black and pledge an oath of silence for the day to protest against bullying and harassment of lgbt+ students. People would ask why I was joining and I wrote down a cute pie chart of how much I felt I was attracted to boys vs. girls and a title that said â€œIâ€™m Bisexual! :)â€?.\n\nThis was my first time coming out to any of my friends, and it was the first time I told my Ex. He read the note, looked up at me, read the note again, and then with the face of Joseph when Mary first told him she was pregnant, he said â€œYouâ€™re bi?â€?.\n\nWe had an argument over FB messenger on the way home from school. He told me he couldnâ€™t date a bi girl because I was more likely to cheat on him. Thatâ€™s when we broke up.\n\nOver the summer, I met someone new and started a long distance relationship with said person. I was happy with him... then the flashbacks came. I donâ€™t know why, but that memory of my ex shoving his hand down my pants started to constantly play, and I would panic attacks over it. Luckily, my new bf was supportive when I told him what happened and would even call when Iâ€™d have panic attacks so I could calm down. \n\n I didnâ€™t tell my parents that it even happened until a year after my ex and I broke up. At the end of 8th grade, I told all of my friends what happened and many took my side (but some still hung out with him afterwards)\n\nRight before Freshman year, I contacted him on social media and we had a nice conversation. He apologized for what he did to me and promised that he would never do that to another girl again.\n\nAnyway, here we are present day.\nLast night, a girl contacted me (Letâ€™s call her A) and told me that her BFF (B) is dating my ex, and she wanted to know if that was the same Ex that had sexually assaulted me. I told her yes, then proceeded to answer any questions she had, as well as tell her my full story.  \nA tells me that B has admitted that my ex does sexual things to her without her consent but she is â€œokay with itâ€? (A thinks sheâ€™s lying). A said that she gets a really bad vibe from my ex, and that she thinks that he may be doing similar things to B.\n\nThat makes my blood boil and want to confront this girl and tell her to break up with him as soon as she can because I donâ€™t want another girl to go through the same trauma that I did!\nBut at the same time, what happened to me happened when we were technically kids, and I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s my lane to sabotage his relationships. I fear that it will make me seem jealous and Iâ€™ll be known as his â€œcrazy exâ€?\nIdk, should I talk to B? Should I let her know of the monster that her boyfriend was when we were together? Have I slandered his name enough just by telling our friends about what he did to me? Am I an asshole for not putting the whole thing aside  and moving on with my life? \n\n\nTDRL: My â€œex boyfriendâ€? sexually assaulted me when we were 13 and now weâ€™re in HS and I suspect that heâ€™s doing the same to another girl even though he told me he wouldnâ€™t. I told our friends about him and part of me feels like I slandered his name enough but the other part of me wants to protect other girls from him.",

Which isn't an excuse to be an ass, but I'm kind of a cuck to my parents, probably because I hate them. But recently I did something pretty extreme.

She would break up with me temporarily and then claim anything she did was fine because we were broken up.\n\nEventually I couldn't handle it and we went our separate ways.

Iâ€™m an accountant with plans to move out and go for my masters after saving enough money.\n\n \n\nMy brother has a bit of a rough past so Iâ€™ll try to keep it short. About a decade ago, he attended a UC pursuing a major in Chemistry. He lied to our mother about his grades and he ended up dropping out due to his inability to keep them up. This left him with a big ass loan that needed to be paid off and no degree to show for it. At that point, he was forced to work retail. There, he developed a meth addiction and was diagnosed with depression. With years of AA meetings and constant support from our mother, he was able to stay sober for years and was able to find another retail job with better conditions. Fast forward a few years later, heâ€™s traded his addiction to meth with an addiction to junk food. He's a head cashier now, but has no plans of either moving up in the position, or backing down to go back to school.  \n \n\nMy brother and I used to be pretty close. During my college years, we would often bond, watch movies, and go out to eat. During the time however, I would notice things about him that would bother me. I was aware of his situation, so I tried to keep quiet in order to not upset him. One of them being that our mother would always do his laundry. He would also never clean up after himself. Heâ€™d never do the dishes. In fact, sometimes heâ€™d just leave his dishes on the counter. He never did any chores either because he would always be too tired. He's extremely pessimistic and aloof about every single thing. He's also very prideful. Whenever my mother would try to offer some advice, he would straight up yell at her. He constantly complains about how tiring his job is and claims that one day heâ€™ll quit or step down so he can go back to school despite showing absolutely zero signs of doing so. Whenever heâ€™s home, 90% of the time heâ€™s asleep. This kept up for about 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I eventually snapped at him about his behavior. It became this full blown argument which ultimately ended with him calling me a condescending asshole. Since then, Iâ€™ve stopped communicating with him. This caused me to stop eating junk food with him. After a few weeks, I lost like 10 lbs alone just from not spending time with him. This motivated me to lose even more weight. It's been a year since I've stopped all communication with him. Iâ€™ve lost around 100 lbs. and Iâ€™m no longer obese or pre-diabetic. Our mother has always been worried about me and brotherâ€™s health so she's delighted with this change. Not only that, but ever since Iâ€™ve called him out for it, my brother has been doing his own laundry and has started to wash his dishes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I a childish asshole for not wanting to speak with my older brother anymore?

Pre-kids, my husband and I had decided that we weren't going to do the whole Santa tradition.  What we didn't plan for was how hard Santa would be pushed in school (small town in an area that's 99.999% culturally Christian). Lots of Facebook posts from classmates' parents about not letting kids who stopped believing in Santa spoiling the magic for those who still believed.  The thing is, my daughter has absolutely no chill and can't keep a secret.  So when my daughter started talking about Santa and believing in him, we reluctantly decided to play along just enough to keep her from being the a-hole that \"ruins\" Christmas for her preschool class. \n\nFast forward to a few days before Christmas.  We go to a family function and within minutes of arriving my 5 year old niece tells my daughter that Santa isn't real.  Daughter asks me if it's true,  so I ask her what she thinks.  Daughter replies that she thinks he's real and crisis averted.  But later at the gathering, my brother-in-law (that niece's dad) boasts about how they don't do myths at their house.  It seems that when niece learned the truth, she wasn't taught that some people prefer to be kept in the dark.  I say nothing to niece or brother-in-law about it. After all, if I don't expect my daughter to be able to keep a secret, I can't expect her cousin who only a few months older to keep one either.

However, he wants to come and see me from Friday-Monday (i.e. going back to his college literally a day before I come down).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (gently) have told him not to come as there is no point in him spending all that time and money if I am seeing him the day after. I saw him this week already. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI **haven't** told him the other reason, which is that I also have work to do and am usually working weekends (I work 5 days a week) so this time to myself is a little rare and I would like to use it to relax before I see him.  I also am careful to maintain friendships here, as if I see him I wont be able to spend any time with my roommate and college buddies as I work so much. Meanwhile, he hasn't settled in so I think he's lonely. He seems quite upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really love spending time with him, but I don't think this is a good use of time or money.

We thought he wasnâ€™t going to make it. My sisters and I spent every night alternating who stayed the night in the hospital with him. My mom refused and would just get a hotel. Plus it helped mom knowing he wasnâ€™t alone while she processed what was happening.  \nAfter 5 weeks in the icu he was able to be moved to a rehab facility about two hours away. My sisters and I still stayed with him.\nHe is paralyzed on his right side and had lost the ability to speak. Weâ€™d bring the kids up several times a week.My mom in the mean time would go up about once a week for a few hours then go home. \nAbout three months after the stroke he was able to turn his voice on and say two or three words. Since he was making so much progress he applied and was accepted to the only brain rehabilitation centre in the province. About four hours from where we live. Which then my mom would go up once a month.\n\nFrom my dads work they continued to pay him full salary till his 65th Birthday which was 4 1/2 months away.(he was going to retire)  and they wrote a cheque for $75,000.00\nHe was able to start walking again and saying more words, my sisters and I would each visit once a week.\nWhile we were helping and stressing ourselves out financially to be there to help our parents. My mom decided now was the perfect time to go to Belize and buy new furniture and a new horse, among a million other things. ( the money was suppose to be for my dad and his rehab, making the house handicap accessible.\n\nOur husbands came into their house and made it handicap accessible on their own time and money. We took control of everything we could to make things easier on my mom. I drove the 8 hours every Friday and picked him up, My sisters would always be there to help.\nHe has severe aphasia but does ok with us.He is getting ready to be discharge him home with the help of home care and us but my mom absolutely refuses. She wants him in long term care.My mom has almost blown through all the money she received for dads care and now needs to sell their acreage. She still wonâ€™t look for a job.She plans on buying a holiday trailer so dad can never come and parking it where ever. Any time we bring anything up she cries and says we are ganging up on her.\nWould I be the asshole to give up on her and focus solely on my dad?\n\n",

As my wife and I were walking to the restaurant an older Chinese man looked in shock, pointed at my daughter and then at me. He told me â€œThat baby needs more clothes!â€? I responded that sheâ€™s fine. She was actually in 3 layers: a body suit, a cardigan and a fleece onesie. I live in the Bay Area, so it was maybe mid 50â€™s.

Even I was convinced that I was, in fact, The Asshole at first, but as the night went on I began to have my doubts.  So here's what happened.\n\nLast week a big group went out for a coworker's birthday.  We have a pretty tightknit crew at my job, and there's a big group of us that goes out almost every Friday rain or shine.  The birthday boy is a regular part of that crew.  The person who planned his birthday outing is not, but she works closely with Birthday Boy and wanted to do something nice.  She's old enough to be most of Regular Crew's mom, and is friendly enough, (or so I thought?), though can be a bit sassy.  I've never had an issue before. I like her! I still do, I think, this incident nonwithstanding.  Anyway. She plans an outing into the city to go to dinner.  She asked if I wanted to come a couple weeks before, because she wants to get a number for a reservation.  I say of course, I'll be there with bells on.  Sounds cute.  She does follow up several times, to make sure she has the right number for the reservation.\n\nFast forward to the day of the event. As I'm getting ready to leave work, a couple buddies in Regular Crew ask if I'm going to this party.  I say yeah and ask if they want to ride together.  They do. It's me and three others in my car.  \n\nWhen we arrive, Party Planner gives me side eye so hard I'm afraid they'll get stuck that way.  As the evening goes on, she continues to make a show of acting visibly annoyed.  One of the people I ride with ask me what her name is.  That's when I put two and two together and realize that the three Regular Crew buddies I brought don't know Party Planner.  They were not on her guestlist.  Considering they were already aware of the party, and that they are friends with Birthday Boy, it didn't even occur to me that they wouldn't be part of the official count.  I pull someone closer to Party Planner aside and ask if she's angry with me.  Party Planner's friend says that while she personally thinks \"the more the merrier,\" yes, it's me Party Planner is upset with and maybe I should say something. \n\nI should mention that there are probably about thirty of us here, and while we do have a private room, it's very cramped.  The waitstaff doesn't bat an eye and whips out a couple more chairs, and we all scoot in and get cozy.  But at my first opportunity, as people shuffle around and a chair opens up next to Party Planner, I sit next to her and say, \"Hey, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to throw off your plan or anything,\" and without looking up at me, all she says is, \"I'm annoyed.\"  Yes, I'm thinking, you've made that very clear. I'm kind of at a loss for words that she wouldn't just brush it off and say \"no big deal,\" and I awkwardly retreat back to my friends.  She continues acting bothered down at her end of the table, and apparently not being shy about rude she thinks I am to her friends at that end.  \n\nThe night goes on and people are starting to get rowdy.  I'm not one of the people on a mission to get absolutely twisted, but I have had a few.  I see Party Planner not talking to anyone, and I ask if she's having a good time.  She responds \"Not as good as I could have.\"  Reddit, I am shook at this point! I thought a few drinks in and it would all just be smooth sailing. Everyone seems to be having a good time but her, and do feel bad about that, since she planned this and was really excited to hang out with everyone.  But again, I don't know what to say to her response.  I'm regretting going out of my way to talk to her again, feeling like maybe I rubbed salt in a wound. I confide in Birthday Boy that I am feeling like The Asshole, and he says don't be ridiculous, he's glad the people I brought are there, and that there are a bunch of random coworkers he never even talks to there, and it would be weird if those people were invited but the Regular Crew homies that just happen to not know Party Planner weren't.  \n\nAfter a few hours, Party Planner and the other older coworkers start filtering out, I suppose because they have lives and kids and stuff.  The rest of us young jawns go to a bar down the street that has a lot more standing room, and enjoy each other's company well into the night.  I do hear from someone at some point that Party Planner left in tears.  The person who informed me of this was of the perspective that Party Planner felt neglected and unappreciated when she left.  But at this point I'm kind of over it, and think that if you're going to go out of your way to act miserable, you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to sit next to you at a party.  \n\nSo thanks for reading my long-winded ass story, y'all.

I donâ€™t tell many people that I have a disability that basically makes everything I feel extremely intense, sadness, happiness, everything. I get upset a lot because of it and I donâ€™t want people feeling bad because they didnâ€™t technically do anything so I normally never say anything. I also hate using my disability as an excuse but it is important to mention in this story.\n\nWhatâ€™s also important to mention is that I spent three months in an extremely abusive relationship prior to moving to university. I never did anything about the relationship because I was convinced that I was over reacting due to my disability and my manipulative partner told me the same.\n\nA friend of mine, letâ€™s call him weeb, knee all of the above. He was someone I trusted a lot and he knew and the insides and out. \n\nWe were at the bar and I was alone at the table while everyone else was playing pool. I didnâ€™t know how to play pool so I didnâ€™t want to humiliate myself by going up there. Another friend of mine (letâ€™s call this one memes) came up to me and asked why I was sitting alone and I explained. They said that I should come up anyway so I did. I went up and joined in on a great conversation. It was a blast.\n\nBut thatâ€™s when Weeb told me to move out of the way of the pool stick thing. So I did. Then he asked me to move more when I was clearly out of range of it (unless home runs are a thing in pool?). So he says â€œgo away, youâ€™re not wantedâ€? and he pushed me so hard that I still have a bruise from where he touched me.\n\nI got really upset by this. He knew everything that I had been through. He knew how many times I had been pushed down a set of stairs. He knew how much I was hit, and kicked and everything. He knew. I went to the ladies and I cried. I didnâ€™t want to make a thing out of it because I often over react to everything and itâ€™s just easier to hide. That way the only feelings that are hurt are mine.\n\nThen another friend came in, letâ€™s call him cloud. I was really surprised that he came into the ladies as he was transitioning. Coming back into the ladies must have been really upsetting for him but he wanted to console me. I was very thankful for that. I told him what happened and the context in which it happens (as vaguely as possible - I didnâ€™t want to name names and I didnâ€™t want to go into the exact depths of my abuse). \n\nCloud told me that I should go and speak to whoever upset me and talk to them about it. So I did... just not the way that Cloud recommended.\n\nI walked up to Weeb who was at the bar ordering more drinks with memes and I aggressively ask him â€œwas there really a need to push me that hardâ€? and Weeb says â€œI didnâ€™t even touch youâ€?. I responded with â€œbut you didâ€? and he rolls his eyes and turned away from me. I got so offended, Memes and I made contact and he had â€œoh teas gonna spill eyesâ€?. \n\nI turned away and just sat by myself for the rest of the evening. When we were saying goodbyes I hugged everyone but Weeb and I said to Weeb â€œwe need to talk when weâ€™re soberâ€? and he gave me major stink eye as he said â€œdo weâ€?. I said â€œyes we do.â€? And I walked home alone at 2am.\n\nAITA for aggressively confronting someone about something personal in front of their best friend?",

We often talk about marriage and kids and our future. \n\nWhen it comes to wedding rings, I hate the idea and the tradition. The absurdity and immorality of the diamond industry and how it became a tradition from tricky marketing makes me sick.

Sorry for ambiguous title, let me know a better one so I can improve my posts.\n\nContext: my gf (25f) and me (27m) have been together since her first year of university. I was her first sexual partner, she was my second. She had a bf before me in highschool, but they never had sex.\n\nLet me first sketch the context and then I'll get to my dilemma.\n\nThrough the years, a few things happened that pushed my gf in some kind of depression. She went out a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot. Eventually, her mom and me convinced her to go see a therapist, which helped a lot. She got through it a few years ago.\n\nHowever, during this period of depression, she got drunk once and kissed another guy. She confessed the next day, we got into a fight but I found it in myself to forgive her. She told me that part of her was sad that she never had a truly wild period because she met me so early on and this also influenced her action.\n\nAnother thing about my gf is that she can be either really passionate about friends or not at all, and that she easily becomes friends with guys. She always kept me in the loop and told me if she was feeling attracted to other guys. I also sometimes feel attracted to other girls, but we don't act upon it so that's fine. These tight friendships usually only last a couple of months after which they sizzle down, either to regular friendships or to just acquaintances. A few guys are also friends with me who I trust so I am 99% sure nothing happened.\n\nCue to last year. During the summer, she met a guy while she was on holiday while I had to work. She became tight friends, and when she got home she told me about him. During the next month, she is texting him a lot, which isn't that unusual but every time I glanced at her phone when she was near me, she would turn away or close her phone. I mentioned this to her and she claimed that she doesn't like being checked and that she always does that. I admit that I only noticed it because I was already feeling a bit suspicious, so maybe that part was true.\n\nA week or so, my suspicions had grown a lot and I took the low road: I checked her phone (I know, asshole move). In their texts, he talked about how he loves her and she talked about missing him. She said that she liked him more than she wanted, but that they could never be a couple because she is together with me and she didn't want to give up a 7 year relationship for a fling. I only read a bit since my emotions were acting up, but I am 100% sure they didn't have sex since she told him she doesn't want to. I don't actually know if they kissed, she said no but I don't know if I can trust her. We got into a huge fight, but in the end I decided to let things cool of. The fight came up again and I said that I don't trust her completely anymore, she admitted that she still regrets never having a fling or sex with another man. In the end we decided to split up for 2 months and see where we stand afterwards. Since this is such a big issue for her I don't think we'll get through it if I don't at least let her experience what single life as an adult is like. She told me I am also free to do what I want, it doesn't bother her according to her. I don't have any interest but she sounded sincere at least. I told her I don't know how I'll react and that's a risk she is going to have to take.\n\nWe are currently 1 month into the break (insert Ross gif). I am still not trusting her again completely, and I am not sure I ever will. The thing is, I still love her very much and find it hard to imagine life without her. The reason for my trust issues is that I am an insecure person and I am afraid she will either fall really in love with the guy from holiday or find someone else that she loves more than me. I know that can happen with anyone, regardless of context and history, but I can't get over this feeling it seems. I'm trying to, maybe I can someday, but maybe not.\n\nI know I have only told my side of the story. I know I am a quiet person and not very passionate about anything (just who I am, maybe autistic traits but never tested). I do try to show her I love her but she does accuse me of never coming up with or organizing something exciting. I'm not an entrepreneur while she comes from a family of self employed, I just work my job and that's enough for me. I don't really make big plans for the appartment, she usually does. I know this makes me a bit boring while  she is usually in charge of the fun stuff unless it's meeting up with friends, we organize easily in that matter. On the other hand I'm reliable and there for her when she needs me or my help. I mostly put her first when deciding on my schedule or drop plans if she needs me. Bottom line is that we both have our merits and flaws, I don't want to break her down.\n\nWIBTA for waiting for another month hoping I can trust her again or is that unfair to her or to myself? Should I talk to her about this?\n\nExtra: WIBTA for asking her to let me go through their texts again as this could be an easy way to confirm I can trust her?\n\nSorry for rambling, I'm too close to the situation to think clearly.\n\nTl;dr gf of 7 years has history of emotional attachment with close guy friends, she developed a crush on the last one. Currently on a break because she hid it and I don't know what happened between them (100% no sex though) which is making it hard to start trusting her again.

I know, it already sucks enough.\n\nI also have grown up with a huge respect for money, because I've not been allowed to have a job, so I spend the money that I get very wisely. That's why, I usually look to any opportunities to minimize family spending, meaning that I usually only ask for one expensive thing a year during that one period. That being said, if something is too expensive, if one of my parents tell me that buying that thing is impossible for financial reasons, then I've never argued with them about it.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear in a bit, I'm a decently athletic person, with a decently healthy lifestyle, and I go the the gym very regularly, though I don't enjoy exercising.\n\nNow to get into the story:\n\nI ask my dad for a set of those trendy new true wireless earbuds. The ones I request cost around $140. Pretty expensive, I know, but not out of this world costly. My dad says no, because he's ordered me an exercise bike/desk combo (yeah, seriously) that costs around $170.\n\nAs I said before, I'm a pretty healthy guy, so believe me when I say I do not need this bike. This is not a passive-aggressive push towards a better lifestyle because I'm not unhealthy to start with. Naturally, I politely tell my dad that I'd rather not get that, because for my yearly gift, I would rather have something that I actually want. I ask him to cancel the order. \n\nI'm fairly adamant about this, and my mom is on my side, and so one day my dad tells me that he ordered the earbuds. However, the ones he ordered are of much lower quality ($50) than the ones that I asked for. He orders them prior to telling me though, so I can't protest. However, he says that if the earbuds are not of good quality, he will return them.\n\nI'm somewhat peeved, but decide to give them a try. They arrive, I test them, and they're what I expected: okay but not great. I'm probably somewhat biased, but after reading reviews, it's clear that there is a significant drop in audio quality.\n\nSo, I text my dad if he can return them. Here's where the problems begin. He accuses me of taking him for granted and caring about simply the price of things instead of the feelings behind them. He claims that neither I, nor my brother (he's eight years old!) have any gratitude for him. \n\nI then explain excessively politely that I'm simply annoyed at how he always buys things first and then tells me after the fact (this has happened several times where he buys something different from what I ask, and I am too timid to speak out). \n\nThis receives no reply.\n\nI then say \"Also, about (brother). He is far too young for you to have the expectation of him showing gratitude. You can have it for me, but not for him. Please dont extend any of this onto him because he definitely doesnt deserve it.\"\n\nHe blows up and accuses me of teaching him how to parent, and refuses to speak to me afterwards, not replying to any explanations that I have.\n\nAITA for thinking that instead of buying a $170 chair and $50 earbuds, he could've simply bought the $140 earbuds and called it a day? \nAITA for expecting him to speak to me before buying stuff for me?\nAITA for trying to protect my brother from my dad's toxicity? \n\nFor the cherry on top:\n\nThe chair and the earbuds have not been returned. The earbuds are being charged and the bike has been assembled. I'm fairly sure that he's using both of them, or at least planning to. So I'm left with no present whatsoever. I'm suspicious that he bought the bike knowing he would be the one using it anyway. I'm not sure because we haven't spoken in three days.\n\nFor years now, my dad has emotionally blackmailed me in ways like this, and it always results in days of not speaking to eachother before my mom (an angel btw) convinces me to go and apologize several times to maintain the relationship. I'm beginning to think that silence is better than continuously sacrificing my dignity.\n\nHere's to the new year. \n\nP.S. The reason this is even a post is because of how convinced my dad is that he is right. Maybe there is something I'm missing.\n\n",

She is currently about 8 months pregnant. She has gestational diabetes, so she is forced to eat a diabetic diet and check her blood sugars.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, she has been on and off about eating healthy and checking her sugars. She was very busy with work and school during the first trimester, so she primarily ate fast food between classes, etc and didn't check her sugar. I didn't really find out about her diet until later on when she said she was too busy/stressed to eat healthy.\n\nI try to do everything I can to help and be supportive. I almost always have a diabetic-friendly dinner made for when she gets home and lunches packed for her. If she is out running errands and hungry, I tell her to text me before she gets home and I'll make sure there's healthy food ready for her. I also do the majority of our cleaning to keep her from being stressed. In my mind, we're in the pregnancy together, and I want to do everything I can to help keep her and our baby healthy.\n\nFor awhile, she was rarely taking her blood sugar. She was busy, stressed, and I think the pregnancy emotions were making things very difficult. After eating fast food (5 months pregnant), she came back home and I told her she really needs to take her blood sugar. She was annoyed, but took it to basically appease me. It was almost 300. For those unaware, those are dangerous levels. She took that as a reality check and started to manage her gestational diabetes better.\n\nShe finished school around 6 months. For the next couple months, AFAIK, she was doing better. The other day (8 months pregnant), she came home with fast food. I asked her why she didn't message me to make her foodâ€”she said she didn't think about it. I don't expect her to be perfect, so I just asked her to please take her blood sugar in an hour so we can manage it through exercise or whatever if necessary.\n\nAn hour passes by, I remind her, ask her if she wants me to get her supplies for her, etc. She said no she'll get it. Another 20 minutes passes, she said she is busy scheduling appointments. I told her I would literally bring it right to her since blood sugar is time-sensitive, and that her health is more important, but she needs to take it. She throws her papers in the air, yells that I'm annoying and nagging, and storms out of the house.\n\nI can see how it can be perceived as nagging, but it's not only her health, it's also our daughter's. It's frustrating because I'm completely reliant on her actionsâ€”all I can do is try to make sure we have healthy food available and ready. We had a rough last pregnancy (ended up fine and healthy). So far through her appointments, everything has looked okay, but I'm still nervous about the birth.\n\nAm I nagging? Should I just let her do her thing and not worry so much? Or is she out of line getting pissed at me?",

While it may not be much, it usually covers anything they may want to do with friends, and of course they are free to save up if they choose.

We found a bunch of receipts he left lying around after cleaning out his backpack that showed us he eats out almost every single day!\n\n\n\nAfter confirming with him that this was all true, my husband and I decided to cut him off.

They were starting to pile up and they hadn't been washed out (there was food stuck to them). I had seen an ant in the apartment earlier so I sent a message to the group chat, asking everyone to remember to do their dishes within 1-2 days to avoid bugs.

I kept telling her that uh, no, I'm actually trans, and that isn't how it works. She didn't believe me, and started insisting I see a different therapist to get a \"second opinion\" on my own gender identity. She also tried to keep me from seeing my current therapist, who specializes in working with LGBT people and who I've seen for 3+ years, because she wasn't asking these questions and was just \"encouraging it\". At one point she even considered talking to my doctor to try and take me off my hormone replacements, which I've been taking for over two years.\n\nI was a complete wreck.

I was really hurt by all of this and I felt like a huge amount of trust had been broken. I'm constantly questioning how much she actually accepts me and I'm afraid to be as open with her as I used to. Plus, she trusted the words of somebody who doesn't even support trans people over mine. She understands why I'm not over it, but she's also kind of pushing me to \"move on, it's over\".

I took Monday off to relax at home before work again. I put in this request at the end of November and my Supervisor approved it. Now, my department is made up of just me and my supervisor at the moment, as work is slow and corporate has recently deemed we didn't need to hire a replacement for a co-worker that left in October. We are the only 2 people that can do what we do, but have been able to manage with just one of us for recent vacations.\nThis past Monday, my supervisor says to me:\n\nSupervisor: I forgot to tell you! I hate BSB but I'm going to one of their concerts.\n\nMe: Oh, nice. Where?\n\nS: Hershey Park.\n\nM: How funny, that's the day after my BSB concert. Do you plan on going to the park?\n\nS: maybe saturday. My friend really loves BSB and was sad tickets were so expensive nearby so this weekend her and some friends decided to buy tickets to Hershey because they were way cheaper. And I decided why the hell not, and have a girls trip. My friends got floor seats for around $300 which i didn't want to pay so I got seats in the 300 level for around $50, but I'll walk around to visit them. I told the manager that I'll be needing that Monday off.\n\nM: Oh, well I already requested that Monday off and you approved it, so...\n\nS: I'll be 4 hours away so I don't know how I'll be back in time for work Monday\n\nM: I'll be 6 hours away, so... *blink, blink*\n\nS: I'm sure we can figure something out by then. It's 4 months away. \n\nSo after that little exchange, I made sure to go to our manager and explain that the day my Supervisor told her she needed off, I had already requested and was approved for.

Our mom got diagnosed with cancer after 6 months and 2 years later she died. I still live alone in the other country.\n\nHer illness had different effects on the both of us. I had a lot of time with my mother and it allowed me to make peace with our limited time, but my life became really hard since I had to do a lot on my own and don't have a family near me that can support me, I am over stressed and am in the process of dropping out of (high?) school.\n\nI imagine that our moms death came fast for Rachel, but her life seems stable enough. I do know that she has a lot of emotional trouble, not a lot of friends and has problems with my father (he has the tendency to always complain about our mother, hurray) but she is economically supported and is encouraged to discover the world. She has one more year to go before she finishes college.\n\nPeople always had the tendency to compare us (as any other siblings) but it was terrible last summer. Rachel seemed reasonable happy, was having fun and just generally in a good mood, while I didnâ€™t know who I was anymore, felt like a complete and utter failure and I thought daily about commiting suicide. People saw that I wasnâ€™t happy and wanted to cheer me up by pointing out how Rachel and I are the same. It only made me feel worse since the things they said werenâ€™t correct.\n\nFast forward 2-3 months, I made it a point to concentrate on myself and find my own passions / hobbies (Rachel and I shared a lot of hobbies when we were younger) and do something that made me feel like my own person and not just a worse version of Rachel. I became interested in cooking and started to experiment more. November comes and I finally find something that I really like, cocktails.\n\nI got excited since it was almost my birthday and I would finally be allowed to buy alcohol at the liquor store (drinking age here is 18 but you canâ€™t buy anything above 3,5% until 20). I am looking up ingredients, shakers, types of alcohol etc. and deciding how to collect my own bar. I spoke about this new interest / hobby / passion with my dad and he seemed happy that I found something that really sparked joy for me.\n\nSo I finally found a shaker that I liked this week but I have to wait until end of this month or next month to make sure that I can afford to order it, I inform my dad that I found â€˜the oneâ€™ and show him the picture. His reaction?\n\nâ€˜Nice, I gave one to Rachel for her birthday.â€™\n\nI have the tendency to be jealous of Rachel, since dad had the habit to treat her better than me in general when we were younger. These kind of actions don't help.\n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed of that he gave my sister a present for her birthday that I wanted to buy myself for my birthday and?  \nNote: I am disappointed that my present feels ruined, but I am not angry at Rachel.",

We really hit it off and became amazing friends- or at least that was my take on it. All my friends and even sometimes myself did have an idea that he was into me, but obviously nothing could have been said or done because of my relationship. \n\nSo I keep getting to know this guy, and started to develop some feelings for him. Things were not going well in my relationship, but I still felt really guilty to be having feelings for someone else, so I just ignored it and pushed all of that aside. \n\nFast forward to now. About one year after meeting this guy iâ€™ve been getting close with. I finally ended my relationship and have been feeling amazing. Havenâ€™t really been looking for anything. Me and the â€œfriendâ€? guy are still close and one night he started sending me flirty texts. We ended up talking about how we felt and he admitted to having feelings for me ever since we met, about a year ago. I told him that I felt something for him too. \n\nSo hereâ€™s the problem: heâ€™s been in a â€œsituationâ€? with another girl for going on 5 months now.

When I was helping her with this we both kind of talked about our problems and got to know eachother better. (Remember this for later). \n\nWell they started dating and we didnâ€™t really talk as often until around their 3 month â€œanniversaryâ€? of starting dating, when B started having some problems involving him not paying enough attention to her, kind of just not being the best boyfriend to her. Yet again I helped her out with that and we would FaceTime a lot and ended up getting closer than before, so now we both know a lot about eachother that other people donâ€™t really know about (like funny stories that sheâ€™s never told and what not).\n\nAround this time, I developed a bit of a crush on B and this other girl, who weâ€™ll call J. J also had a crush on me, so we started dating, and I stopped having a crush on B, for a few reasons (for one I was dating someone else and two I just wanted to be friends). \n\nSo yesterday B said that she has had a crush on me for a while and still does (sheâ€™s still dating K), and just said that she is really jealous of me and J, because B has had a lot of problems with K, and Iâ€™ve always been there for her. But she said that she knows J and I are happy together and that it would never work out if B tried to date me.\n\nWell I am a very empathetic person, and it always makes me feel bad to see someone else crying so I always try to help. She started crying about telling me and she felt really bad for having a crush on me, so out of empathy I said that I kind of have a thing for her too, but I donâ€™t, because Iâ€™m dating J and I just donâ€™t really like B in that way. I just felt super bad and knew it would make her happy, but it just feels weird, even though I donâ€™t like her and havenâ€™t liked for for like 2 months, even though I did like her before, and talk to her all the time still. \n\nTL:DR A girl who is taken told me, who is also taken, that she likes me, and started crying, so I told her I liked her too because I knew it would make her happier, even though I donâ€™t like her, and weâ€™re both taken. \n\nSo AITA here?",

I had earbuds in, but I took them off and she asked me to hand her a box of girl scout cookies sitting on the table. I gave her the box of cookies and she ate one cookie. She asked me if she could have another and my response was \"yeah sure, they're not mine though.\"\n\nUnbeknownst to all of us, those cookies were actually my roommate's Girl Scout cookies. In our roommate group chat, she then called me out for telling her the cookies were mine even though they weren't. I legitimately have no recollection of being asked if the cookies were mine or not until after she ate one (maybe the question was asked while I had earbuds in when I initially walked in the door and I went \"huh?\"), but they her and the other roommate that was there both got mad at me for saying the cookies were mine.\n\nI responded in the roommate group chat with \"literally fake news\" and huffed upstairs after they continued to accuse me of letting her steal my roommate's cookies. Am I the asshole for not stopping her from eating a cookie and for calling her \"fake news\" in the group chat? Or is she just overreacting and am I in the clear?",

            "input": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis did happen a few years ago but to this day it still haunts me. I met a girl at work (lets call her T), and she was perfect. We went out a few times and everything was good. Unfortunately T had to move away for school, not super far but far enough that we couldn't hang out to much. \n\nNow T and her sister (we can call the sister K) both worked with me. I was not the biggest fan of K but she was the sister of T, and i was determined to be in good graces with her, as Those two were very close.  So, maybe a week after T went back to school, I was working a shift with K and another friend (we can call him Q) the first half of the shift was fine, people pouring in and we barely had time to talk. Things took a turn when we all went on break together. I was craving a burrito and there was a Starbucks near by where I was going, so I offered K a ride since she was going there. We get back and Q is sitting there in the break room. \n\nWe sit down and Q looks at me and asks if I want to see this YouTube video of \"The Ultimate Vape\". I'm bored and have nothing better to do so I agree. We get to the point where its time to choose the flavor for the vape, and its churro flavor. This is what sets off the argument, because the man in the video didn't roll the R in churro (this is important to K because her and T are both half Black half Mexican women).  this is the conversation that followed.\n\nQ: Some people just can't roll their R's.\n\nK: That's why i hate White people,\n\nQ: ... that's kind of racist...\n\nThat's all i can fully remember was said but the events that followed were K saying you can't be racist towards White people and that's what THEIR argument was about. I considered both K and Q to be my friends but they were not necessarily friends with each other. So I sit aside let them have at it because if I choose a side I'm definitely loosing one of them as a friend.\n\nAt some point K turns to me, and she says,\n\nK: hey LexeL... I forgot my phone in my car, can you use yours to look up the definition of Racism?\n\nMe: I'm sorry K but this is between you two and id rather not get in the middle.\n\nAnd then she goes back to Q. i should mention that arguing over the Dictionary definition of racism had gone on for 3 minutes prior to this conversation. and Q had correctly said, Word for Word, what the definition of Racism was but K would not accept it.\n\nWe can skip to the end of break. I'm getting ready to go downstairs and K stops me.\n\nK: Have you talked to T lately?\n\nMe: Well I messaged her on Friday, but I know shes busy so I don't expect to talk to her until we Skype tomorrow. Why?\n\nK: Oh... well i just would expect to hear from her at all.\n\nThis interaction led me to believe that K had talked to T way before her argument with Q, and that she knew something I didn't, I spent the rest of my shift, nerves on end hoping I'd get to the bottom of this. \n\nK got off work before I did, terrible start to the rest of my night TBH. So as soon as I get off work this is the following conversation that I know by heart.\n\nText messages -\n\nT: what are you playing at??\n\nMe: Listen, idk what you've heard, who you've talked to, or what you're thinking, but I think we should talk.\n\nT: I agree.\n\nMe: Are you able to Skype tonight?\n\nT: We should just call on the phone...\n\nMe: okay.\n\nI have quite the drive home and I call her as soon as its over, we have a long talk about the situation that happened and she says that my story lines up with K's story. But... sadly I was in the wrong. Because I took no side in the situation, I actually took Q's side. \"a bystander is just taking the oppressors side without vocalizing it\" T said that she didn't think we should continue talking. We said goodbye for the last time and I never really got over it. so Am i the Asshole for not choosing her sisters side when her sister was wrong?\n\nTLDR; The sister of the girl I was seeing and another friend got into an argument about the definition of racism during break and i didn't choose a side, thus making me the bad guy in the eyes of the girl i was seeing.\n\nI wanna thank anyone for reading, even the TLDR, and I appreciate any comments. I'm just looking to learn from a past experience.\n\nThanks again!",

He has 2 kids from a previous relationship which in itself has been a huge adjustment. He is 27(m) and I am 25(f). When we initially got together he didn't mention the kids and so it was a surprise to me . Kind of a turnoff but I liked the guy so I stuck around. His kids mom is as crazy and obsessed as they come . Everything the first year was an issue because I was in the picture. She wouldn't let him see his kids ,and she'd pick and choose when and where and for how long. He would go without seeing them for months due to this. His kids are small 5 and 3 both girls, sad thing is due to all of the drama his 5 year old has the mentality of a 15 year old and carries out insults and conversations her mother talks to her about to try and cause friction. Now ironically his 5 year olds birthday is on Valentine's day . For some time his mom or sister would be the ones to contact his babymama for visits . Just recently tho his babymama said that wasn't good enough and needed to have direct contact with him or no go on the visits. It's really bothersome to me because of how toxic she is . So my boyfriend is trying his best and has begun messaging her and calling her to see his kids which he hadnt seen in 3 months. The other day I asked if he was gonna ask to have her for Valentine's to which he said yes . I gotta admit I was bummed .. things have been Rocky lately and Idk what I expected but that wasnt it. I got a little quiet with him and he got really upset and said I was being dramatic and that he sees me all the time. He also told me that he needs to be a dad and to stop thinking the way I do because its stupid.\n\n I can't put myself in his shoes as I don't have kids and I wouldn't know how to deal with this but I also feel so much pressure. I really tried the first year we were together by doing birthdays and holidays with them but I always was talked negatively about from both his family and his babymama. I got tired of trying and I stopped coming around especially because his oldest daughter would say things like \"daddy my mommy was showing me pictures of you two kissing , you love my mommy huh\" he would just tell her not to talk about those things and that,that was a long time ago ... Honestly it would get me really upset because I know she doesn't come up with those things on her own.. as I mentioned before I've been around going on 3 years now ,the other day i seen his kids and his oldest said \"hi  ohh what's your name again , ummm ,umm hey you what's your name?\" He told her stop playing you know her name and she got serious and said oh yeah I remember now .. idk why but that really got me going... Anyway , am I the asshole for wanting the Valentine's experience even though I know I'll always have to share him? ",

This filmmaker posts an ad for extras for his viking movie, and he posted it to our Facebook group. The compensation was snacks, and you had to bring your own garb and submit pics of you in it for consideration. He was also stupidly having men in Viking garb, and women in French high middle ages garb for \\*reasons\\*.\n\nI have worked in payroll for 10 years, and I'm very familiar with the FLSA (US law that regulates minimum wage, contractor/exempt/non-exempt employee status, and overtime pay). I even looked at the SAG requirements to make sure that movies were not an exception to FLSA (they aren't). I then spend the entire fucking day arguing that what he was doing was illegal. Somehow, I was \"killing his art\" and \"ruining his chances to make it in films\" and \"shitting on independent filmmaker who don't have the money of big studios\".\n\nI replied that he should fund raise to get the capital to keep up with his legal requirements. That the film company (because yes, it was a company that received pay for work) could get a loan from a bank. Or they could do a GoFundMe, or something other than wage theft. But of course, I'm the asshole for caring about the artists getting fair compensation for their art, but not about his art.  He was incredibly rude to me in front of my community.  When I reached out to his film company to inform them that what they were doing was illegal, I was rudely mocked and then blocked.\n\nSo, what he is doing is illegal.  The film company is being hypocritical, because they charge for doing film work like advertising and commercials, but they aren't compensating their extras.  I am a huge fan of the arts, and actively support my local arts scene.  But I'm also very much a fan of workers rights, and I happen to think that if your art relies on fucking over other artists than you don't deserve to \"make it\" in the business.

I don't know any other way to put it. New people are oftentimes ignored if they need help. We are barked at for not doing things while we're in the middle of doing those things. More than once I have cried on my way home from work because of how cruel these other girls could be.\n\nI thought maybe it was me so I changed my attitude from dreading going there and taking everything really hard to a positive attitude. That worked for a few days. Then, the Friday before last, I got yelled at for literally everything. \"You need to go to the dining room!\" When I was going there. They didn't need to say that. \n\nI made a very dumb mistake and I owned it but one of my co-workers threw paperwork at me and yelled at me that she wasn't doing her job because I screwed up my job and that i would have to do both. A nurse was nearby, heard this 40 something woman yelling at me, and did nothing. \n\nAfter a long day of one thing after another I got told that I \"never listen\" because I wasn't paying attention to a woman who I didn't realize was talking to me while I tried to do some paperwork on a resident. She was trying to give me more work to do when I was supposed to be going home shortly. I told her that it sounded like another shift should do that, as I was going home very soon, and she said \"well then it'll never get done!\" Which I guess is a compliment but by then my feelings were in the gutter and I burst into tears. \n\nI clocked out early against the rules and went and cried in my car because I had really tried that day not to let the bullying get to me but it didn't matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stop and eventually I broke. \n\nSo when i got home I posted this thing talking about my experience there. All of the new people who started with me also have similar experiences.  I deleted the post very quickly but a girl still took it to one of my bosses and I only found out about it last night. It really explains why different people in different departments really ramped up the bullying in the past week.

He says that if he hurts himself it's my fault. The whole thing has gotten very dark and is making me feel horrible about myself. I'm not sure what my duty is here. Like maybe I should unblock him and continue to be civil, and I'm just avoiding it because I feel he's difficult to talk to.\n\nWould you say IATA in this situation, or maybe being insensitive?  ",

            "input": "Hey guys, I know this title already seems crazy but let me explain in detail.\n\nIâ€™m a 17 year old girl who lives with my grandma and father (although he never comes home and doesnâ€™t spend any time with me) in Toronto and I have lots of mental health issues. These issues have been diagnosed by many psychiatrists and Iâ€™ve even been hospitalized for months on end because of them.  This may seem irrelevant to the story Iâ€™m about to tell you but bare with me it comes into play. BIG TIME. \n\nSo my father, we will call him Joe, he has a girlfriend whom we will call Mary. Joe and Mary have been together for around 8 months now and Mary even has a daughter who is fairly close to my age (her age being 20) and we share the same interests and mental health problems. We both have anxiety and clinical depression, her having anxiety more intense than mine and I also suffer from something called borderline personality disorder. (This causes you to have extreme mood swings and fear of abandonment issues) We shall call the daughter Mei. \n\nSo hereâ€™s where the actual story takes place. A few days ago on Saturday, Joe and I went to his girlfriends house to spend time. Me and Mei were telling Mary about how once we ordered Uber eats and both had anxiety attacks that the delivery guy was going to kill us and I had pulled a knife and hid behind the door. Joe chimes in even though heâ€™s not included in the conversation and starts downplaying our mental illnesses. He starts saying things like \n\nâ€œOh, how can you guys have anxiety! Just done give a fuck about whatâ€™s going on!â€? \n \nâ€œOh come on really? BPD isnâ€™t even that bad hahah you couldâ€™ve had cancer or something just shattttuppppâ€? \n\nGee, thanks, my anxiety is now cured. Anyways he kept saying stuff like that and it was clearly angering everyone in the room. Me especially because he kept mentioning my disorder (BPD) even though he knows it causes me to cut myself and thatâ€™s what got me hospitalized. \nSo I accidentally slipped up and said\n\n â€œshut the fuck upâ€? \n\nAt that point I knew I done goofed and instantly lowered my head. I apologized profusely and said I didnâ€™t mean to say that and that I was out of line and he laughed it off and went upstairs. The next day when we were leaving he started screaming at me in the car. He told me he shouldâ€™ve slapped me in my face and embarrassed me. I was super tired and the words went right through one ear and out the other.  \n\nFast forward to Monday. Me and my father joe didnâ€™t speak all Monday with exception of him sending me texts saying what he told me in the car but now with a twist. \n\nâ€œItâ€™s February 11th and you have until the end of the week to get another job or else Iâ€™m selling everything you own, because I bought it. Welcome to reality.â€? \n\nThis caused me to have an anxiety attack at school and I went home early. I did apply to some places and thank goodness got a call back and I have an interview on Thursday. Anyways, on Tuesday I had to stay home because schools were cancelled due to an snow storm and he didnâ€™t go to work for the same reason. He took this as his chance to burst into my room and scream at me. He called me every name in the book, he threatened to yank my piercings out my face, he even took it upon himself to yank the hood of my sweater basically choking me just so I would look at him. Mind you by that time he had already screamed at me to clean my room so I was folding clothes, thatâ€™s why I wasnâ€™t looking at him.  I started screaming because I thought he was going to hit me in my face like he said he would and I had a major breakdown. Now my grandma says that if I try to leave and stay anywhere else he and the rest of my family will cut me off. \n\nAITA for telling him to shut the fuck up? \n\nEdit: guys how I put screenshots ?? I have text conversation with my aunt and mom, I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™ll add any proof but I donâ€™t know how to use reddit .. \n\nEdit 2: hey guys I had deleted the app shortly after posting this, I honestly just needed to vent. But all that aside, me and my father made up, we talked about it. Iâ€™m fine for those who are asking, no need to worry! ",

            "input": "Ok, so I'm coming here before acting on this, but here is the situation: I live in San Diego with my wife and son at her parents house currently. We live with roommates as it's a 6 bedroom house. We rent the rooms with all utilities included, access to the pool, laundry room, and both patio areas are open for them to have late night guests. We offer them cheaper for students, as that's who we mainly attract being close to the university. In doing so we share common areas. The kitchen being one of them. I cook, A LOT, and whenever I cook, I always tell the other three people living here that there is plenty of food for them to share, and most nights they will come and join us for dinner, or at least eat leftovers. This is done out of generosity because I see how hard a lot of them work, and two of who are here from out of state and away from family. This is where the problem started, and I thought should have ended. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, I took my wife and son out to a Japanese restaurant. My wife loves sushi, and that is our treat usually once a month. My son loves teriyaki so it's a win for everyone. After eating, my wife ordered two sushi roll to take home and eat with the movie we picked for that night. So we grab the to go sushi and head home. A few hours after arriving home, we start popping corn for the movie and my wife noticed her sushi is gone. We asked around, and sure enough the only make tenant we have ate them. Actually went into the bag, opened it up, and ate her two sushi rolls. About 16 pieces. I was flabbergasted. I asked him very angrily why he would do that, and he says, \"You always offer us lunch or dinner, so I thought leftovers would be the same way.\"\n\nThat to me screams entitlement, and I am not excited that my wife's food was just taken within just a few hours of even being purchased. He obviously saw that it was not leftovers either, but an entirely separate purchase. \n\nI discussed with him that it was not acceptable to go into our possessions, whether it be food or otherwise, and to use common sense before eating anything that is not his, as I have NEVER ordered takeout or from a restaurant for these tenants before.\n\nThis brought up a discussion with the other tenants, and we discovered that one had actually purchased a mini fridge because her food would turn up missing also. When confronted with this information, the food thief admitted to drinking her iced coffees, her cheesecake, etc. Overall, not fucking cool. We told him he had 30 days from the first of this month to be out, because he violated the tenant agreement by stealing others belongings. We have to look out for those renting our rooms, so the eviction was a mutual agreement. \n\nHe argues of course, but ultimately knows he can do nothing. Yet, he now knows he has nothing to worry about with stealing food. So yes, food has been disappearing ALL week from everyone.\n\nHere is where I need an opinion. I want to buy a nice steak and leave it in my car for a couple days, then prepare it with some veggies and potatoes and leave it on the refrigerator, obviously for the food thief to eat and get sick. Is this illegal? Is there any other suggestions for me to get my petty ass revenge on a food thief in my home?",

My roommate (F, 23) and I (M, 24) were acquaintances in college and decided to room together as she had also gotten a job in the same city. Soon after arriving, I started dating my girlfriend, who I met through my roommate (friend of a friend).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is, our shared bathroom has gotten so filthy I try my best to avoid showering at home â€“ I shower literally anywhere else: my girlfriendâ€™s place, the gym, my friendsâ€™ places. After my roommate showers, thereâ€™s just a thick layer of slippery soap scum and long hair. I slipped and slided around in the tub for months before giving in and buying a shower scrubber. Iâ€™ve bought every cleaning product in an attempt to reduce the slipping risk in the bathtub. If I have to shower at home, I spend a good 5 mintues before each shower trying to get rid of the soap scum so I don't have to step in it. \n\nIâ€™ve mentioned it to her a few times, pretty passively (â€œHey, Iâ€™ve had some good success with X product for the tub, give it a shot!â€?) trying not to actively blame her for the scum, but thereâ€™s really only scum after she showers â€“ it might be the coconut oil or something. I've gotten neutral/negative response, no change in behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole for suggesting we hire a professional cleaner? My girlfriend thinks that would be really passive aggressive, but there are some other areas that could use some cleaning (kitchen, living room) and I wouldnâ€™t mind footing half the bill in order to have a clean home to return to. Part of me hopes she'll get the message and start cleaning up after herself instead. Iâ€™d like to reiterate that I donâ€™t expect her to clean because sheâ€™s a girl â€“ I clean up after myself in communal areas and just expect her to do the same (even though she makes more of a mess).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI donâ€™t want to piss her off/directly confront her since sheâ€™s in the same social circles as my girlfriend, and they seem kind of gossipy/cliquey and I don't want to do that to my girlfriend.

The problem with this however, is that I planned to make some large purchases, buying an appliance and small piece of furniture. If I had pulled through, this guy would have snugged right up behind me and when I came back out I wouldnâ€™t be able to open my back hatch/gate and load my items.

I simply replied that I needed to be able to load large items in my car and this was going to be a big shop. I couldnâ€™t have my back end blocked. He was so mad. His wife flipped me the bird and they sped off like crazy people in a parking lot with pedestrians everywhere. \n\nI guess I could have pulled right through and out into the next aisle, done like a 5 point turn and reparked in my required direction, but the lot was so crowded and I probably would have just confused another car in the next aisle while doing an Austin powers technique getting my car turned around.

We had a crazy neighbor who decided to threaten to kill us so we packed up and moved to my Mom's sister's house. Now my Aunt is messy, like filthy, rotting food on the counters, toilet unflushed, garbage everywhere, never washes her hands. She isn't a hoarder she just doesn't seem to notice or care. Her granddaughter has lived with her most if her life since my cousin died and the girl's mom is a deadbeat. My little cousin is a brat with a capital B, and as messy as her grandmother.

I will clean the place just about spotless but still there will always be something she finds fault with.

Iâ€™m now a college freshman.\n\nThis all happened in my freshman year in concert band. There happened to be a kid with autism in my class. The first day when I met him, we chatted about random stuff like football and other sport-related things. I can definitely tell without anyone telling me that he has autism, as I worked as a ilc tutor for most of middle school. I am totally fine talking and hanging out with pretty much anyone as I donâ€™t care what a person looks like as long as their actions arenâ€™t bad. Things are going smoothly, until 1 day about a quarter way through the semester he asks me a very inappropriate question relating to my genitals. I tell him â€œthatâ€™s not an ok thing to sayâ€? and everything is fine. Or so I thought. Throughout the next month the frequency of these sorts of comments increase, as do my response intensities. It got to the point where I felt sexually harassed, and I started telling him to â€œshut the fuck up and leave me alone, asshole.â€? He went away after that.\n\nNow itâ€™s at this point in the story where some of you are gonna say â€œjust tell a teacher,â€? and yes, I agree, that would be a great thing to do except since he has autism, unless he physically does something to me, the teachers wonâ€™t do jack shit.\n\nAfter I said that to him, the next day, he started saying that he was going to get me expelled from my school because I was a discgrase (bad spelling sorry). I had enough at this point so I started messing with him a little bit. I went along with his game, and every time he would say something about me being a bad kid, I would go along with it and make up stories about being a criminal. (My favorite was telling him I was a time traveling bank robber.) other than this, I didnâ€™t say anything insulting to him. \n\nOne night, after a concert, his twin brother who doesnâ€™t have any mental handicaps told me to stop messing with his brother or he would beat me up. I stopped after that and just avoided the kid entirely. \n\nI know itâ€™s been like 4 years, but this still sticks in my mind.

My father didnâ€™t particularly like his mother, and she wasnâ€™t exactly what you would call a sweet old lady, so his attack towards me specifically was not expected.\n\nI explained to him in a stammering sentence that I wanted to be there for support and since I had been the only person there besides my mom (brothers moved out), that I would at least stay and offer my very real sympathy. This didnâ€™t sit well with him, either.\n\nâ€œYou couldâ€™ve just told me the truth, and stay locked in your room like always. Had you not come down, I wouldnâ€™t even know you were home!â€? this was delivered in not much less than a choked up, grieving whisper, but was deafening nonetheless. I looked to my mother, who didnâ€™t speak, which was the right move in retrospect.\n\nAfter this, I didnâ€™t really know what to say, or if I should even say anything. at all. He broke an uncomfortable eye contact with me after a few seconds, and told me in a hushed tone to go to bed, along with an assumption that I only wanted to leave because of my selfishness.\n\nLong story short, my father wasnâ€™t mad at my predetermined lack of care for the situation, as he explained after his irrational state of grief passed. He was upset by my outwardly emotionless reaction to not just his motherâ€™s death, but really anything related to the situation. Itâ€™s not that I didnâ€™t care about my father and what he was going through. Itâ€™s just that I didnâ€™t have the strong emotional connection that my father had, or anything close to it, to display that I was in fact emotionally moved by a VERY raw display of reality in front of me. I will admit, I didnâ€™t cry or have a very strong reaction, if at all, to her death. Iâ€™m not sure why, I just couldnâ€™t find it in me to be upset.\n\nTo be fair, she was quite the grandmother. She would insist on taking me to and from school regardless if my mom was or wasnâ€™t going to, she would take me shopping for anything I needed with a seemingly endless supply of money, and wouldnâ€™t show the slightest bit of irritation whenever I broke something of hers or said something stupid out of child ignorance. Not to mention, she would fix me meals fit for an entire family. She did this for not only me, but my two older brothers, and only stopped when she couldnâ€™t breath on her own anymore.\n\nMy father, at the time, seemed to only think that I was leaving the room because I was uncomfortable being around him, and not really thinking about the fact that I just watched someone die for the first time.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not being upset from her death, and more specifically not feeling obligated to address her condition in a way that wasnâ€™t dismissive? And this isnâ€™t really asking if my dad was the offender, because he wasnâ€™t. Is there something going on with me that would justify my lack of guilt or sorrow? Or am I just an unfeeling person? I left the room because I was uncomfortable, sure. But I was 17, exhausted, and just witnessed something not many people can easily forget about. ",

            "input": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy relationship with my parents has always been strained. This is for a number of reasons. To start off in the 4th grade they left a cult, a cult I still believed in, I didn't really have anyone to talk to at the time, so I resorted to the internet to help me work through what I believed. At this point I didn't really see my parent's as a role model. They also had me during college, a decision I am certain they now both regret, so I feel partially responsible for them being stuck with a kid they don't want. In the 6th grade I was being an ass, making fun of my dads friend, thinking that neither him or I was taking it seriously, unfortunately  I didn't know I was being an dick until I heard my dad call me an ass after I left the room. This type of scenario happened again with my mom. She was complaining about me and my siblings not helping out as much as we should. I got mad and said that it was her job to clean  up after us, I know I was the asshole in the scenario, unfortunately I didn't know how much of a dick I was being until my dad came home. I heard her crying to my dad in their room, and I started feeling really bad about it. A few minutes later my dad came into my room and asked me \"why are you being such an ass to your mom\".  It is because of these events, and many little ones, that I am very reserved around my parents, I think they are going to talk about me behind my back. I also feel like I can't rely on my parents emotionally, so I have been resorting to the internet and myself for advice/emotional support since the 6th grade. This has matured me, greatly, and I would argue that I am capable of making thought out and mature decisions, as I couldn't rely on them to make these decisions for me. (as in setting rules, giving advice on what I should do, ect.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so jumping too present day. On Christmas we go to a friends house, a couple hours into the event my mom and her friend go outside to, I later figure out, smoke a cigarette.  Now I am fine with that, I have no right to judge what she does, and as long as its not a repeating thing I don't really think its a health issue. However, I am not allowed outside during this time, as she probably doesn't want to set a bad example for me. (keep in mind I don't consider them role models anymore). Later on New Years they say that we are going to the Rose parade, as they found a way to get in easily. However, we would have to go early. and I thought that after staying up late New Years eve I wouldn't have enough energy to enjoy the parade. Long story short, they forced my to go, and I ended up napping the entire time. After winter break I started independent study, and they are now worried that I will stop seeing friends, and  instead stay inside all day. Independent study has allowed me to complete other work that I would normally do all weekend, feeling guilty if I didn't dedicate every moment of my free time to this work (I am a bit of a workaholic). This weekend, now that I didn't fill an extreme amount of guilt for hanging out, I decided to take a long break, watching Netflix and playing video games with friends all weekend. Meanwhile I put off chores until Monday, last night my parents shut off my internet, telling me they wouldn't turn it on until I got my chores done. I did my chores, and, rudely, told them to turn the internet back on. They told me that I was being disrespectful and entitled, I told them to stop parenting me, and that if I could get a job and leave I would. (Though I do have experience to get a job in programming, I am also 14... so I cant get a job).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for getting mad when my parents try to... parent me? ",

Telling her I never told her that I couldnâ€™t come (bullshit) and that she never heard that I would be busy ( she went to this play and had a play bill IN HER HAND with the dates and times of the showings) and that this is important to her so I should just come anyway.\n\nWhen I told her no I could not just come because of my role and the fact that my entire graduation depended on me doing this performance (like I had told her) she called me a liar and asked how stupid I thought she was that a play would be my final. She then threw at me that â€œWell this is my third wedding so I bet you donâ€™t think itâ€™s important anyway youâ€™ll just make it to the next one,â€? and I got angry and said â€œyeah thatâ€™s exactly it.â€? \n\nI know it was petty and childish but she had pissed me off. She didnâ€™t talk to me for a while after that and to this day refuses to believe that I A) told her about the play B) it was my final C) I wouldnâ€™t have graduated if I bailed.

Those are automatically YTA material. \n\nNow she has always loved animals, which I get and I love them to, but not to the extent which she does. Animals are a lot of work and a lot of money to take care of between the food, the litter, (for cats which is what we have) replacing the litter boxes every so often, etc... Well when we first got together she had 2 cats. Fine and dandy, 2 is manageable and I like cats so no big deal. Well after picking up a few strays along the way, and not having the money to get them fixed when we should have (don't start about that, I get it, bad cat owners. Remember what I said about them being expensive?) we eventually topped off at 6 permanent cats with litters of kittens that we got rid of along the way. It hasn't been easy and its caused a lot of stress between us and to us personally but we made it through. Last year we lost two of our cats due to health complications (we got them to the vet, they were sick with feline leukemia and we had to have them euthanized for different reasons between the two of them). It was very hard on both of us but we were back down to a manageable, albeit not ideal, 4 cats. Well guess what? The only female kitten we have got pregnant again and had a litter of 5 kitten, we still have all 5 6 months later with no end in sight. Oh, and guess what? She's pregnant again and about to burst. Our last male cat has an appointment to be fixed this month and I told her outright that if he doesnt get fixed, and the kittens that are 6 months old aren't gone by the end of the month, I'm leaving. \n\nNow let me explain why, besides the ridiculous amount of stress it puts on me since I'm currently staying home and have to clean up after 9 cats, and stay up all night to make sure the kittens don't end up pregnant. When our pregnant cat has kittens again, I can see her current kittens causing issues for the new litter. The current litter likes to try to be around mom, obviously, but the mom doesnt like it, I guess because she's pregnant again. So I can see that being a problem when mom is with her new litter. I also am fearful for the health of not only our cats, but the 6-month old litter. Feline leukemia is contagious and we aren't yet sure which of our cats, if any more, have it. The longer this litter is around our cats, the more susceptible they are to the disease. Also the 6-month old litter is causing a lot of stress to our current cats, cause we simply dont have room for 9 cats plus ANOTHER litter right now. \n\nI'm at the end of my rope. She won't meet me halfway when it comes to getting rid of them. The animal shelter is very expensive to surrender them to ($100 per kitten) amd she doesnt want to post them online because she wants to make sure they go to a good home, which I understand but look what that's costing us. I left home almost a week ago to get a break from all the cats and if it were up to me I wouldnt go back, but I wanted to make it clear to her that I absolutely would be leaving again for good if the kittens weren't gone by the end of the month and our last male cat wasn't fixed.

I knew that he liked her, he mightâ€™ve known that I liked her. We never really talked about it. My friend ended up dating her for a little while. She was his first real girlfriend and they dated for about two months or so. It was in tenth grade so it didnâ€™t get super serious or anything, but it got serious to him.\n\nWhen they broke up he was really torn up for a while. I never really talked to him much about it because he never opened up to me too much, but everyone could see how upset he was. I stopped talking to the girl for a few months. The two of us werenâ€™t super close and I figured I needed to stand by my friend.\n\nAfter a little while passed I started to talk to her again. Feelings started to re emerge. As some more time passed we actually became pretty good friends and it became clear we both had feelings for her. I didnâ€™t make a move though because even though it was almost half a year later he was clearly still hung up on her.\n\nAbout a years passed since there relationship happened. My friend started to get upset with me a lot. He had a tendency to get pretty mad at people, and around this time it was especially me. He caught on that I like the girl, but rather than talking it out he started to get mad at me constantly. To be fair though, I didnâ€™t talk to him either.\n\nAfter a little while of this, this girl tells me that she likes me. I tell her I like her too, but I say before we do anything I have to talk to my friend. I talk to my friend and ask if itâ€™s ok to ask her out. He says it is so I ask her out. \n\nWe start dating and itâ€™s all ok for a little bit, but then my friend starts getting extremely mad at me constantly. He explodes and then all together stops talking to me. \n\nUltimately the relationship ends, and my friend still wonâ€™t talk to me. According to the rest of my friends, he wants to be friends again and has forgiven me. But I donâ€™t want to be friends with a person that stopped talking to me after he said it would be ok to date this girl. My friends have told me to be the bigger person and apologize. So am I the asshole here for not wanting to be friends again and for ignoring him from here on out?",

            "input": "This is a long story and it's a bit hard for me to describe the situation since there are lots if details  and I'm not going to omit info since details matter \nTL:DR at the bottom\n\nSo a little background. My work consists of me helping my dad on our own construction site. It's a pretty large construction site for the fact that there are few workers. Usually it's my Dad and an unskilled labourer. When I have a holiday I go to help him because I understand that he is working for me and my brother's future. Usually I go from 7 am-11 am (4 hours since I'm underage). In these Christmas holidays I've been going everyday except Sunday and Christmas. I didn't go for the last 2 days since I had to go do voluntary work for a school project. \n\nAnyway, yesterday I told my Dad that I didn't need to voluntary work tomorrow (which is today) so I can come to work he said he'll find me something to do. My dad pays me since he thinks that motivates me to come to work and I'm grateful. This morning I woke at 6:30 had breakfast and changed  my clothes to the concrete caked ones and rode my bike to the construction site it takes me about 5 minutes to get there at normal speed on my bike. On arrival I left my bike near the door and closed it and went inside the kitchen put on safety shoes and drank a glass of water.\n\n I went up stairs to the part if the building still being built and I found my dad and the unskilled labourer (Who was pretty new about 3 weeks) building the roof of a room. I asked my dad what I should do and he told me to take the scattered stones around the room near the buzzsaw. After, I helped the labourer take up a stone on his shoulder (about 30 by 8 inches of limestone) and he climbed onto the ladder to pass it to my dad. My dad told him not to lift it like that (from his back) and when I helped him lift it onto his shoulder again, my dad told me (in our language, the labourer was foreign) \"Has this guy never seen anyone lift a stone?\" I wasn't sure how to respond since I forgot the proper way to lift it too. Then he showed him how. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later he got a call from the guy we borrowed the material lift from that they were outside and came to get it. My dad said to me \"Already? We just have to lift these last few things and we will give it to them, go open the door for them.\" So I went downstairs and opened the door for them I couldn't see them clearly due to my -7 eyesight and me not wanting to break my glasses at work so I waved to them but when they didn't respond I taught they were the neighbours and got slightly embarrassed/awkward.  \"Come in\" I said but they must have heard \"Coming\" instead and said don't worry. I was confused so I went back upstairs and saw my dad and the labourer carrying the lift and then tying it up so we would lift it with the crane (Which was in the courtyard) onto the ramp were the truck with stones usually comes for deliveries. \"Go open the gate\" my dad said. The gate was locked from the outside so I had to go open. I opened the gate for the truck to go onto the ramp. \n\nMy dad then asked me from the 1st floor where the lift and room with roof they were working on where \"Did the truck come in?\" Why did he ask me this? Sound travels badly here so If I could hear him asking me this question he should be able to see the truck. I respond with a loud \"yes\" so that he can hear me. I went back upstairs and drove the tower crane with the lift onto their truck and proceeded to go back downstairs and close the gate. When I went back upstairs my dad asked me why I was shouting I told him so that he could hear me. He told me the I embarrassed him in front of the truck drivers by yelling and getting angry. What? He didn't even talk to them! I've been told I always sound angry which is probably true but what was I supposed to do! He asked me a question! \n\nWell whatever I brushed it off and went back to work. I started sweeping the floor off debris and stone dust into a wheelbarrow. While doing that I talked to my dad about something that popped into my head, \"I thought Noel (my brother) was coming with you guys tonight to the dinner of your friends? Is he coming with me to sleep at our grandparents? Did he change his mind?\" He then said \"Let him do whatever he wants.\" My dad then went to cut some stones in the other room with the buzzsaw. \n\nI continued sweeping the floor. Labourer comes in the room with a stone carrier and a stone on it and lays the stone on the floor.  He then stares at the ladder breathing heavily. Then after staring for about a minute at the ladder proceeds to move it to the side and also move the concrete bricks underneath to make the ladder higher. He then goes back out of the room. He then comes in with a new stone on the carrier and dies the same thing again. What? Why does he keep doing that? He didn't even use the ladder before. And instead of going round the pile of stone dust he proceeds to trample over it with the carrier and his himself. He did this last week too. This fucker. He can spend a minute staring at a fucking ladder but he can't waste a second to go round the pile I was sweeping. Ok I wasn't that angry since it happened before but I was annoyed. Whatever. He then comes back into the room with a new stone and proceeds to do the same thing minus the trample thing.\n\nWhat even is going on? I go to the other room. \"Dad, what was is it you told him to do? He keeps moving the ladder around.\"\n\"I told him to move the ladder so he can put stones instead of the ladder\"\n\"Why is he moving it each time he comes into the room?\"\n\"Every time you do this! Mind your own business, I'm in charge of him! This isn't school! Going to report people to the teacher.\"\nWhat the hell! Last time I did this was 5 months ago when a different labourer kept staring about and doing nothing when he could be doing something! \n\nI got the wheelbarrow I was filling with stone dust and debris took it to its room. I put my broom and shovel in the storage room and went downstairs. I checked my phone it should be 9 at least by now right? 8:20 and a missed call. It was mom, I called her back\n\"Honey, ask dad if he opened the garage so that the maid can come in and call me back with his answer\"\n\nSo I went and asked him.\n\"He said yes mom, also in coming home early\"\n\"Isn't there anything to do?\"\n\"Not really, bye\"\n\nMy dad always told me if you don't want to be here you can leave I'm not forcing you. I never did leave early since when I started in June since I felt guilty, even in days where it was 35Â°C and I was stuck driving the crane. \n\"Dad,I'm leaving\"\n\"Bored already?\"\n\"Yes\"\nIn my mind I rationalized there was no crucial work to be done and I would end up wasting time.\nI already felt terrible for leaving work early because i felt entitled and thought it would be awkward later today when he comes home.\n\nWhen I arrived home I heard Mom in her new office talking in the phone. Then I realised it was dad.\n\"What's going on?\"\n\"DAHunter go get your laptop down here you're not allow to use it\"\n\"What? Why!\"\n\"Dad has been telling me how you yelled at him in front if the construction workers, reporting your brother and reporting the labourer!\"\nI couldn't help it, I yelled at her\n\"WHAT THE HELL HE IS MAKING STUFF UP I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT\"\nShe then got off the phone, my mom has a problem with stress and I felt bad for shouting.\nI then proceeded to explain my side if the story.\n\"DAHunter, you're racist! You always go report anything the labourers do wrong just because they are black!\" \nWhat has that got to do with anything?\n\"I don't hate black people mom! I hate idiots!\"\n\"That doesn't excuse you embarrassing your father!\"\nShe then shouted from across the house \n\"Noel! Get off your computer and come do your homework!\" (Noel is 12 and that's not his real name). \n\nI then went to take a shower for about 20 minutes. I still can't see what I did wrong. Maybe from their point if view I did something wrong because I'm easily angered. My shout sounds angry, My dad thinks I always pick on my brother even when he is not there and apparently I'm a racist and can't stand people. Sorry this was so long but I wanted as much if the story here since I'm not sure during which moment I was an asshole in.\n\nTL:DR My dad got mad at me at work for yelling and apparently embarrassing him and asking him what the hell the labourer was doing. I went home and he called my mom with a version that was to me, twisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This included $50 that was being sent to my sister monthly toward her ministry (she's a missionary/ my husband is an agnostic,) and a $300 phone bill that included my husband, his parents, his sister, and her boyfriend (including, phones.) \n\nWhen I met my husband he was living with his parents but wasn't paying rent so it made sense that he contributed to expenses by paying the phone bills. At the time his mom wasn't working, and his sister was in college and had never worked before.\n\nI'm close with his family, we get together a couple times a month and for the most part get along well. However, there is certainly a cultural divide. The family is from the middle east, it's not unusual at big family gatherings for my FIL to call out my husband, in front of his extended family, for being cheap. Which I know bothers my husband, though it doesn't push him to change our spending habits. His father can be a generous person, it is not unusual for him to decide in the moment to drop $100  for everyone's dinner. \n\nSix months into the marriage, my SIL had her birthday and her dad surprised her with a brand new I-Phone. During the party my husband looked troubled, I kept asking what was up and he would just shake his head, \"Not now.\" On the drive home he took out his phone and checked our phone bill. My FIL had purchased the phone through our account, adding a payment plan. We were both furious, we turned the car around, my husband and he argued, and I completely lost my temper. When his sister found out, she was embarrassed and offered to return the phone (which my FIL refused to pay for,) neither my husband nor I felt right about that, so we dropped it. \n\nWe have now been paying for everyone's phones for two years. We have lived on our own the entirety of that time (I've had my own place since I met my husband.) My MIL has been working for a year. My SIL graduated and now is working a fairly decent job. Her boyfriend is also working but in retail. All of them live together with my FIL. \n\nMy husband suggested they begin to pay for their own phones in a month's time and the shtf. My SIL said straight out, \"No,\" like it was her decision. It was the most uncomfortable week ever. Their arguments were that it was family obligation, and that because individually they make less than us (everyone but my FIL,) that we should continue to pay.\n\nWe were holding firm in our decision, then my FIL got injured at work and went on unpaid leave. So we backed off, because that would have been messed up, and helped out with their electric bill. But, now he's working again, and I want to move forward with our plan. My husband has lost the desire to though, seeing his father in a weakened state has left him unsure of what to do here. I can get waiting but will this ever happen, should this ever happen?

Our relationship started off a bit strange and we did things that people who arenâ€™t just friends should do, but both of us knew it wasnâ€™t serious and it was never like super over the top or anything. I joined pretty late in the semester though and didnâ€™t realize that Michael was close friends with a girl named Amy.\n\nAmy was dating Ben, but I quickly found out that Michael was desperately in love with her. They were best friends and always talking and he fell HARD for her. She would tell him that even though she was dating Ben, she and Michael were meant to be together, that she was in love with him too, that they would get married right after college. Michael, meanwhile, kept attempting to convince her to breakup with her boyfriend so they could be together finally. It was a shitshow and Amyâ€™s boyfriend was aware this was happening the whole time and would mock Michael about it constantly. There was also a lot of evidence that Amy had two boyfriends (not Michael, it was another random guy outside of our university), but Michael was blind to it and supported her 100%. Anyways, eventually it became obvious that Amy was just stringing Michael along to get a higher position of power within the club. I convinced Michael that Amy was toxic for him and that he needed to cut her off and he agreed, although he didnâ€™t really want to and Amy ended up leaving the club. \n\nA couple of months later, he called me and told me that Ben and Amy had broken up and I told him I was really concerned because I knew they still talked sometimes and he told me that he just wanted to be there for her because he had experienced a similar breakup in the past, but that there was no romantic feelings between them still.\n\nSure enough, a couple of weeks later I find out that theyâ€™ve started dating. I know sheâ€™s no good for him whatsoever and frankly, Iâ€™m tired of having to deal with all of the drama she brings to Michaelâ€™s life. Thereâ€™s a lot more details about why I just donâ€™t support this relationship or really want to be friends with him while heâ€™s dating her, but these are the most major reasons. I sat him down and told him that I was going to quit the club for a while because Iâ€™ve become more busy with schoolwork and that I think he and I should stop hanging out or talking. I never specifically told him it was because of Amy, but I think we both know it is. I feel like shit because he seemed so crushed and even started crying, but I absolutely refuse to clean up after his relationship with her anymore and watch him suffer while heâ€™s with her. She might also still have that second boyfriend. So, AITA for cutting him off like this?\n\ntl;dr: Best friend is now dating a girl who we both know is super manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive. She might also have a second boyfriend.

The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids donâ€™t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friendâ€™s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if Iâ€™d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hourâ€™s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom canâ€™t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and thatâ€™s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean Iâ€™d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didnâ€™t care about the kids, Iâ€™m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.

Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

I donâ€™t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses.

Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr.

At the time I thought this was an OK idea, he'd get a car that would last us the next 10+ years, and even if he had a rough month, the bonus would cover most of the payment without really affecting our remaining budget.\n\nFast-forward to now, my husband left that job. It was a toxic workplace, I fully supported him leaving. However, his job prospects would make him significantly less than what he made before.\n\nBasically I crunched the budget, and even if he lands a job on the optimistic side, I'd still be taking a majority of the costs over in order to afford this car. We would also have zero money for savings. He's made it very clear that he wants to buy a house together in the next couple years (his big dream, I don't mind renting), with this car that simply isn't going to happen.\n\nHusband keeps saying he can \"make it work\" but I'm looking at a budget where I'm covering 75% of the household needs and it leaves us with maybe $70 extra per month if we are strict as hell. There's just no way we could save enough for a house at this rate.\n\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for telling my husband if he wants a house in the next couple years, we need to ditch his new car?",

Found out my dead father isn't my father, it's my godfather who is estranged to us. My mother actually made him my godfather *because* she knew I was biologically his. I suspected for a decade but didn't know till I got the test\n\nBefore my bio father became estranged to us he had a son with his girlfriend. I met the son when he was a newborn. The girlfriend left with the son to another state and my bio father left us to be with her a while later. Didn't talk to him for over a decade. We still don't really talk and I found out the girlfriend became his wife and they're now completely separated. They had two more kids and he's not allowed to see them, so I can't even speak to them through him.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to look the son up since I remembered his name and realized he'd be a teenager. At one point my bio father, who lived with us at the time, was going to seek custody of him. So for a few months I anticipated this kid being my little brother.\n\nShockingly, the kid looks *exactly* like me. His childhood photos look exactly like my nephew. My sister is also my godfather's, we knew that for sure 100% for years. She took her own test and it says we're full siblings. I showed my friends and therapist his photos from his Facebook and they thought they were old photos of me with long hair. We're almost twins.\n\nSo, yeah, the kid is 16 now. He has his own Facebook and Instagram. \n\nI messaged his mother on Facebook to ask her permission to speak to him months ago. I wrote the letter with my therapist and was cordial and delicate considering the circumstances. She never responded. I was heartbroken but understood. \n\nMy mother brought the kid up the other day and said she knows I'm probably sad that I can't have a relationship with my two little brothers and sister. I told her I was going to wait till the youngest is in their 20s before reaching out (that'll be in 10 - 12 years). She said the oldest is 16 and she thinks he's old enough for me to at least PM him to introduce myself.\n\nI'm super conflicted. I don't know this kid and I don't know if he can handle something like this. On the other hand, 16 is old enough to understand. At the end of the day I want him to decide whether he wants me in his life or not, not his mother. Obviously, she can decide that for right now, but when he's an adult he can choose on his own.\n\nMy mother disagrees and thinks 16 is fine. She's under the impression that he probably wouldn't tell his mother and just talk to me. I wouldn't want to do that, however. I don't want to burn bridges or cause unnecessary issues with his mother. \n\nFamily is super important to me, especially siblings. My sisters and their kids are my best friends. Would I be the asshole if I PM'd him despite his mother indirectly telling me no? Should I wait till he's 18 or in his 20s?\n\nAdvice? Has anyone been in this situation before?",

I only have one issue with my bf, and it's that everytime he compliments me, he calls me \"hot\".\n\nI know that this is a really stupid thing to bother me but I got 2 reasons why I dislike it. The first being that I think it is a sort-of objectifying term, and it makes me think that my body is the most important thing to him. I would much rather him call me \"pretty\", \"beautiful\", or \"cute\" because I think those compliments take my personality into consideration. I feel kind of uncomfortable if he sees my sex appeal as my defining trait. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the thought behind the compliment and I find him really attractive too so I try to compliment his looks aswell. But the term \"hot\" seems to only focus on my body and sex appeal, and not to sound like a stereotype but I want our relationship to be deeper than that. (Another important note here is that me and my bf haven't had sex yet)\n\nThe other reason I don't like him calling me hot is because my ex used to use that term constantly to describe me. My ex coerced me into sex on two occasions before I found out he actually had a girlfriend who he was cheating on her with me. He used to get me incredibly drunk and then take advantage of me in some way, thankfully we only dated for a month. I never really realized it was an abusive relationship because he seemed so loving towards me, he constantly called me \"hot\". I remember specifically he would say \"you're so hot you're making me so hard right now\" to hint that I should give him a bj. I was 18 at the time and really wanted to save having my first time with a guy I knew really well and I wanted the relationship to be deeper than sex. Anyway the word \"hot\" was his go-to compliment and that's why it triggers me a little lmao.\n\nAnyway so I've been planning the next time my bf calls me \"hot\" to explain my reasons to him and ask him to use another word. I'm afraid it's gonna sound like I'm picky or ungrateful? I'm sorry if this is too small of an issue for this subreddit btw",

The overall allergy doesn't manifest as an usual cat allergy - I can be around cats, what really triggers asthma and allergy for me is dusty environment.\n\nSince I want to move in with my bf, who is from a neighbouring country with a totally different language (its Hungarian, with I understand only a few words), I have problems to find a job suitable for me - no work experience except a part time job and translation/ language related Uni aren't helping me much. At my bf apartment, I get less of allergy symptoms even if he owns 2 cats partly thanks to having a normal bed. At my parents' apartment, I sleep on a pull out futon sofa, which wasn't really build for every night sleeping on - the pull out part is wood with thin foam on top, which got worn out quickly and isn't comfortable anymore + the whole sofa is covered in cat hair collecting textile, it doesn't matter how much you try cleaning it you can't get rid of all the dust and cat hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't happy with the futon for a long time, hinted to my parents for at least 2 years that I would need a better and proper bed and they tried to compromise by buying a thin mattress to put on top and an air filter for my asthma that I have constantly running next to the sofa. Both helped somewhat, but my asthma always got back a month or so after. When I sneeze, have a runny nose and cough for several nights in a row and have to take meds and inhaler to just be able to fall asleep and feel terrible in the morning,I manage to get a big grumpy when parents don't seem to care enough, bring in more saved stray cats (have 5 in total now, but we have a big apartment so cats are doing well, no overcrowding) and tell you to just do sports outside, while the allergy doctors are alarmed my lung capacity dropped so low.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month I caught a cold that concentrated on flooding my lungs with slime I was coughing constantly and not getting any air when trying to sleep. The only place I could sleep was closing myself in the bathroom and sleeping on the floor with a yoga mat under me. Parents bought me a sleeping air mat, which didn't survive longer than a week, even if I tried to not let the cats near it. After the worst part of the cold went away I evacuated to my bfs appartment since my asthma still was extremly strong but I still need to get back to my parents place once in a while sice all my doctors (allergy, dentist...) are there.\n\nI still can't sleep on the futon since that cold, even with meds and parents refuse to buy me a new bed stating I can buy me one from my first salary (my parents are well off if they wanted to buy a bed its not a problem).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven my bf can't sleep on that bed well (back problems) and started to have his own first signs of allergy there.",

A friend and I hydroplaned while entering the freeway on a roundabout, which caused the little Yaris we were in to slide into oncoming traffic. We got broadsided by a semi-truck. Amazingly, we both walked away unscathed, with the exception of some back pain on my part.\n\nIn the days following the accident I had an amazing outpouring of love and affection from my friends. People brought me food, family from out of state called to check in on me, and one of my college TAs was even cool enough to drop by with some edibles to help with my back pain.\n\nTwo days after the accident I got a message from my friend Eliza asking if I wanted some company. I said yes, and asked her if she could do me a huge favor when she got here and take my trash to the dumpster. I live in a second story apartment and getting down the stairs with a bag of garbage and a bad back just seemed like a monster of a mission at the time. Eliza says of course, and everything is set.\n\nCue to a few hours later and I'm lying on my couch being stoned and pathetic. I hear a rattling at my door and in walks Eliza, who I fully expected, but she also had our friend Wren with her, who I did not expect. Wren can be a bit much in a lot of ways.\n\nAfter greetings Eliza jumps into cleaning my kitchen, which I appreciated, but I kept trying to tell her that all I needed was the trash taken out. Eliza didn't listen.\n\nI had a basket of unfolded laundry sitting in my living room. Wren jumped right into folding that. Again, I kept insisting that she did not have to do that, and again, I was ignored. At one point, she pulled a pair of my underwear out and I immediately was like, \"hey, I don't like other people touching my underwear. Please stop.\" Wren took this as an opportunity to just chuckle, then proceeded to tell me a story about the first time she went to our friend Willowe's house and how she started cleaning and Willowe was uncomfortable and visibly angry, but Wren just kept going and how she could see that same discomfort in me and how she thinks it's funny.\n\nThis didn't sit well with me. Who the hell gets off on making their friends uncomfortable?\n\nSo I told Wren straight up that she needed to stop. I said I get that she's trying to help, but honestly, I'm sore and high and feeling really violated, which is mixing with my high and giving me this weird anxiety that I really don't like. I kind of snapped. Both Eliza and Wren felt the mood change, so they both left after that and said they were going to let me rest.\n\nI've spoken to Eliza since, but not Wren, and honestly, I don't want to talk to Wren. I don't think it's out of line for me to set boundaries and I don't think it's okay to intentionally cross someone's boundaries, even if it's in the name of \"just trying to help.\"",

I warned my friend that if he wanted to buy games then he would need to make his own account, so I wouldn't have to worry about reimbursing him for anything. Lo and behold he bought two games; one worth $20, and another worth $60. Of course, I was pretty livid, but I said I'll try to reimburse him for the games to the best of my abilities. My friend has not touched it since then, but recently asked me to reimburse him for the $60 game since I just paid him back for the $20 game. I literally had a mental breakdown because I barely have the money right now to pay back for those games since rent/utilities/etc has been kicking my ass. I confided in my boyfriend and he told me I don't need to pay him back in full; I just need to pay him back with a key.   \n\n\nI felt super guilty about it since I feel like I'm scamming him, but my boyfriend had reminded me that I had warned him about buying games on my account, and that it's not fair to me for reimbursing games that I'm not going to touch unless I'm actually interested.   \n\n\nI had asked for the receipt for the game, but he had sent me a screenshot of the first time he had bought the code. I asked where he had bought the CD code and he said amazon, and then someone else bought him another CD code for the same exact game through amazon again. And right now, there's a sale on it for $35.99 on steam. So I told him I could have just gifted me a new key for cheaper, but now he's giving me excuses about how someone else had bought the code for him and amazon doesn't do refunds as well as not providing me with the more recent receipt.

            "input": "Throwaway because I'm curious and don't know if the couple uses reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the backstory: I own my home and in order to help with costs and savings I rent out the rooms in my home. I won't get too into details about this but recently I have been struggling financially for external reasons so having room mates has become a must. I have a three bedroom home, and typically only ever rent out one other room which is across the house. I live in a fairly nice upper-middle home in a quiet and safe neighborhood. I keep the place clean (I clean thoroughly once a week, I dislike messes) and all I really ask for in return is that payments are made on time and that you are kind to me and my fiancee. The rental agreement I provide is just a month-to-month agreement and it is fairly generous and lenient for the person renting the room. I do my best for background checks, personality checks, financial reviews, and etc. prior to accepting people in. The room costs typically $600 a month with a $350.00 security deposit which I return after inspection. This amount includes the monthly rent, internet, utilities, and pretty much everything minus their personal expenses. I do ask that they not let my two kittens outside (they're indoor cats) and that if they're going to use something (like plates or laundry detergent) that they just ask in advance - I'll likely say yes. For reference, the typical rent in my neighborhood for a room is about $1200, or $1800 for a one bedroom apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo due to recent financial struggles I had agreed to let a couple live with me. I figured I would give them one room with a discounted rate (Instead of $1200 for two people, it's just $800) and I would agree not to rent the second room while they are here (which means I'm earning less per month since not both rooms are rented). They did advise me they would have March as their last month as the girlfriend is pregnant and the baby would be due in late March. This was in November. I felt for them and wanted to help, and additionally I really needed the money at the time as my previous tenant had to leave on short notice (He was really nice though and we worked it out amicably, although at my financial burden).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially everything was fine but we started noticing many issues. They would drink and eat our food without asking. They would use stuff without asking. At one point early on we found one of my favorite cups was being used as a cup-holder for their toothbrushes under the sink in the guest bathroom. The girl (who is pregnant) is leaving cigarette butts outside my home and she also spends her time drinking on my patio and leaving her mess behind. They tamper with my thermostat and cause my electric bill to increase by about 60% (when I typically account for about a 40% increase with new tenants). Additionally, they started using my garage and extra room as storage despite being advised not to. I had to confront them on each issue and they pushed back either saying it wasn't them or they wouldn't do it anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I'd be furious but I wanted to best assist them so I let them have these extra luxuries at no expense because it would be easier than arguing - and I also couldn't find new tenants to replace them despite my many efforts.\n\n  \nFast forward to today, the rent is due and they advise me they are leaving in two weeks and they only want to pay for half the month. Now our agreement in no uncertain terms says they need to give me a 30 days notice and they owe for the remaining thirty days. I attempt to be nice but before I can text a reply the boyfriend sends me a huge insulting text message saying \"We are leaving because you neglect your cats and they have fleas. We should've gotten a thirty day notice on the fleas and we can't live like this so we deserve to not pay you the full rent.\" Later on he agreed to pay the full amount and \"we will discuss prorating it later\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my kittens are everything to me. They're indoor cats. Me and my fiancee spoil them. Recently (as of about 15 days ago) we discovered a flea problem. Immediately we notified them, bug-bombed the house, brushed them, shampooed them, gave them anti-flea treatment and they came back again as of yesterday; so I intend to get in contact with an exterminator to see what options are available (as they may be in places I can't get to with conventional means).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ended up being a longer post than I intended so I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom, but am I an asshole for demanding they pay the full rental amount as agreed by on our contract - and even more - I provided them official thirty day notice as of today to vacate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I accepted a pregnant couple into my home with a month-to-month agreement. They're trashy people and I've been nothing but kind while they drink and smoke on my patio together. Today they asked me to only pay a part of their rent and leave early, violating our monthly agreement which puts me in a rough financial spot.",

Then the teacher picks a random sheet from that group to grade and bases the entire group grade on that paper.\nSo obviously it makes the most sense to all get the same answers.\n\nThe groups were assigned.\n\nI am definitely not an A+ math student. By far. But I really do try and in this project I was trying to pull my weight. This group was 3 kids besides me who all knew what they were doing far more then me. I eventually get far behind them and start asking for help and then because our time to work on it is almost over, answers.

I had an ok relationship with my parent who I donâ€™t live near, lets call them parent #2 but it was a very stressful. My parents split was very messy and parent #2 alway tried to make it a pick parent #1 or me and was always pushing to spend every moment with them. I understand that they just have me and my sibling, but I also had to deal with the burden of constantly making me feel like I was guilty for any decision I made regarding time spent with parent #1 or parent #2. Parent #2 also argued that they didnâ€™t have to support me if I didnâ€™t see them enough and since the day I turned 18 even when I still saw #2 on an almost daily basis they did not support me financially. \n\nAfter moving I was basically pressured into visiting once after only 3 months even when I had a visit planned for about six months out. Well not parent #2 wants me to keep up a 3 month routine and honestly I donâ€™t want to see #2 that often. #2 just always makes me feel like crap and pressures me into things I donâ€™t want to do. Now donâ€™t get me wrong I still like #2 but its just shitty to be pressured to do everything. They act like they give me options, but I know that the options arenâ€™t really options. Iâ€™d be more than fine if #2 wanted to come visit me, but Iâ€™m tired of flying across country and taking off time (over a week each time) from work every 3 months. When I split my time almost 50/50 between my parents life was hell because I had to constantly listen to the bickering. It wasn't everyday, but it would got to the point of me having to leave the house a couple of times out of fear or anger. There were many good times during those years, but many taxing days as well.\n\nTo understand my situation a little better Iâ€™m a full time student and work 40 hours a week so Iâ€™m busy, but I like it and still want time to do my own things. I guess I might be selfish, but at this point I donâ€™t know. I also donâ€™t want to disagree with parent #2 because there parents have a college fund for me that will pay for a half of year, which is a lot of money for me. It almost feels like I just have that pressure of money looming over me. Plus I still love a lot of my family on that side, but its just tough because I donâ€™t want to upset them by making parent #2 upset and they wonâ€™t see it my way, they never have but they donâ€™t hold it over me.\n\nSo I ask, am I the asshole for not wanting to see #2 every 3 months? Also should I good see #2 or should I stand my ground?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go way further in depth with the stories, but I don't want to be too specific.",

To be clear, I am not smacking or talking through food in my mouth or chewing with my mouth open -- your face just naturally makes some noises when you eat.

This has always mildly hurt my feelings, but I also can understand the irritation factor, so I have mostly just dealt with my feelings about it and moved on.\n\nLast night, we were sitting on the couch.  He was reading, and I was watching a show with headphones.  I was eating a snack while I watched, and he tapped me so I would pause the show, so that he could tell me, \"You are making the most disgusting noises ever while you eat that.\"\n\nI got so annoyed, and I slapped on a phony smile and a syrup voice and said, \"You make the most disgusting noises every time you eat too; you just don't know that because your wife doesn't feel the need to humiliate you each time.  It's called graciousness.\" Then I put my headphones back on and went back to my show, but I was too self-conscious to continue eating my snack, so it just sat there.\n\nHis whole mood changed into a sulk, and he thinks I am the one who is an asshole.

They must have knowledge of someone that they fan of, like their birthday, their real name, their songs, etc. It's because if someone has the interest of a topic, they will have the curiosity to learn the topic further because of how interesting it is. It is simple logic, I suppose.\n\nUnfortunately, my friend is having anger because of it, calling that if I were having a debate with that type of reasoning, then I will be boo'ed.

They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves.

Person B just gets furious and starts insulting Person A.\n\n\n\nI jump in to try and cool him off, since Person A has changed quite a lot since high school, but Person B isnâ€™t having and of it, and tries to cold-clock right Person A in the face. I end up just tackling Person B to hold him down to try and cool him off. After he calmed down, I let him go and he curses us off, then leaves. He still hasnâ€™t returned my texts, and he made it apparent that our friendship is over.\n\n\n\n\nSo who was the Asshole here?",

She has this friend (J) that about 3 years ago, down in Mexico, got drunk and started talking bad about my wife (then my GF) in front of strangers the entire day and then at the end of the night, got into a physical altercation with my wife.  My wife called me at like 2:00am from Mexico, crying, told me what happened and said she was driving off in the rental car to get to the airport (she left J in the hotel room) and was coming home.  The entire way back to the States she kept calling me upset, etc.  J was also going through a divorce at the time because she got busted cheating on her husband with a coworker, who she also gave herpes to.  My wife has known J for 20 years.  J is also in her 40s.  \n\nAfter the Mexico thing happened, my wife told me she was going to cut J out of her life because she didn't need toxic people like that around her.  I thought this was a wise move.  My wife hasn't heard much from J over the past 3 years but has received the occasional reach out, \"I'm sorry\" type of text to which she replied politely to but never more than that.  My wife has said, when she chooses to shut a door, it stays shut.\n\nSo, a couple of days ago, my wife runs into J at a store and J starts crying and saying how sorry she was, etc.  My wife tell me this and I can only say that I don't like J but ultimately it was not really my thing, it was between her and J.\n\nMy wife got very defensive and said I wasn't supportive and that I only know bad stuff about J (which is true) and that we have all done stupid things like J did in Mexico.  I said yeah, maybe when I was like 21 or something, sure I may have gotten drunk and gotten rowdy but even then I don't remember cutting my friends down to make me look better and then fighting with them and I sure as hell don't remember doing anything like that in my 40s.\n\nI said from what I know of J she is unstable, selfish, toxic, mean, etc and I don't think she has a place in my life but if you want to give her a chance, that is up to you, just don't expect me to like her because I don't.\n\nThis turned into a major fight with my wife about how I should be supportive and how I don't really know J.  I told my wife, \"up until a few days ago, you thought the same way I did and only changed once you ran into J\".  \n\nI'm not sure what my wife wants from me.  I don't think many mid 40s women act like J did.  I don't want any drama or crazy around my wife or kids.  I can understand how J has good qualities as well but I just don't have a good vibe about her, even less so now that J is single and doing God knows what.\n\nNow, my wife thinks I'm an asshole and all I was really trying to do was be honest about how I felt.  I haven't changed my mind, I still don't like J and I think she is trouble but I will try and be supportive of my wife for my wife's sake.\n\nAITA?\n",

Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.",

            "input": "Sorry in advance for formatting, Iâ€™m on mobile. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI have a friend who lives down the street. I met him when I was 13 and he was 15. We were extremely close and most of the things I enjoyed were because of him, (Basketball, Volleyball, Card Games, Some Online Games), but thats besides the point. A little before he turned 16 he got his first car (â€˜99 Honda Civic $1000) that was perfect except for how it looked. We often went places and I never â€œmockedâ€? him for having a bad / old looking car because in my eyes it was perfectly fine for a car. \n\nFast forward by about 2yrs heâ€™s 17 and Iâ€™m around \n1 1/2 months from my birthday. He worked hard and got his parents to agree to price match a new car for him. He put $1800 in for a â€˜07 Mustang ($3100) and his parent matched him with the extra going towards the small bit of needed fixes. I was extremely happy for him and even joined him when he drove to go to repair places to get the standard new car fixes like oil changes. The only real problem with the car was a slightly bent hood, something you couldnâ€™t notice from more than 10ft away. \n\nFast forward a month and now its 2 weeks before my 15th birthday and since I know my family didnâ€™t want to pay much for my car I was expecting something basic similar to my friends first car. Since I have to drive 40 miles to and from school everyday when I get my license we has to get something with low miles and high mpg. While I was sitting in my room doing nothing my mom knocked on my door and told me to come outside. What was waiting there for me? A red â€˜02 Camaro! ($3200, small paint problems and a few things needed replacing but no major problems). I was so happy and excited for my permit so I could drive but the first thing I did was text my friend saying I got my new car and to come over.\n\nI heard/saw his car coming up to my house but instead of stopping, he just drove right pass. It confused me a small bit so I asked my dad if he could drive me to his house with my new car to ask his opinion but when we go in front of his house we saw him get out of his car (with his brother and friend, both I know semi-well) and walk right past us into his house. I was kinda bummed knowing that he was mad but normally he gets over things after a little while so I let it be and texted him 1 week later about going to a volleyball open gym that we normally go to. These are the texts.\n\nMe: You going to volley?\nHim: Maybe why?\nMe: Bc Iâ€™m going and wanted to know if youâ€™re driving\nHim: Well why donâ€™t you drive? Youâ€™ve got a nice new car.\n\nThis was before I got my permit. \nThe rest of the conversation went similarly with him kinda saying things that made it sound like Iâ€™m a huge asshole and was getting mad about how my car was a little more expensive and that I didnâ€™t work for it. Eventually I told him that when he got his car I was happy for him so now he should just grow up and be happy for me.\n\nThere was another point when he said that my parentâ€™s buy everything for me which other the my first good pc (Christmas 2015 ~$1000) I have bought anything over $50 by myself. Ex. Oculus Rift, Xbox One, PS4, PS4 1TB, my current computer specs (~$1300), my shoes (totaling ~$260), my 3ds xl ($120) and pretty much anything over $50. The only times I get something is during my birthday/christmas which even then never go above $200. He get things given to him worth the same to more than I do. Ex 2 pairs of nice shoes after getting honor role on a report card.\n\nIf you couldnâ€™t tell by that rant this is what really got\nme annoyed and stop texting him. I havenâ€™t talked to him at all since (4 months) but whenever I think about it I get really annoyed. I understand where heâ€™s coming from, he had to work but I didnâ€™t, but he doesnâ€™t have to treat me like everything is my fault. \n\nThis is the story but the question is, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My parents payed for my first car that was around the same price as my friendâ€™s 2nd car that he price matched with his parents to get. ($3200 against $3100 split 2-ways). Now heâ€™s mad at me.\n\n",

I know stories involving abuse are touchy here because it usually falls under the 'validation seeking' post category, but I swear I've thought this over. I'm never this divided when it comes to my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My mother was abusive so I stopped reacting to anything she did, but recently I've caught myself becoming more and more cruel towards her, to the point that when she said she just wanted to die, I asked her why she hadn't. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background: my mother has been abusive as far back as I can remember (so, since I was 7 years old.) It went from degrading my physical appearance to attempting to kill me a few times. I'm not blind - I know what she did was horrible. I'll never forgive her for it. \n\nHowever, I've been acting like a real piece of shit the past couple days, or maybe even weeks. She's been trying to be nice ever since I ran away a month or so ago, I can tell, but apparently that just makes me more angry. She hasn't been too abusive in a few months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the actual story. Two days ago, I was in my room, getting nothing done as usual. My mother comes in, obviously wanting to talk about the meeting she'd had the day before with my maths teacher (about me missing way too many classes and my grades dropping.) She asked - in a sweet voice that made me want to punch her in the face (goes to show how weirdly I've been reacting these days) - why I'd been missing those classes, listing off potential reasons. I'd had a less than ideal day, so I just wanted to be left alone, and I got annoyed really easily. I snapped. \n\nUnfortunately she just cranked up the whiny tone. Started talking about how hard this was for her (which I get, honestly, but in that moment I wasn't hearing it), and eventually she said the magic words \"I want to die from how tired I am because of you.\" \n\nI was too mad at that point to watch my mouth so I just asked her \"why not do it, then\" in a complete deadpan. I wasn't looking at her so I'm not sure what her immediate reaction was, but when she next spoke I'm pretty sure I heard choking up. \n\nI felt nothing in that moment. That's what makes me so conflicted. I didn't even think in that moment, I let myself go and stooped to her level. Said the words she used to say to me. Afterwards, thinking it over, I felt bad - not for her, not really, but for having been that much of a shithead to anybody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two entirely different parts of me that are at odds right now. Half of me just wants to dismiss it - I want to tell myself that I'm not the asshole, that I'm justified because of what she did to me before. But the other half is reminding me that no matter what, it doesn't change the fact that I practically told someone to kill themselves. And she's been trying to do better, I'm just actively making it hard for her. That's definitely asshole material. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I need help in figuring this out. I don't care about the verdict, I just need to know so that I can try to change whatever I may need to change. Thank you :)",

Sheâ€™s currently struggling with bipolar disorder so her feelings are easily played with and to top that off sheâ€™s just recently gotten out of a two year abusive relationship (mainly extreme verbal abuse) so Iâ€™m a little protective to say the least. \n\nAbout a week ago she got herself a girlfriend, I didnâ€™t know the girl personally but some friends of mine told me sheâ€™s nice. I had this horrible feeling in my gut all day, at first I thought I was just being cautiously protective but after talking to my sister Iâ€™ve realised Iâ€™m very jealous. I feel absolutely terrible since itâ€™s kinda like Iâ€™m cheating on my girlfriend in my head but mostly because my brain basically wants to keep this poor girl to myself without ever cutting ties with my gf. Am I a complete asshole for having these feelings?",

He acted like a fool in public, yelling obscenities even on public transportation. At first, it was a minor inconvenience, but after time it started to wear on me. A month or so in, I started letting him know that I didn't want our friendship to be impacted by our roommate situation, and I could use help maintaining the apartment's cleanliness, which he essentially ignored until I had a breakdown about the communal areas being absolutely filthy to the point I couldn't bring anyone over without cleaning for several hours.  \n\n\nI have since been rewarding his good behavior with dab oil (we're in WA state, totally legal) and hot fresh meals, since I know he hates cooking. When he trashes a room and leaves it that way, I just ignore his mess and keep cleaning my own, while making food simply for myself. Once he's cleaned, I make a nice big communal meal for the both of us, almost always complete with fresh baked desserts. While he's in the shower, I drive to the dispensary for oil and dab out when he's done. I even slip his bus fare back into his change from food stores when he's not paying attention, if he hasn't been cursing and obnoxious on the bus.

            "input": "So, some backstory first. This will be long, very long, I apologize. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy dad has always had terrible anxiety that he never bothered to treat for a variety of reasons. He is terrified of public transit, high winds, pit bulls, crowded spaces, so many things, and it's a very legitimate fear to him. Sometimes he seems to know his fears are irrational, but that doesn't stop them. This has shaped my childhood in many ways, for example I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license until I was 20 but also not allowed to ride my bike anywhere farther then a mile away, take the bus, or ride with any but a few friends of mine he trusted. Growing up with these restrictions and fears turned me into a bit of a nervous shut-in. At 22 I started to get very sick, we later found out I have multiple sclerosis. This ramped his anxiety up to a new level and also ensured I would be living at home with him for much longer. During this time my parents took care of everything I needed, even though I could barely move. Medical care cost them more then I can ever pay back and they don't even want me to pay them back. I am very grateful. \n\nMy boyfriend of the time understood I needed extensive care but was also going crazy living at my parents' home, so he invited me to live with him. My dad didn't allow it but I left anyway. After a few months he understood and accepted it. It helps that my then-boyfriend now husband is a wonderful person and my dad loves him.\n\nA few years later he had his first heart attack. This ramped his anxiety up again but also prompted him to finally accept treatment. Sadly, he stuck with the first medication he was given and it only works a little bit and he left his first counseling session in the middle and refuses to return. Still, his anxiety went down for a while and our relationship started to flourish. I even managed to have a few conversations with him about his overzealous restrictions. \n\nWhen I was 29 four major things happened: I got unexpectedly pregnant (surprise! You're not infertile!), something horrible that is a different story left my fiance and I effectively homeless, my dad had a second and much worse heart attack, followed by open heart surgery, and my MS went into remission. All of these things sent my dad's anxiety spiraling out of control. He can't sleep, he has lost way too much weight, he doesn't eat much, and he is well on his way to a third heart attack from anxiety alone! But he will not have the doctor look at his anxiety medication or return to counseling. \n\nMy husband and I frantically searched for a place we could afford to rent that we could move into right now and would allow our pets and actually found the perfect place... directly across the street from my parents' house. It won't be so bad, right? Plus, it's not like we could find another place like that on such short notice. We knew we were wrong when my parents cornered our new landlord and managed to convince him to give them our keys. Naturally, they made copies of every single one. We very excitedly prepared for our baby, and I started moving around and getting out more, realizing how hard life can be when you are unable to get out at all. We learned that I was capable of caring for a child with a few accommodations in our home but still not able to hold a regular job and I became a stay at home mom. It didn't take long before it was glaringly obvious I could not raise a healthy child shut in the house, so I learned how to use public transit. \n\nNow, I am 33 and married with a healthy, very active, and not remotely anxious four year old son and another son due in March. I am mostly blind and my MS has returned, but it's not as bad as it was. I am very familiar with the public transit system in our city, and it's not a bad one. My dad is retired and spends most of his time watching our house from his kitchen window. He calls me to ask where I am going and ask me not to go there every single time he sees me heading anywhere, even the grocery store he wants to come with. Everywhere non-essential he tells me not go. If he had his way, his grandson would never go to the park or public pool. He regularly goes through my mail and even more regularly lets himself in my house, where he proceeds to fiddle with my thermostat and simultaneously lecture me over a mess that usually doesn't even exist and also lecture me for \"pushing myself too far.\" My son thinks his grandfather is the best thing since ice cream and I don't want to separate him but he is starting to avoid some of his favorite activities, such as digging in the dirt, because his grandfather told him it is too dangerous and this is infuriating me and potentially harming my boy. \n\nFor a while I would compromise by staying home about half the time he asked me or asking him to drive us instead if it bothered him, but this only made my dad more upset and he started to do things such as hide my stroller or \"borrow\" my cane to make sure it was very hard for me to get anywhere. Keep in mind that I may now be a grown and married adult who takes care of myself and my own with an involved and loving husband, but the idea of telling my parents \"no\" terrifies me and I just can't bring myself to do things that will probably burn bridges with them, such as changing our locks or reporting my dad for tinkering with our mail. So now I just take the longer path out of our neighborhood, trying to stay in the blind spot I know my parents' kitchen window has, pretend my phone is broken and sometimes doesn't ring when he calls, and go wherever. I guarantee my son has benefited from seeing more places and getting out to play more often, and I have benefited as well. My dad however, gets nearly apoplectic. I have tried to talk about it, but he asks me to \"compromise\" each time for his sake, but there is never anything for me in his supposed compromise. I know this is making him nervous and paranoid and putting his heart at risk, but frankly he would be nervous and paranoid anyway. \n\nTL;DR: Life makes my dad nervous and he wants me to never do anything ever, he watches me to make sure I never do anything. I recently realized I am an adult and can ignore him so I do stuff anyway. Turns out I like doing stuff.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for ignoring my dad's anxiety and not staying home with a rambunctious preschooler, even though it could possibly help him avoid a third heart attack?",

She said stuff about not wanting to raise a child as a single parent (I'm a single mom, so that stung, but it's not my life) and planned on going through with it. Sadly, she ended up miscarrying. She was upset but, I think, somewhat relieved. Life went on. About a year later, she met another guy who was also Bad News, in and out of drug rehab and halfway houses, definitely not relationship material, but she jumped right in with him and quickly got pregnant. This time, she admitted she wanted to get pregnant, planned it, and wanted to keep the baby.

He was having a lot of mental health issues, including dissociative identity disorder, bipolar, and others. It became clear that he was not fully able to be in a relationship with her because of his issues with drugs and mental health. Once he went back to rehab and my friend realized she was alone, she decided she wanted to get an abortion. This time, I was shocked.

Fred will shave and leave a ton of hairs all around the sink. He will use my bathroom stuff and I'm a woman. He refuses to clean. He's never once cleaned the bathroom, living room, or any other place. He smells like BO and leaves weed and ash and roaches everywhere. Instead of taking the garbage out, he will stack trash and leave us to take care of it. \n\nThe last straw was when he got sick from what I'm pretty sure was norovirus (aka stomach flu). I was in the living room yesterday morning and he was on the couch.  He gets up, stumbles through the hallway and throws up all over the floor. I immediately think \"uhoh\". \n\nI tell him to try and stay away from the living room so we don't get sick. He doesn't listen and hangs out in the living room. He cleans his mess but left his trash outside near the front door in a plastic bag. I told him to leave my dog alone and not pet him. He didn't listen, so now I can't cuddle my dog. He's also not washing his hands. \n\nSo I'm in the bathroom with bleach, gloves and a mask desanitizing everything (which I get, because he wasn't in a condition to clean). I've done EVERYTHING I can to stay away from him. I am not eating in the house, not anything. I threw away my toothbrush just in case particles got on there while he was puking his guts out. \n\nI came back from class today and put on my mask. He irritatingly says I don't need it as if I am overreacting. He says it was \"food poisoning\" and to not worry. If he knew anything, norovirus can be food poisoning and that's incredibly contagious. He's getting irritated with me and tells me I act like his mom because I tell him to clean. If I get sick I am not going to let him live this down.  \n\nAnd I'll probably move out. I know norovirus is really contagious and even the most clean of people get it, but if I get sick from HIM I think I'll be too disgusted with him to look at him. Just imagining him stumbling into the hallway with heavy feet and puking all over the floor like a child makes me sick. If I get sick I know I'm going to really go off on him. \n\nAnd I mean yell. I won't be able to control it and I'm going to blow up. I need to know if this makes me an asshole. I can't take it anymore. I honestly want to just land a big fat punch right on his face because he is always trying to get in fights (he got into a fight with my friends once and broke his nose). \n\nTL;DR my disgusting roommate (probably) got norovirus, isn't sanitizing anything and is heightening the chances of get me sick and I want to go off on him so badly after this last straw. \n\n",

It was by no means always harmonious, but we always thought our relationship was worth fighting for. Iâ€™m not a greedy bitch when it comes to money. I stayed with my parents and the first time I truly lived on my own was when I moved in with him a month ago.\n\nMy ex is absolutely awful with money. He spends it frivolously on eating out, alcohol, and before I encouraged him to get clean, drugs. But he is also a hard worker. When we got more serious, I started being a bit controlling and speaking up about his spending habits because he was always broke. Before we lived together, I helped him with rent on multiple occasions. I would have done anything for him, and if I had it, he had it. I admit towards the end I started being resentful because I felt like I was almost at time taking care of HIM when I wanted him, the guy, to take care of me...\n\nFast forward, our relationship ended abruptly and it got nasty. So much pent up anger and feelings reLeased. The only month I lived with him (first week of March), I paid my entire check from a new job I started. $900 (not a lot) of our $1200 rent. Unfortunately I was fired the very next day (no regrets, was being sexually harassed at work every day.) He paid the rest, but he didnâ€™t have enough to pay half because he started working a new job after me. I moved out after we broke up and now Iâ€™m demanding he pay half of what I paid for the rent, $450, considering Iâ€™m in a shitty situation (No savings, but I did manage to get a job I havenâ€™t started). At first, he said he would help, but he of course spent money on partying for ST. P. I asked him yesterday when he was going to pay me, he said he couldnâ€™t give it to me in full because he has court. \n\nWhen I tell yâ€™all Iâ€™m fucking livid!! I feel absolutely used. He has a great job now and I feel like he truly wonâ€™t pay me back because he has no self-awareness and truly doesnâ€™t care. Part of me wants karma to play out and just leave it, the other part of me wants to hit that bitch up every day until he pays me back.\n\nSo AITA for demanding the rent money back?

She is sweet, but she is a little off. Overall, she doesnâ€™t like people. She will come out and snuggle with you when It is very quiet and you are typically laying on the couch relaxing.

We dated for 2 years and his drinking became too much for me to handle so i moved out in May. We stayed friends. A few weeks ago we had sex because I missed hanging out with him and he had mentioned he wasnt drinking so much anymore, gave me some hope that we could try again.  But afterwards he told a girl we work with that we were having sex again. She in turn told at least 5 other people that I know of and suddenly everyone is asking me if we are dating. So, normally this wouldnt be a big deal, it's just gossip. But when we had sex the condom slipped off and I had to go get Plan B to ensure no preggers would happen. I also think he posted something publically about us having sex, in snapchat or something similar, because the day after i went to PP some rando on the internet posted an ad for prostitution services on my page. It's very catholic in my area, lots of prolifers who think women should be punished for having control over their reproductive organs. I assumed the prolifers found out and were trying to shame me for going to PP. After this happened i became deeply concerned that the local PP had shared my personal info, violating a HIPAA, and was going to report them. But when I started hearing people from work talking about me and my ex, my next assumption was that  it was my ex who had told. I confronted him and he admitted he had drunkenly told our mutual coworker. That was 2 days ago. Then yesterday he sends me a text saying it wasnt her, supposedly he was so drunk he doesnt remember. Obviously starting this relationship again before knowing more about his sobriety status is my fuckup. I accept that. But would i be the asshole for breaking things off with him specifically because he talks about our private lives openly? He says I'm the one who has broken his trust but I dont see how. ",

It's not like I got used to it or anything, I just fuckin love flowers and think it's a relatively cheap way to show your appreciation. I dont want 18 premium Rose's. I simply want anything, and I work at a store with a floral station, so I see every arrangement from $3-150(financially, he shifts from really well off to scraping by like bi weekly, so obviously I'm not expecting flowers on a bad week.. but if you go on a $400 tool spree and cant find it in you to buy flowers for ur gf...). I also see guys buying beautiful flowers for their girlfriends all the time. \n    I've kind of mentioned it before, I've told him what my favorite flowers are, and when the flyer comes out I'll say something along the lines of \"oh look alsros are on sale this week!\"its been almost 2 years and still no flowers. Not for birthdays and not for the last valentines day we spent together. Also, my birthday just passed, and I HATE to sound ungrateful, but he just went to a store nearby that, admittedly we both liked, and the gifts are beautiful, but I can tell by the proximity and how random they are that it was an afterthought and he had NO plan to get me anything. He also bought me a bottle of gin that, not only had he showed distaine for in the past, but I'm super sensitive to alcohol and he knows that I only drink 1 thing, and it definitely isnt gin. With that, there was no card or nothing, just a pile of gifts in a grocery bag. \nSo here's the real question... I was gonna wait till the day after valentines day,, and if still no flowers, I'm going to buy myself a bouquet,  a nice one, that I like. AITA? it's not so much to guilt him as it is to remind him that i like flowers, and valentines day is a time when people buy their gf flowers. I just feel forgotten about,, meanwhile I'm waiting a month in advance for any gift giving holiday cause i cant wait to show him how much i appreciate him. We both come from relatively poor backgrounds, and its ingrained in me cost shouldnt be the drawing feature in a gift, it should show that you truely know and appreciate that person. I'm not doing this because I think I deserve flowers, I just think he forgets that romance is an important aspect of our relationship to me. AITA? ",

He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday.

Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; heâ€™s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place.

My friend explained to him that it wasn't about the meal, the parents just wanted to know him better and that they could share the cost together (her siblings can also help with the burden by not coming). Heck, just coffee for 2.50 in total for the parents as they talk over coffee will do.\n\nHe reply was that, HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND HIS MOTHER'S MONEY, EMPHASIS ON THE MOTHER.

Ever since we started dating about 4 months ago, itâ€™s only gotten worse. We frequently have movie marathons at my house but they almost always get cut short by her mom sending her a text like â€œBe home by 9â€? on Friday and Saturday nights, saying things like how my GF needs sleep, among other reasons that donâ€™t really add up. My girlfriend obeys her mom without any argument, and I get her home at the specified time, no questions asked, but this has happened for so many dates in a row that Iâ€™ve started believing her mom just doesnâ€™t want her spending time with me. \n\nI didnâ€™t say anything until today after my girlfriend texts me saying she needs to cancel our next movie marathon that we planned days ago because her mom decided today that itâ€™s going to be a family day, which was kinda the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back, per say. I asked her if her mom didnâ€™t like me, I got a kinda flakey answer, which make me go into a bit of a rant about how I felt that her mom didnâ€™t trust me, was making up random things to cut our plans short or interfere with them entirely, and how I felt rather insulted by it. My girlfriend didnâ€™t really say a whole lot other than her mom wouldnâ€™t change so I would have to learn to deal with it and that I canâ€™t take is so personally, at which point I apologized because I realized I was bothering her.\n\nThroughout some more conversation I apologized repeatedly, and my girlfriend said it was fine about 4 times until she finally said that she didnâ€™t like me talking shit about her mother like that, that it really bothered her, and that her ranting about her mom is different because itâ€™s her mom.\n\nWeâ€™ve resolved the fight and it led to some very healthy discussion, but Iâ€™m still wondering AITA? On one hand I feel like the asshole for basically making my girlfriend choose between what she saw as shitting on her mom or arguing with me, but I donâ€™t feel like I insulted her mom, only that I felt insulted that her mom doesnâ€™t seem to trust or like me. So tell me reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR - GFâ€™s mom consistently interferes with my plans with my GF.

            "input": "So this past summer I (M 22) was looking to  buy a new car and upgrade from my first car Iâ€™ve had for about 7 years. To not go too far into detail about it, my dad got involved in my new car purchase and coerced me to go against my better judgement and buy this 2006 bmw that he found online for about the same price instead of the one I had picked out and was going to buy (2007 Volvo S60 R) which, might I add, was in perfect condition. When I looked at the bmw it seemed to be in decent condition apart from some obvious problem areas that I knew would need to be addressed (new wheels, appeared to be an oil leak, needed new driver side headlight) which also gave me a bad feeling in my gut. long story short I end up buying the bmw cause my dad went ahead and out some of my money in as a down payment for it (he likes to eat involved with things). \n\nOk so fast forward about 6 months and I have so far sunk about 2000$ into this car on necessary fixes that turned out to be big repairs (Iâ€™m still kicking myself in the ass for buying this money pit). One thing in particular that still hadnâ€™t been fixed was the driver side headlight. The problem with it was that water had been able to leak into the headlight over years and years causing the clear plastic to be permanently cloudy and also messed up some electrical components which caused the adaptive headlight not to work (turns the lights left and right when going around corners and is a very intricate assembly so canâ€™t be fixed with a simple bulb replacement). Since I donâ€™t have a lot of money being a recent grad and am only working an entry level job, I can only make the repairs once I save enough money and the whole replacement OEM headlight assembly would cost about 5-600$. \n\nAlso for a side note Iâ€™m big on doing things correctly the first time and of course Iâ€™ll try to save money when I can but I will opt to spent the extra buck when something really counts and needs to be done right. \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago my dad gifted me a replacement headlight assembly so I could save the 500$ for something else. The other day I took the old one out and tried putting the new one in. First I hooked up all the plugs to make sure it worked but there was one plug that didnâ€™t have a spot to connect to. I looked closer and realized that these were not the same kind of headlight. The main difference being that the replacement did not have the adaptive headlight assembly inside it and was just a regular bulb (the light from the replacement was yellow and much dimmer than the original passenger side light that was white light) On top of that, the holes for the screws didnâ€™t line up right with the frame and required a little persuasion to fit. Also on the original thereâ€™s a separate arm piece that clips into one corner of the headlight and then is screwed into the frame. The replacement had the spot where the piece sits in but not the part where it clips into the headlight itself so it sits in the opening loosely. Without this arm attached, the headlight wiggled around. So now Iâ€™m thinking that the replacement is just a cheap knockoff. I told my dad about the light and that as much as I really appreciated his gift I canâ€™t use it cause Iâ€™m worried about it coming loose or breaking (being as that it wouldnâ€™t be completely mounted and the material felt very fragile) and he acknowledged. So I figured Iâ€™d just take it out and put the old one back in the next day as I was running out of daylight and didnâ€™t feel like fiddling with it anymore (kind of a pain in the ass to get it in/out) \n\nThe next day I get up around 10 cause itâ€™s a Saturday and Itâ€™s the only day I get to sleep in. When I go downstairs my dad tells me that he was able to get the headlight mounted correctly and that he fixed it. When I go out I see that the arm is attached to the frame on the spot on the light whereâ€™s itâ€™s supposed to be. I look closer and I see a big crack in the side of the opening where the arm sits and super glue all around it (looked like he forced it in and it snapped). Then I see a big smear of superglue that dripped off the arm area onto the front of the headlight onto the clear plastic that had been partially wiped but looked like it was wiped off a bit too late and managed to dry. So now not only can I not return the replacement headlight because itâ€™s damaged but Iâ€™m pretty much stuck with it. I told him that I appreciate him trying to help but as much as I tried to not get mad I got pretty upset at him doing things to my car without my knowledge. \n\nAITA for trying to give my dad back the gift and getting upset with him about him â€œfixingâ€? the replacement and rendering it nonreturnable?",

Around a week ago by mom asked me what my shift schedule was for the week, I replied that I didn't know yet (because I had not checked, not because it wasn't out). She told me she wanted all of us (my entire family) to attend church with her that Sunday because it was a Christmas event, and they were providing dinner after. I never clearly told her no, I didn't see harm in going once because I stopped going to church with her regularly a couple months ago, it was fine as long as I wasn't working.\n\nSkip ahead a few days, and I did turn out to be working Sunday, but I was scheduled an hour after lunch. At this point, I decided I wasn't going because getting from the church to work would be too rushed, and I didn't want to be late for my shift. I told my mom what time I was working, but never told her no when she said \"you'll still be able to go\" because I knew that would ultimately end in an argument. \n\nWhen Sunday rolled around, my dad woke me up and I said I wasn't going because I'm working. He said okay and walked away. About a half hour later my mom knocked on my door telling me to get up because I'm going to church. I said no I'm working, it's going to be too rushed getting from the church and eating (there are assigned tables + line ups), and she yelled about it being \"family time\" and there was no reason for me to not go, and then said if I didn't go she would take the internet for two days. I said whatever and went back to bed.\n\nLater when I woke up and got ready for work, a couple minutes before I had to leave I was looking for the keys to drive and couldn't find them anywhere. I started to panic, and texted my sister because my mom and dad were not answering their phones. She said \"sounds like mom took the keys.\" And she did, and I had no way to get to work. I had to reluctantly call my manager explaining that I couldn't come into work because my mom took the keys, which he replied \"thanks for telling me\" and then said it's law (here) to call in at least two and a half hours before if you can't come in. I said I didn't know what to do, and then hung up. \n\nSo I ended up staying home, absolutely pissed off and upset that my mom took away my ability to go to work (I had already called in twice that week because I was sick). I decided to play games because if I'm not working why not, and when my mom came home she immediately took the internet. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if a) she hadn't already taken the car keys, and b) it takes away my ability to talk to my LDR boyfriend, as we can only talk via social media app (I don't have data), which she knows.\n\nI went up to her and said we needed to talk, in which turned into a screaming match between my parents and I. They said there was no reason I couldn't of went, and they only asked me for two hours of my time, in which I told them (also yelling) what I had said earlier about being rushed, and how it was unacceptable how my mom reacted. My mom told me to shut up and go to my room. I did, to calm down, and then about an hour later went back and apologized to her that I didn't go, and asked if we could talk again but like civil people. I then explained how I felt and why what she did upset me so much. When I finished she said \"I already told you everything I needed to\" and then got up and left. \n\nAITA for not going to church with her when it meant so much to her, and then getting so upset when she punished me?

I asked if 60 days (notice we have to give apartment leasing company and term of rent that needs to be paid) was enough time for her to get a new place? She said yes- I also offered to put in the 60 day notice later, effectively buying her more time to search for a place as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, I told my RM I think we are about to go under contract on a potential home and that SO and I would pay for any termination fees and of course our portion of rent/utilities during the 60 days. Asked RM if she needed more than 60 days to find a place, she said no, she was planning on moving into a 1bd/1bth in the same apt. \n\nOn Thursday the home deal fell through and we are back on the market so I informed our RM that we were back on the search. She said that she was planning on going to the leasing office tomorrow to sign a contract for mid April for her own place. She asked to be let out of the lease and obligations here as she wants to just get the move over with. I discussed with SO and we agreed that we could cover her portion of rent starting May. I inform roommate we would cover her portion of rent beginning May, but that she would still be responsible for her portion of March &amp; April rent/utilities, to which she agreed.\n\nYesterday RM goes to the leasing office to sign her lease. I get back home from work and calculate out how much her April rent/utilities are and inform her for the power bill I would let her know once I got the bill. She responded back 'ok'. 15 min later, I get a text from RM who said she doesn't think its fair that she should have to pay rent for a month that she wont be here. She gets home &amp; she informed me that she signed a lease for mid March for her own place, because the leasing office offered her a \"better deal\". I asked her wasn't she planning on moving mid April, why did she sign for mid March? Her response was because of the better deal and she wanted to just get it over with. I told her I would need to discuss with SO and see if we could let cover her portion of rent for April. I point out to her that even if SO and I closed on the house, everyone would have had to pay the apt for the 60 days of rent (March &amp; April) for the apartment.\n\nAfter much discussion, SO &amp; I agree that it's unfair for us to become burdened with her portion of rent for April just because she wanted to move out earlier and signed a contract without informing us.

Instead of paying rents for a stranger (the owner of my sister's house), I could've used that money to help them with their current house. \n5. Since they can't speak or read or write in English, I'm the one that's been helping them with all of their documents, letters, mails. They believe that if I move out, I won't be there to help them anymore. \n\nSo, the people of reddit, please tell me am I the asshole for wanting to move out? I understand that they gave me the opportunity to have a higher education, but do I owe them for the rest of my life? Should I just live with them until I get married (they believe that it's the legitimate way to move out) and then move out? ",

He made an antisemitic joke on the day I met him and when H told his mom that those things canâ€™t happen again the guy  ignored me from that point on and he never apologized. He also has this hobby of taking pictures of people and sending the pictures out with ridiculous photoshopped effects and fake backgrounds. \n\nSo fast forward to my wedding, H and I told them beforehand that we would prefer them not taking pics. So what happens on my wedding day? The guy competes with the photographer, shadows what she is doing, and remarks that they should compare pics to see who was better.  He then sends out the pics he took to everyone before the professional photo did and he photoshops the backgrounds and it looked like we got married at glamour shots in the mall. My dad gets pissed because he isnâ€™t in the pics and said I look like an orphan. I tell them to please stop sending those pics because I would prefer the ones that I paid a professional to do. MIL gets offended.\n\nLater on MIL tells H and me that her now husband thinks we donâ€™t like him. We are honest and say weâ€™ll he made a Jew joke and then he takes pics when we said not to. She said everyone else was taking pics, which was true, but they were not intrusive, didnâ€™t follow around the photog and didnâ€™t send out pics like they were the real photographer.  \n\nMIL ended up crying.

However, the location (a gas station) is somewhere I go daily (and, that I used to work at a couple years ago), so I know that, despite it being a college town, there are quite a few regulars who are... quite old, and might need the spot. Also all conversations are as best as I can remember it. There was more interactions than just this, but for the most part it was repeating the same beats. Capitalized words are raised voices.  \n\n\nI am pulling into the gas station behind another car. The car ahead of me was turning, as the only spot left open by the doors was the handicapped parking space (he would go on to park at a pump, as did I. There were still 3 open when I walked inside). However, he was forced to slam on his brakes as a car zipped in front of him and into the handicapped parking space. It wasn't an illegal move, nor was she speeding through the parking lot... but it was definitely rude.  \n\n\nWhatever. Not a big deal.  \n\n\nI park at a pump and head inside. While I go in, I notice that the rude car didn't have a handicapped plate. I double checked that she had indeed pulled into the handicapped parking space before peeking into the car to see if there was a hanging handicapped sign on the rear-view mirror (my late grandma would use one when she went places with my mom) and also notice that the girl in the car seems to be a peppy young thing couldn't be older than 30, but was probably in her 20s (I'm a 28 yo man, and she looked young to me). I shake my head at this point, disappointed that someone was taking a spot at a semi-busy gas station for a handicapped person, when it seemed there was nothing wrong with her.   \n\n\nI figure it's none of my business and head inside. As I reach for the door, I see \"Deb\" the manager, heading out. I hold the door open for her. We exchanged pleasantries and she went on her way, stating that she was out for the night.  \n\n\nSo, once inside, while I was checking my pockets (I forget my card a lot, so I was making sure I actually had it before I got my purchases). At that point, I felt a pair of spindly arms wrap around me from behind, with painted fingers laced around my chest. The hugger (lets call her Kate, for simplicity) is holding their head against my back. I tense up and state loud enough for the entire store to hear:  \n\n\nME: \"I don't know who you are. Get the fuck off of me.\"  \n\n\nShe complies, stating something about how I should smile more. Because I look like I'm always pissed. (more context: I'm generally seen as a pretty happy guy. I talk jovially with the employees and customers alike. I also have a penchant for having full on conversations with people that I meet at this station). I respond:  \n\n\nME: \"Yeah, normally I get pretty pissed when morons steal handicapped parking spaces.\"  \nKATE: \"Are you a cop?\"  \nME: \"No. I'm just not an asshole.\"  \nKATE: \"So, do you see anyone who needs it, huh?\"  \nME: \"Nope. But that doesn't mean there wont-\"  \nKATE: \"Then whats the problem? There was nowhere else to park!\"  \nME: \"I can see THREE PARKINGS PLACES out ther-!\"  \nKATE: \"THERE'S NOWHERE TO PARK!\" \n\nME: \"THERE ARE PARKING SPACES, if you aren't a BITCH!\"  \n\n\nAt this point, the cashier (let's call her Meg) informs me that if I keep this up, I would be asked to leave. At this point, Kate has a shit-eating grin on her face.  \n\n\nObviously, I decide it's not worth being kicked out of a place where I'm known by a first name basis... so I shut my mouth. I get my items, but in the meantime, I hear Kate talking to Meg. She's clearly talking loud enough so I can hear it from where I'm at.  \n\n\nKATE: \"What do you think about all this?\"  \nMEG: \\*incomprehensible from where I was\\*  \nKATE: \"That guy's such a fucking ASSHOLE.\"  \n\n\nShe brushes past me, with a smug look on her face, after she pays (there was one person in line between us, at this time).  \n\n\nI figure this is all over. Fine. Whatever.  \n\n\nBut then, as I'm paying, I hear something from the doorway, turning to see that Kate was standing in the open door, letting in all the cold air as she berated me:  \n\n\nKATE: \"You fucking asshole!\"  \nKATE: \"I bet you got a tiny dick!\"  \nKATE: \"You fucking dickless asshole!\"  \n\n\nEtc...  \n\n\nI pay for my 52 oz soda and start towards the door. I start to walk towards my car, when I have an idea:  \n\n\nI can either go around the passenger side of her car, or the driver's side. I decide... Driver's side.  \n\n\nME: \"Excuse me, I need to get to my car.\"  \nKATE: \"What?\"  \nME: \"I'm want to get to my car. And there's no other path to get there.\"  \nKATE: \"What's your problem, asshole?\"  \nME: \"Nothing, just that I have to talk to a stupid cunt.\"  \nKATE: \"Oh, yeah, I'm a  cunt. A great big cunt.\"  \nKATE: \"I have a great big vagina that just spills out of my pants  \n*(at this point, Kate is making hand gestures, showing how big her vagina is, and how it flows from her jeans)*  \nME: \"It shows. It REALLY does!\"  \n\n\nI continue to brush past her to get to my car and she leans into me, spilling my soda over both of us, leaving about only half of the soda in the cup, with a crack down one side. At this point, Kate is stunned. She has no words. I continue walking to my car when I hear the guttural yelp of someone desperately throwing something. When the smell of carmel, cream and gas station coffee hits me, I realize that the entire back of my coat is covered in her disgusting half-coffee.  \n\n\nI turn on my heel, half of a soda still in my hands. I consider myself an expert on aiming drinks, mainly due to the fact that I end up with a lot of half-finished drinks, which I tend to toss in an arc, as opposed to making a big puddle. So, I took aim and returned fire, covering the front of her shirt in even more soda than had been spilled before.  \n\n\nSoaking wet (and wanting to prove to her that I'm a better person than her) I threw my empty cup away, got in my car, and tried to leave. She was already on my bumper, fumbling with her phone, trying to record me. I yell for her to get out of my way, as I'm trying to leave. I rev my engine, which makes her back off a little, then use the gap to zip past her and around the other side of the pumps and out the exit of the gas station.  \n\n\nI later learned that she had called the cops on me. That the cops had watched video of the altercation, but nothing else. It's been a week and I have yet to hear from the cops (my plate would have DEFINITELY been on camera, assuming they hadn't moved them since I worked there.), and I was informed by Deb, the manager from before, that none of the cops were told my name. And when I relayed the full story, Deb was trying hard to hold back a laugh.  \n\n\nI later learned that I had distressed Meg with the confrontation in the store, as she wasn't sure how to handle the situation. She was alone at the store, at the time, and both of us (apparently) were regulars. It had apparently caused her to break down a bit, as I was informed that after the incident, Meg was in tears.  \n\n\nSo, I ask: Am I the Asshole?",

Since my kid was born 3 years and a few months ago I have felt nothing but dread every time my husband tries to make a move on me. I went 2 of those years without being diagnosed with PPD, making taking care of my child a nightmare, let alone the little time I had for myself well...also a nightmare. i started getting treatment after a huge meltdown in November 2016. This resulted in me being diagnosed bipolar 2 and most recently borderline personality disorder. \n\nI'm extremely difficult to deal with and I will be forever grateful to my husband for being there for me. However, back when we were dating there was a period when we were living in different countries and signs of an unhealthy relationship started showing. I tried to break it off because I didn't believe in LDR, he would say he couldn't live without me, so he would guilt me into staying with him. I'm talking 2011. Sorry, I digress, but I feel it's meaningful. (We got married in 2012 btw).\n\n\nBack to the present. We had my parents over for a few months (this is not uncommon where I'm from) and them helping with the kid (great since I'm not that motherly even though I love the kid) made me feel great and gave me an awesome excuse not to have sex with my husband (not to mention our baby still sleeps with us), but when they left he started expecting us to get intimate again. I don't want him anymore. I love him as the father of my kid but I just...it doesn't work. He's controlling, expects to control my bank account. If I have any friends he expects me to see them home so he can see them (even if he does disappear a couple of days a week for hours and I don't inquire). If I'm on my phone he expects me to tell him who I'm talking to. I recently removed his fingerprint from my phone and he got all suspicious.\n\n\nI feel awful. I'm not working at the moment so he has all this power over me, which he enjoys. I don't know what to do. AITA for wanting to file for divorce ASAP and taking my kid to another country? There are other causes for my wanting to divorce him I can't mention here, per subreddit rules. Real shitty ones.",

I made it very clear to him that if Ted wanted to stay, he would have to pay the Bond + rent upfront before he could stay for even 1 night to which he happily agreed to but said he'd pay on Friday.\n\nThe next morning (Tuesday), I woke up to see something strange, which was Ted's car in the driveway, and to my surprise, he had already crashed a night in the area which disappointed me because I thought he wouldn't do anything like that. When I woke Ted up, his voice was muddled and unintelligible, he wasn't able to give a proper reason as to why he stayed the night, only saying \"i won't do this again, and I will make sure I'll pay by Friday\". He then asks when I head out to university on Friday which I said 11AM, and he replied with \"That'll be easy, I'll come by before then and pay up\". \n\nCome Friday morning, Ted never showed up, so I tried contacting him a few times before leaving for university, he got back to me around 12PM saying \"I was packing my stuff, and on a phone call with a possible employer, sorry about that, you have my word that I'll come by tomorrow before 12PM.\" \nIt was already at this point I was doubting my decision to let him stay if he can't uphold his word, so I decided to give him one more chance to see if he changed.\n\nSaturday morning, he didn't show up again, no signs of contacting me via call or text and at this point I really felt like I can't let him stay if he doesn't hold his word to do something as simple as showing up in the morning and pay the Bond + rent. So I tried calling him once in the afternoon, no response, and around 10 times in the evening to get a text saying \"I am in another call, will call you back\" and so I waited. Till around 1:30AM I waited for his call back to see why he didn't show up, only to not get a phone call.\n\nSunday morning (today), Ted still hasn't shown up and I have tried ringing him a few times to get a text saying \"Can't speak right now, will call you back later\". It was at this point I decided to make the decision to reply with \"I'll make this easier for you, leave. This has been unacceptable and you know that\". The reason why it's unacceptable is because this isn't the only time he's done something like this, he's done it before when he stayed before (like 9 months ago). He told me on Monday that he was a changed man and out of the few interactions over the week, I could tell he hasn't at all. \n\nAll he needed to do was to show up and pay the bond + rent, or inform me that something was going on but he never said anything other than \"call you later\".\n\nAm I the Asshole for doing what I did?",

She often makes plans and then pretends as though there was no plans when she completely flakes, I never really get mad.\n\nWas going through bad withdrawls from an alcohol addiction, diffiult to sleep.

I tried to ask how its reasonable to break up with someone before even hearing why they didnt answer. I tried to say what If i was hit by a car I was going to wake up to those texts? and she just said thats ridiculous and laughed at me. I know its unlikely but you never know.\n\nMy best friend (or so I thought) always supported me by saying she was crazy and everyone hated her, then on a big night out I asked him to come back with me after and relax, was told he wasnt leaving till later. So i text and said when your on  way back come chill for a bit, no reply. I said if you go back to another one of my mates I can meet you guys there, these people that are supposed friends.\n\nNext day he tried to tell me how he and another guy went back to his and a few people went back with my EX. I asked who and he said he doesnt know. He then started telling me stories about the night and named people specifically who were at her house, him being one of them. About 7 people. I proceeded to say didnt you just tell me you didnt go there and didnt know who did, and then he changed the story and said he only went there for 10 minutes with the guy then left.

I said even if you were sparing my feelings, in reality you shouldve come back with me if you are telling the truth when you constantly say what a horrible person she is and what shes done to me.

She said the cat is now 7 and would need blood work to get spayed as well??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe kinda got into it for a while.

It's been rocky for me, because my parents kicked me out after I'd turned 18 and finished high school-- to explain more in detail, I'd originally been planning on joining the military immediately after HS and had been recruited and training for nearly a year for boot, but things fell through once it was realized that I have serious issues with depression, ADHD, &amp; PTSD (these things can disqualify you from being able to serve). A few weeks after I graduated HS, things began to explode at my home. I was equal parts frustrated with myself for not having any idea what to do now/how to get my life on track, while also juggling what I now knew for a fact to be mental disorders, and also being upset with the psychologically&amp;physically abusive treatment my parents forced on me and my siblings. So I got literally kicked to the curb.\n\nA friend's parents took me in and got me started heading in the right direction. I applied to stuff, got accepted, and thanks to the FASFA my parents had filled out at a high school thing earlier in the year, I was able to afford to go through loans, scholarships, and jobs. My parents have re-done the FASFA for me yearly, but other than that we are not on speaking terms and they give me no financial support, period. I'm homeless outside of the school year and generally spend time with my long-time partner's family in summer/on holidays, helping to pay bills.\n\nMy parents ain't great. I have PTSD thanks to them, and my depression has been exacerbated, if not directly caused by their actions towards me and my siblings when I was young. It's also all but confirmed I have DID because of the long-term abuse too. But recently, my parents have began to make attempts to reach out to me, inquiring about my graduation so that they can come and telling me how upset all my siblings are that they haven't seen me in almost four years.\n\nI think they want to reconnect with me. But, I hate them since they abused me so badly for 18 years and fucked me up on such an unfixable level. I'm going to have to live with my issues for **the rest of my life** and I resent them for that. But we're related even if I wish we weren't and I'd be a lying if I said that people can't change. I don't know if I could ever forgive&amp;forget, but I don't know if it'd even be fair to deny them the opportunity to come to my college graduation, especially since I *couldn't* have done it without the FASFA loans I took out. \n\nWith all this said, I kinda want to give them a hard no and ban them from attending my graduation, even despite their requests.

I had told her I want to move in with a friend because I think not living together would help our relationship more and give me the space I need. She started crying and screaming about how I was â€œso ungratefulâ€? and â€œnot ready for the real world.â€? \n\nIâ€™d had enough and that point and told her I wanted out because she has no idea how to treat anyone with any sort of respect, let alone her own daughter.

It is an interactive game where you spon a roulette to win 'money' to win money to build items to complete a village before you can move on to a next one.

I was amused but perturbed the first time, really annoyed the second but I'm pissed off now because I just logged on and for the day she has attacked me over 20 times.

There is a reason I broke up with her â€“ because I realised I was with her out of â€œhabitâ€? instead of love, that she was a little too into the money I was making as a lawyer, and I simply did not want to be in a relationship with her anymore. A baby doesnâ€™t change that.  \n\nI tell her I am not moving out there.

It means I get extra/too-much heat and A/C at times. \n\nThe situation:\n\nMy dad walked in a few days ago and told me that I should cover one of my vents, because I had the window open for an hour to air out my room (nasty smell, probably from a shower and humidity) and he thought I was doing it because I was hot. I explicitly told him no, I won't do that. It's a bad idea (even if you don't include the fire risk) to cover it with cardboard, because it causes a reverse flow and damages the system in the long run by forcing it to work harder, and it would still result in the same amount of heat being redirected to one vent (best case scenario two-three of other rooms, but not with the way our house is laid out). I've called numerous AC/Heater repairmen, and asked them about this, because I wanted to do it way back. Almost every single one of them told me it was a bad idea. That, added with the bonus of me looking it up myself, dissuaded me from that idea. \n\nI came home the other day, and saw that, in fact, my dad had ignored my wishes, which was normal at this point in time, and did it anyway. I do live with him, and I am aware that he owns the house. That being said, I would assume that any rational human being would want to avoid being roasted alive by their own A/C system, so I took it down and reverted to my previous solution: just wearing more or less clothes based on how hot/cold I am when I go to sleep. Walking around in shorts and a T-shirt isn't bad at all, either. \n\nHe walked in today and exploded at me, for defying his authority and taking down a piece of cardboard held up by masking tape. I told him I slept in that room and I should have some opinion, but he said it was his house. I told him I would just sleep on the couch and he told me I could sleep on the street for all he cares. He then went and got a ladder and put it back up, telling me that I would see what would happen if I took it down again.\n\nEveryone on his side of the family (grandparents) agree with him, think that I shouldn't \"defy my father\" and call me a problem child for even arguing with him at all. They basically told me that if I didn't like what my dad was doing, I could move out with no support from anyone. My sisters think the man is crazy.

I just want to know if I did the right thing. Here's the back story: \n\n\n\nSome months before I got pregnant I got a call from the hospital after a routine PAP smear test. They found cancer cells and I was to visit them ASAP. This is all after a year of remission from my breast cancer. They told me I had to quit the birth control pill because the hormones could be influencing my cervix. I quit that day and had planned to get a coil in after my second period. \n\n\nA week later I got my first period. But the second period never came. I went to my GP and said \"doctor, I'm now 1 month over time for my period and I'm worried\". He said \"don't worry, it can take up to 6 months for your period to regulate again\". So I had no worries. He didn't recommend a pregnancy test. \n\n\nTwo months after this my SO tells me I'm getting fat and to get a test. Test comes back positive. I immediately call my GP. He tells me to come in for an ultrasound. He puts the apparatus on my belly and starts laughing, like full on laugh. He turns the screen my way and there on the screen I see my daughter for the first time. Her head, back, rib cage, legs, all are formed. This is no just conceived embryo. He tells me I'm at least 3 to 4 months in. So abortion is still possible but I must make the decision very quickly. I decide to keep it after discussing with SO.\n\n\nI'm very pro-choice, and if I was maybe 1 month a long instead of 3 the possibility of me aborting it would be 90%. But it was a person in my mind. \n\n\nOur situation is also not great for raising a child. Here's a list: \n\n\n- My SO is 21 years old (20 when I got pregnant), and still in college. He won't be done with school for another 4 years. \n\n- My SO is in huge debt because of parking/insurance tickets and all his finances go towards that (which is good, I want him to be debt free, but it needs to be considered).\n\n- We do not own a house or rent a place, we live with my father (who now also has to deal with this new born, he's 65 and recently retired). My father agreed to give us the upper floor of the house (3 large bed rooms) to create a nursery, a bedroom and a study room. \n\n- My income solely goes towards renovation of these rooms, the baby things we need and whatever is left is for our food and other expenses. I also save 10% and another 5% for little one when she's 18. My net income a month is between â‚¬2200 and â‚¬3000. \n\n- I'm currently on maternity leave but before this I was working as a consultant. I lost the project I was on because of maternity leave. My boss is looking for a new project for me to start after maternity leave. But it could mean we have to live on 70% of my income if he can't find anything in time. \n\n\n\n\nSo with all these points in mind am I the asshole for keeping her and wanting to raise her?",

I know I shouldn't have just left, but I just felt really frustrated.\n\nI just want to know if I'm the asshole. Should I have just listened to my mother and dealt with it for another year? Or were my actions reasonable?",

            "input": "So I just discovered this subreddit and thought I would ask this question because its one that I have been wondering about and my family isn't really objective because they will simply take my side. I had this friend in high school that I would constantly go to parties with and play video games with and we had a similar sense of humour but I really didn't like him for a number of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would always need money. He would want me to buy him food, he would need me to buy him cigarettes (I hate smoking so this really pissed me off) and he would also want me to give him money so he could buy weed. It got to the point where he owed me at least 200 dollars. Remember, this is high school, money is scarce and every amount of it I had, my parents are asking what I did with it. It pissed me off that I would be decent enough to give him some of the money my parents would allow me to have to spend on things I wanted and he would never pay me back and joke about how he never would like it wasn't a serious issue for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would take advantages of privileges my parents would afford me and ruin them. An example is that my dad would let me use his car every so often but it cam under the condition that I treat the car with respect and this friend would constantly insist on smoking cigarettes in the car and would light up without asking first. I got in trouble multiple times because of this and had car privileges revoked. He would also say we should just smoke weed in the car and then drive back to one of our places like driving under the influence wasn't a big deal. What if a bunch of intoxicated 16-17 year olds get pulled over by the police while high out of our minds. My license would get taken away and he didn't seem to care. Just do it! Whats the big deal??? And he would act like I was being a bitch about these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He wanted to smoke weed every day. I am someone who has a bit of an addiction problem with weed. If I smoke it every day, my grades tank, I start putting on serious amounts of fat, and generally become a less functioning person but he insists on smoking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically what I did was continue the friendship until graduation and then when I didn't need to see him again, I cut all contact and never spoke to him again. He would continue texting me for a few weeks after that wondering what was going on but I didn't respond. I just ghosted him hard and I feel bad about it sometimes. But I've barely smoked week since and lost 40 pounds and put on a bit of muscle. My grades in University were actually similar to those in high school which is unheard of. I'm just a better person and many of the goals in my life couldn't be achieved while catering to the type of lifestyle he insisted on if we were to continue hanging out. I don't really have any friends from high school though because they decided to stick with him rather than me. My relationships with my parents has improved drastically though and I've made better friends since. Maybe I should have handled breaking off the friendship differently. I don't know. I do know that he was not good for me. Am I the ass hole?",

            "input": "TLDR at bottom. I used to work at both Pizza Hut and Papa John's and can barely stomach their food anymore, so whenever I get pizza delivery it's Domino's 99% of the time. When I order, I always order several of the extra cups or sauce. I don't expect it for free, I'll gladly pay for it if I can get the dinner i want. I use a lot of sauce on my food and also keep extras in the cabinet for home cooking and when they forget my sauce. I'm not gonna be an asshole and make them drive back to the store and back to me all for 1 garlic sauce for no extra tip, but after a while I get tired or having my order wrong.\n\nThe problem is, over 50% of the time they miss one or more of the extra sauces I paid for. Even after I ask the delivery person if they got all the sauces, they will still be missing or wrong. It got the point to where I've called the store and talked to the manager, he assures me it won't happen again and it does. So I started telling the drivers the next time they forget my sauce they won't be getting a tip. Now I used to be a driver too, so I know sometimes you forget things or the person on cut table didn't put the sauce in the box like they said they did. So I started putting in the driver instructions that I won't tip them if they forget my sauce. Nothing else I say or do seems to help. So last night, it happened. I ordered 11 extra sauces. I ask the driver when he gets there if he got all my sauce, he hands me a bag. Normally that's where I tip them but after getting it wrong so many times, I have to check. So I open it and check them, not only is the total count short by 2, missing 1 of the marinara cups and the only cup of icing for the dessert, all 4 cups that were supposed to be mango habanero were instead ranch that I ordered zero of. So out of 11 sauces I ordered and paid for, I only got 5 of them correct. \n\nBeing an ex driver myself, I didn't want it to come to this. But it had gone too far. I handed him back the ranch that I didn't order and told him I won't be tipping because the sauces were wrong yet again and that next time if they wanted a tip, my order should be correct.\n\nTLDR. I always order and pay for extra sauce with pizza, they have gotten my order wrong so many times I won't tip anymore if even 1 item is wrong or missing. Am I The Asshole?\n",

Iâ€™ve always been a little closer with my mom. I could at least confide in her some and and we spent some time together doing things here and there. But we never could talk about anything too deep.

Then, out of the blue, she sent me screenshots of tickets out to my city! \nTurns out, she was planning on staying for a whole entire week. However, she didnâ€™t consult me on this at all and already told her parents that sheâ€™d be staying with me (I live with my big family, itâ€™s really difficult to accommodate somebody since thereâ€™s already so many of us). So here I am, already trying to plan an out of state move, and now I have to entertain her. She insists on certain experiences that I just CANâ€™T afford right now (and I told her that). On top of that, after going out and spending money on one of those said experiences (in which my new meds fucked me up and I felt sick but she wanted to keep adventuring), I was absolutely exhausted and wanted nothing more that to relax in my own bed and play my own games. But when I said this, she flat out told me that I COULDNâ€™T play because she was going to play instead. Also, I went out for a bit to gather some stuff from storage and she went through all the stuff in my room and decided what of my stuff to keep and what to toss/give away (I did not ask her to do this). She even tossed some of my tax documents. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m happy I got to meet her and we did have fun times, but this is also seriously stressing me out because I really wanted to spend this time organizing, packing, and spending time with my family. I had no idea sheâ€™d be coming until it was too late. So here I am, trying to decompress so I can talk to her about it. But AITA for being a bit frustrated about all this? \nTLDR; an internet friend came to visit without consulting me but Iâ€™m short on money and in the middle of trying to move.

She told me everything last minute. \nShe hasnâ€™t exactly been there for me growing up either. When I turned 18, she told me to live on my own and she will find a place for just her and my brother. Growing up since then, Iâ€™ve been on my own financially. Sheâ€™s barely helped me grow up into the person I am, asked me for money all the time and sheâ€™s never helped me get my license. I used to ask her to help me practice to get my license and sheâ€™d say no. I also asked for help financially on driving classes but she refused to help.

This is just one issue in a very hard year, as there is much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo start off I guess, my son is dead. My little boy was 13 months old. A pillar of health. We cherished and looked after that boy with all we had. His perfect on Tuesday and Dying on Wednesday, and passed 7 days later. This is a whole other story unto itself.  I got along well enough with my in-laws. my mother-in-law acts very immature and erratic. My wife told her mom used to an alcoholic. As I got more confident in my relationship with my wife I told her \"I think your mom might have alcoholic brain damage\"\n\nWhere I need help is this...\n\nMy son needed emergency surgery as his brain, for unexplained reasons, was swelling. They had to remove part of his skull to allow for the expansion. My parents arrived within an hour of my call. My in-laws (whom this post is about) arrived much later even though they live 30 mins closer.\n\nMy in-laws left as quickly as they arrived. My parents however stayed.  They slept on waiting room coffee tables waiting to hear if our little boy would live. He made it through that first surgery, only to pass away the day after mother's day.\n\nMy parents never left our side. Even though they had brought no clothes or supplies. My in laws on the other hand did not reappear until it was time to say goodbye. My mother-in-law arrived in Pajama shorts and a t shirt that was too small to hid her girth. She began to ask the nurse if they ever treated any murders.\n\nAs we took our time saying our goodbyes, she noisily played games on her iPad.\n\nThe nurses arranged it so we could take him outside one last time even though he was on life support. You see our son rarely cried but whenever he did we simply took him outside. It cheered him up instantly. Being outdoors was his favorite place in the world.\n\nMy wife went first, and held him one last time beneath the stars to say goodbye before I even had my turn my mother in law asked us to hurry up. I was furious. I told her in he calmest voice I could muster \"leave\". I meant for her to go home. She took it as permission to go inside. She stopped to clarify and I just said \"Go!\"\n\nWe brought my son back inside and they disconnected him from the machines that kept him alive. It was the hardest thing ever. (I have been diagnosed with depression, severe anxiety and PTSD and I am on anti-depressants as a result.)\n\nWhile we were waiting for him to pass on he slowly was turning grey my mother in law decided to clean up his hospital room. Problem with that is as you know she wasn't there, so the stuff she was throwing out was our paperwork from the social worker for grief support etc.  My mom stopped her from throwing it out. While I yelled at her to stop. All the while my father-in-law and sister-in-law sat there doing nothing with annoyed looks.\n\nWhen he was finally gone, my wife had to wait for the nurses to remove him from her arms, which is quite difficult as he was limp. My mother-in-law left immediately. When my wife got up she asked crying \"where is my mom? I need a hug\".\n\nWe did not see or speak to my in laws for 2 days. We couldn't bear the hurt on top of the grief. I decided to clear the air and invited just my father-in law for lunch. He arrived and made idle chit chat and then got up to leave. I said what about lunch? He said he needed to get home. We told him to wait; we needed to discussed somethings.\n\nWe described how hurt we were by my mother in laws behavior and he said she just didn't cope well. We said we would do our best to understand, but while we are sorting out our feelings please ask her not to disturb us, and also if she is struggling that she has the option not to come to our son's visitation, we would understand. His response was \"well I guess I'll go home and kill myself\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no clue what he said to my mother-in-law. Next thing we know she phones and says \"I hear you are upset with me. TOO. FUCKING.BAD. I won't be at the visitation.\" 'Click'\n\nI was furious. I feel like I had just failed as a father, I was not going to fail as a husband. I immediately called her back and tore her a new one. Her response was \"I am not going to talk to you if you are going to use that language\".\n\nI said \"Fuck you! you don't get to swear at my grieving wife and then claim some kind of moral high ground!\" She hung up on me. She immediately phone my wife who has said and done nothing at this point. She calls my wife a fucking bitch and hangs up. She begins to phone us every 2 seconds. The she starts sending threatening texts that she will harm us.\n\nI call my father-in-law and told him to get things under control or I am calling the police. He begged me not to call the cops and took away her phone.\n\nThe calls stopped.\n\nWe did not receive any support from my wife's family. They did not attend any events prior to his Visitation. My father in-law showed up late to my sons visitation in cargo shirt and an old golf shirt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days pass. I call my wife's aunt who I have gotten to know a little as they are not a close family.\n\nI asked her for some perspective on the my mother-in law. She said they had a falling out over 20 years ago. The aunt had apparently cancelled a sleep over between my wife and her cousin. The cousin didn't want to go anymore.\n\nMy mother-in-law told the aunt \"I hope you die\". She then drove over to their home knocked on the aunt's door and told her again face to face \"I hope you die\". Apparently My wife's family disappeared for 3 years. the extended family had no idea where they were.\n\nThen we spoke to my Wife's grandmother. She told us that my mother in law was diagnosed as bi-polar years ago and has a history of violent behavior, including smashing the grandmother in a car door, repeatedly.\n\nThe grandmother says re-iterates that they lost track of my wife and in-laws whereabouts for 3 years. She feared that she would be violent towards my wife. My wife broke into tears saying that her mother had beaten her repeatedly in her drunken stupors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we have a clearer picture. my Mother in-law is mentally ill.\n\nMy father-in-law knew this and hid it from his children. He knew how unstable his wife was and still brought her to the hospital. He completely mismanaged the situation by keeping everyone in the dark. My wife asked him very respectfully for a break in communication(advice from her therapist) as she needed to heal and her family was hurting more than helping.\n\nIts been a few months and we finally heard from him again. I have copy and pasted his email below\n\n \"I hope you are doing well, you are always in my thoughts. I'm   \nwriting this email because we really need your help with mom.  \nShe has been in the psych. ward in the Brantford hospitable twice, once   \nfor 6 days and then for over 2 weeks.  \nThe root of this problem was her reaction to Luca's passing and how her   \nreaction to this was treated. As her therapist says, everybody reacts to   \ndeath differently and no two people grieve the same. I think it would be   \nhealthier if you two couldÂ  get past this and start a healing process.  \nAt the present your mother is sliding back into her very depressed   \nstate, brought on by two things: the absence of Lucas and the absence of   \nher eldest daughter. She said this to her therapist at her latest session.  \nI'm sure mum miss's you and thinks of you often but is nervous to reach   \nout to you as you may not be ready for this.  \nMoms therapist is very concerned with your moms mental state so........I   \nthink a phone call or set up a visit ( just you ) to see if you two can   \nreconnect at some level, even if it's meeting at a coffee shop or at   \nmom's therapist's office. Whatever you are both comfortable with.  \nIt may or may not work but I see this as a good viable option to whats   \ngoing on now.  \nSo, mull this over and please let me know if us getting together is a   \npossibility. We would really like it to be.  \nLove Dad. \"\n\nIn her response my wife told him everything we had learned and pointed out how he had failed as a father, including this email which was void of fatherly concern for her well being. She did offer to meet with mother in laws therapist, if it would help.\n\nHis response was \"Sorry to have disappointed you. Have a nice life!\"\n\nI was furious with this email. Not only did he not care about my wife's mental state, he did not try to reestablish communications first before making an ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has made the decision she is done with her parents. I have supported her decision as they have been toxic to both our recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It was pretty obvious this guy was very drunk. He became annoying very quickly as he started ranting about nonsense to his friend. Although he hasn't harassing anyone he was just generally being rude and annoying and combined with all the other shit that had gone down that day, I was pissed off. I took my phone out and I wrote a message in one of my discord groups complaining about my situation. \n\nI then somewhat jokingly wrote in reference to the drunk guy \"what a degenerate\". Now I know that the word degenerate can have some rough connotations, so I just wanted to clarify that I didn't mean it in the way a nazi would use it, more of like the live in your mom's basement, NEET, piss in jars, sort of degeneracy. Anyways my friend in the discord chat basically called me out and said I was being unnecessarily cruel and an asshole. I was more surprised than anything because this is a guy is someone who usually doesn't care about what you say; you could spout every racial slur and swear word in the book and he wouldn't care. I pointed this out and said he was being hypocritical, because he had made fun of me for getting offended by language in the past. He argued that this was different because I was specifically targeting an individual. \n\nIn the end I apologized and he expressed sympathy as well. The drunk guy got off the train a few stops later, and everything was put behind us.

I did this to help him out, especially because I didn't think he would be able to find anyone to help him out that early in the morning.

Once he even asked if we could both leave class early to get food, which I declined.\n\nHe doesn't have a job due to his anxiety, so he can't buy his own lunch and often asks me to take him to get food and then to pay for him. He also can't offer to contribute to gas for this reason. \n\nTLDR Anxious friend who lives in opposite direction of school from me asks me for rides and food but can never pay me back. \n\nI'm trying to be understanding, but I'm losing patience with him.

The iPad has been shipped and I should he getting it tomorrow\n\nBut the thing is when I got home for school they told me they used the money for insurance and they would put the money in my account next month.

            "input": " \n\nTL;DR at bottom.\n\nProbably one of many similar posts - I know it's never possible to give full details, but I'll try. My family suffers from a range of mental challenges/conditions/illnesses: ADHD, Aspergers, depression, substance abuse, gender identity, anxiety. Although miraculously none of the uglier symptoms present themselves around friends or guests, they all come out in the wash during family holidays. This year, the parents rented a cottage in the middle of nowhere, so we will all be stuck together with no place to go.\n\nThis Thanksgiving has been a foretaste of what I fear will happen come Christmas. In just the last two days, I've been through enough mental illness crap to make me not want to come for Christmas. One sister had a two-hour violent meltdown over playing MineCraft (she's 11) that resulted in my father having to restrain her about six times. The other has ignored the houseguest from Japan she brought home from college (who, unfortunately, has had to witness all this going on), and freaked out during a board game: there was some confusion over a move that did not involve her: my family tends to get loud and talk over each other and that triggered her anxiety which resulted in her throwing a fit and her game pieces and storming out of the house. Just today I was yelled at for 'always looking for an argument': my mother announced her intention to shut off the internet for several hours to install a new router and I observed that I (and the Japanese exchange student) were working on online classwork. I'm typing this expecting the internet to shut off at any moment - I retreated to a closed room to avoid further conflict over the issue.\n\nI have tried to adopt the perspective that my role is to be a peacemaker as much as possible (e.g, acquiescing to simple demands, being a kind host to this poor Japanese girl and just talking to her). However, this Thanksgiving has made me feel that I am horrible in that role. I will admit that their behavior does not always bring out the best in me - I do not take well to my sister hitting and kicking my parents or the dog, for example. I am fully aware that some of this behavior is beyond my family's control; however, it is frustrating to see it under control around friends/guests, but receive the full brunt of it over political discussions, or even stupid things like games. Part of the reason I'm considering cancelling my Christmas ticket is so I won't end up becoming one of several assholes over Christmas.\n\nI fully anticipate that between the various diagnoses and differences on politics and religion that there will be several shitshows come Christmas. However, this holiday is the one time of year my entire family gets together. We will also have a bit of extended family joining us, too. If I don't show, it will be noticed and talked about, and break my parents' and grandparents' hearts. I've also had to pay nearly $1000 for Christmas travel, which I will only get about $600 back in the form of travel vouchers if I cancel. I have no idea what the alternative would be, as I don't have another family to 'adopt' me for the holidays (e.g., SO).\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for skipping family Christmas to avoid conflict aggravated by mental illness, knowing that it will hurt my family deeply if I don't come?",

That's why the following situation kind of surprised me. Using a throwaway account because I'm not super proud of myself.\n\nSo before I continue, I need to tell you that I've always felt insecure about my looks, and my average height and average build - or even below average growing up. I've always had interest in sports and all things considered \"masculine\" but I've often been left out of matches, sporting events, bachelor parties etc because I've always tried fitting in with the more masculine tough guys, and although they've always been formally nice to me, I don't think anyone has ever seen me as their peer. I've learnt to accept it, but it's always been a mild frustration for me.\n\nSo about two and a half months ago I joined a new firm, and everyone has been pretty welcoming, inviting me over for a drink after work etc, but I've started noticing the same pattern. Guys playing sports over the weekend don't invite me, or don't take my comments about sports, or relationships etc seriously... Again the big guys have their own circle where I don't feel like I fit in. But there is this one guy who's been very friendly, helpful and overall did everything he could to help me adjust to the new environment. Now, this guy is about my age, maybe a few years older, everyone at the office likes him, he's a great worker, and physically he's very imposing, tall, good looking, well built... everything I've always wanted to be, and more than anyone I've known he's shown interest in my opinions about sports, politics, relationships etc, and he's invited me to matches, sporting events and such. I know it's childish, but this really made me feel like I was finally accepted into the \"boys club\" after feeling left out for most of my life, because I didn't look right, or wasn't tall enough, confident enough, or whatever it is that someone did or did not see in me.\n\nSo a few days ago we went for a beer after work, a couple of us colleagues, and after everyone else went home, my new friend and I talked about women and relationships for a while, and it turns out he's gay. I've never had a close gay friend, only a few good acquaintances I share with my girlfriend, and like I said earlier, I've always supported and respected the LGBT community. But I have to admit that I was kind of disappointed that this guy is gay, because I've always wanted to have at least one friend like him, who would share my interests and who would accept me as I am, but I always assumed it would be a str8 guy. Am I the asshole for being disappointed here, or am I just overthinking this?",

Overall he's a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it's funny but sometimes she really doesn't want it and he won't stop even if she yells at him.

I said if someone hurts her and won't stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it's absolutely fine to push him away. \n\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\n\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I'd be wrong here. That it's always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn't tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her.

The stop to exit is at the bottom of a big hill coming around a blind corner and there is at least one rear end accident a month because people go too fast down hill and can't see that there's a car stopped there. \nThis is exactly what happened to me yesterday. I was waiting to exit onto the road and was absolutely slammed into which pretty much totaled my car. Thank god there's no injuries, I got very very lucky. \n\nSo here's where it gets weird and where I may very much be an asshole. When I got out there was this absolutely stunningly gorgeous girl looking over the damage and crying her eyes out and saying how incredibly sorry she was. I THOUGHT she was saying that she was distracted and had made a huge mistake and therefore assumed she was the driver. I told her that it was ok and that we'd let insurance cover it and maybe it wasn't that bad and that she really had nothing to be sorry for since accidents happen to all of us. We talked for maybe 2 minutes and I was in such shock that I had no idea what I said, she is now claiming that I said that I wouldn't call the police or even turn it into my insurance. I MAY have said that, but I don't think that I did...but honestly I was shaking so bad that I don't know what exactly I said. \n\nAfter I got done chatting with her another girl started to get out of the drivers seat. I was completely confused because like I said I assumed the girl I'd been talking to had been the driver but it turns out I was wrong. To put it mildly, the actual driver was not nearly as \"cute\" as the other driver was the first thing that I noticed. She was so obese that she was essentially stuck in the car and her friend went around to help her. And instead of crying or being sorry like the girl I thought was driving had been, the actual driver got out of the car and started screaming bloody murder at me about what an asshole I was to have been stopped there, how it was totally my fault, etc. I was so pissed I instantly called the campus police to have them come do a police report. \nBut because I had allegedly \"forgiven\" the girl I thought was driving, both of them started calling me everything from asshole to nice guy because they assumed I was willing to let the \"pretty\" girl slide on the accident. I honestly don't think I ever said that but I do admit I was much nicer to her which was partly based on her looks in total honesty, but so much more based on her attitude and not blaming me. the police found the driver at fault but even the officer gave me a dirty look when she found out what I allegedly said to the \"pretty\" girl.\n\nAm I the asshole for treating these girls differently and being much more congenial to the pretty girl than the way I'm going after the girl who actually caused the accident?",

After that, she gave my number to him and he started trolling my social media and insulting me, my family, and my friends while alluding that my ex told him a bunch of secrets I told her when we were together, and started rattling off on some sensitive things.\n\nThis pissed me off, and in retaliation I told him he should stop wasting his time talking to me and go fuck my ex, because she's \"easy\" and immediately sent him a bunch of explicit images of her she had sent me. They weren't nudes, as she was fully clothed, but they were provocative pictures of her in her underwear and making semi-sexual poses. This is something I know would immensely embarrass her and they both blocked me after that.\n\nMonths later, I have a new SO and my ex tries to get in touch with her. She says that she's been going to therapy and her therapist supposedly told her to get in touch with me or someone close to me in order to get closure, but she then does this by bad-mouthing me.

So, I made a lot of excuses for him.\n\nAbout 6 months ago he got fired and went into a deep depression. I have been drowning financially but supported him and he was unemployed the entire 6 months. I asked him to get help and he refused. It got to the point where I would be homeless if I didn't kick him out and start over in a new, smaller/cheaper place. \n\nSo I did. But we continued to see each other. He's been resentful and emotionally abusive on and off.

My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and her boyfriend of about 6 years. Him and I used to be pretty close until he started becoming really manipulative towards my mom, then towards my sister and I. Letâ€™s just say my sister and I arenâ€™t drinking his shitty grape flavored bootleg kool-aid. That causes quite a bit of friction between us all. For example, this weekend I was at my dads house (only me, my sister (f19) is still out of town), which is usually a hard time for my mom and her boyfriend because they are not on good terms with my father, so generally when I get home from my fathers house my moms boyfriend is pretty irritable at times, other times heâ€™s pretty cool. Today I came home and I was wearing a cropped shirt (which I am not allowed to wear, but my mom will allow it if I am wearing pants that are high waisted or a shirt under - basically if my stomach isnâ€™t showing). I had just gotten out of the car and my stomach was showing a little bit because my pants had fallen down a little; before I could pull my pants back up or even say hi to him the first thing he says to me is him getting on to me about my shirt, and I mean heâ€™s pretty aggravated about my shirt. I might be a brat for this but it upset me a little, so I said â€œwell itâ€™s nice to see you too.â€? with a bit of an attitude. He got pretty mad. He proceeded to tell me how I donâ€™t respect myself because I dress like a whore and that he didnâ€™t care if everyone else in the world does it, I canâ€™t. I get where heâ€™s coming from and all, but he couldnâ€™t have said hi to me first or at least approached it better? Heâ€™s never been a father before he met my mom and doesnâ€™t really understand how fragile a teen girls self confidence is, my mom said something to him about it, but then he told her that sheâ€™s making him out to be the bad guy because she doesnâ€™t want to parent me. This happens quite often, but only when he is feeling stressed/insecure, which he just got bad news on Friday at a doctors appointment (he has type two diabetes and is in denial about it). I know heâ€™s just trying deflect some embarrassment onto me, but Im getting pretty tired of it and beg my mom to leave him all the time. She says that he is her soulmate and that she would be miserable without him, but by staying with him sheâ€™s slowly losing her daughters. I persistently tell her that but it just angers her even more, ever since sheâ€™s met him sheâ€™s completely changed as a person. Sheâ€™s I love with him and I know that she hasnâ€™t had that in a very long time, so I feel like a bad person for resenting someone she views so highly. Im probably just going to move out after my senior year and only visit them once a year or so. I feel happier when Iâ€™m not around them and I think theyâ€™re happier without me. Am I in the wrong for resenting my mother and her boyfriend so much or do I actually have a good point?",

Despite this I have tried for years to make a relationship work between us to no avail. About 3 years ago it was feeling incredibly one sided so I just stopped contacting him to see if he actually had any interest in speaking with me of his own volition and in maintaining the relationship. Communication dried up for those years.\n\nMy sister doesn't know about the sexual abuse and as her older brother I took the physical abuse for her because I saw it as my duty to protect her, but she lived through the mental abuse maybe even worse than I had it. For a while this rightfully (in my mind) turned her against him. But then her husband threw her out in the streets on another continent and my father was the one she called and the one who came and got her through it. Good on him doing the right thing.\n\nWhere this gets more complicated is now in her eyes my dad can do no wrong. I was having a conversation with her about how much I wished I could have a normal relationship with him and her new view of him on the pedestal colored her words highly, but I didn't realize that at the time. After a long conversation between us I had the ridiculous idea that maybe it was all a misunderstanding and we just needed to communicate through it. That did not go well as I'm sure you can imagine.\n\n2 years ago I broke no contact with him and sent him a text. He is a multimillionaire and I live in poverty and have no insurance. I got test results that pointed to a high likelihood of cancer. I had no way to pay for any treatments I might have needed, was scared, and needed a father. I asked if he could loan me some money to help pay medical bills. He refused to help me at all if I did not move back into his house with him and claimed I was entitled for rejecting his \"help\" and asking for a loan, in many colorful words.\n\n(With no money to pursue further treatment or testing I still have no idea if I have cancer so maybe I'm dying? I don't even know. I've lost over 100 lbs in that time, albeit coming from obesity, but still it doesn't exactly seem like a good sign that I'm now underweight without trying to be.)\n\nWhen I spoke to him again after talking with my sister, I tried to explain how that previous conversation impacted me and that I wanted to find some common ground and try to move past this. At this point he throws my mental illness in my face and says I am not capable of knowing what I need and he knows better than me (despite knowing absolutely nothing about my life). This is where I snapped.\n\nMy entire life he promised to pay for my college education and he didn't even though he could have easily. No big deal under normal circumstance, whatever, it's his money. But I was pissed. I threw it in his face, hard. I chewed him out for every major and minor slight I could think of. I said I wish I didn't love him. I told him he was an awful parent and maybe if he had been successful in his suicide attempt when I was 4 I wouldn't be so fucked up with all the mental problems I have from his abuse.\n\nMy sister won't speak to me and I can't really blame her. She definitely sees me as the asshole. And even if she wasn't wrapped around my dad's finger, after saying something like that to him I don't know that there is ever a scenario where she wouldn't. But I'm sitting here thinking if she really knew the extent of the sexual abuse I suffered (or maybe even just knew it had happened at all) she might understand why I snapped and why the thought of just being around him gives me nightmares. But I want her to get a chance to have the kind of relationship I know I will never have with him and I don't want to ruin that chance for her by telling her.\n\nI know I shouldn't have said what I said. That's not even in question. It was a horrible thing to tell anyone. But given the context of our relationship and everything he has done to me I don't know if it makes me an asshole or just a guy pushed one step too far.",

I do find it unfortunate that, in that post, the fiancÃ© only mentioned this after the pregnancy. Regardless, a couple of years ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine told me she was pregnant (two days after our breakup, ostensibly by me). I told her that whether to keep the child was her choice, but that if she wanted me to support this child and/or any of the medical costs of the pregnancy that there would have to be a paternity test, and that if she wanted to do it after birth I would pay her back half the medical costs then. She got furious at this, and it turned out later that the whole thing was a fabricated attempt (literally using a pregnant friend's urine) to manipulate me into getting back together. (She had BPD, long and fairly hellish story there, hence breaking up with her to begin with, though I hope she's doing better now.)\n\nSince then, though, I've been pretty conscientious about being up front about this. Any time things have gotten serious with a girl, when we have that conversation about wanting kids or not (I very much want kids), I make sure to mention that I would never, regardless of any amount of \"trust,\" put my name on a birth certificate without knowing for a fact the kid is mine. Even for a second, third, etc. kid with the same partner. Pretty much no ladies have had a problem with this.\n\nThe responses to that post, however, seem to be full of people asserting that the fiancÃ© should just trust her and not take into account the massive financial, legal and time sink that can go into raising a child that isn't yours. People said he acted out of, for instance \"irrational fear.\" Given the average $233k cost (not including time and energy) to raise a child, and the $500 (max) cost of a paternity test, simple math tells us that if there's a 0.2% (500/233,000) chance of infidelity, it makes sense to get a test. And I mean, while everyone should trust their partner... why would you not make such a *tiny* investment to be safe?",

He moved in a few weeks after I did, last June. We started out okay; we'd go out for drinks or game together or just talk and it was fine. \n\nNot long after he moved in, he started drinking my alcohol without asking. The first few times, I told him I didn't appreciate him drinking my stuff without asking and to knock it off, and mentioned money. After that, I told him to knock it off and that I wanted him to pay me back for taking my stuff. He said he was an alcoholic, I apologized and said I didn't know and said I'd keep my stuff in my room, only to catch him sneaking into my room to take my stuff. I don't drink anymore because of new meds, but he's never paid me back for any of this.\n\nHe also has an issue of not being able to aim when he pees. I've tried to bring it up in a polite way, but nearly every night half the bathroom is covered in piss and it's really gross. I get that he's an alcoholic, but that doesn't make his pee everywhere any less gross. \n\nOn top of that, he blasts his TV every day. I figured asking him to use headphones at night would be a good compromise, so I asked him to be quiet after 11 PM. It's too loud for me to knock and ask him to turn it down so I try and text and ask him to turn it down, and if he doesn't I assume he's passed out and unplug the router in my room until it stops.

I had a migraine all day, so at 9 I texted him and asked him to turn his TV down since I had a migraine and he said ok.

He didn't, so I unplugged the router until he started screaming and then went out for a smoke. I texted him again to keep it down, plugged the router back in, and when he came back he blasted his TV again. I finally knocked on his door until he heard, told him to shut up and called him an asshole. I don't necessarily regret it - I don't think I'm wrong - but it feels childish to have to unplug the router or whatnot so I can sleep. Am I being an asshole here?  If so, is there anything else I can do or a better way to handle this? I feel like I'm ready to tear my hair out living with him.",

            "input": "My brother and I were raised by our grandparents and turned out very normal I guess. My parents raised my sister and they had very different conflicting parenting styles (they are now divorced which seemed to stem from my sister's problems) which essentially resulted in her never getting diciplined for anything ever. The results have been a 7th grader who has about 2 full blown temper tantrums per day, bullies her peers, ignores (literially pretends she doesn't hear) anything she disagrees with, is completely self centered and doesn't try to hide it, and is very materialistic. No one in my family wants to be around her, even my parents. \n\nSome examples of her behavior: she tried to stab me twice growing up, my brother once, and my mom once. She kicks my cat to get to me. She will ask my mom to buy her things everywhere she goes and when my mom says no she will have full blown tempertantrums in the middle of the store. She says that she hates everyone behind their back (my dad's girlfriend, my mom, my boyfriend, my brother) just for attention. She looks under the tree at christmas and sees that she has one less present than the rest of us and then throws a fit because of it, etc. My mom started drinking heavily at least in part because of her, and my dad was borderline emotionally abusive to me to take out his frustration for over three years. \n\nToday we celebrated christmas at my mom's house, and a large chunk was tainted because of her behavior. My boyfriend, brother, and I are all back home from school for the break and wanted to spend time with my mom but she turned it very negative. It's my mom's first christmas after a divorce and she has no one to spend it with, and my sister didn't even care about how selfish she was being. Once we got home I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend being sad because of how it turned out, and my dad saw me and wanted to get me to talk about it. We talked for a second, just mentioned that my sister was rough today and it kinda sucked. What he said boiled down to \"she just wants to be included and I know it's hard to include her but it's important to understand\" which is true, (I'm not trying to call my dad out for this) that is the reason for her outbursts, but at the same time when she has such bad behavioral issues it feels impossible to be around her at all. This is an assholeish thing to say but honestly I wish I wasn't related to her at all. \n\nI guess the core \"am I the asshole\" is I am away at college all year, and I have the option to spend breaks with my boyfriend's family. I love my family (excluding my sister), but every time I come back I feel awful because I truly can't stand to be around her. I don't want to talk to her. I don't want to text her back when she texts (and I haven't been), I don't want to try to be friendly, I don't want to be the \"good big sister\" anymore. I tried that for years and all it got me was anxiety, abuse, and loss of friendships from people not wanting to be around her. I don't want to be her sister at all. Don't want her to visit me, don't want her to come to my graduation, don't want her to be in my wedding if I get married, don't want her to be around my kids if I have them. I want to tell my parents that I am distancing myself because of her, but my dad has always said that family has to come first, and he stopped talking to his own mother for a while because she didn't invite my sister to a family dinner. My plan is a bit more serious. I would only visit for short periods of time and stay where she isn't. I would also not communicate in answers more than \"yes and no\" with her unless it would disrupt someone else in my family. AITA for trying to get away?",

The guys tend to give each other nicknames and call each other different things, often light-hearted, without any bad intention. We all really seem to appreciate each other there and if there's a problem for some reason, it's public.\n\nWhen I was pretty new to the job, my co-workers found out pretty early on I was largely an introverted person. I think this has changed a bit, but this make me stand out a lot in the group. \n\nAt one point, my co-workers were calling me the \"school shooter\" for reasons I could only discern as me being introverted. I'm well past high school age and I didn't even stay in college, and I'd never had the intentions to be a shooter. It was certainly a weird nickname for them to give me, but I never did find the reason behind it.\n\nOne day, we were outside in front of customers, and my co-workers were ragging on me as they sometimes do. They were calling me the \"school shooter\" in front of complete strangers. I really didn't like that, and I already didn't like the nickname at all.\n\nAfter we got back inside to our 'office' I began telling the guys how I felt about the nickname and I told them, not asked, to stop calling me that. A couple were a bit taken back, with one of them just leaving the room entirely. In my mind, I think I was justifiably mad about the nickname and the incident. After all, who wants to be called a school shooter?! It just seems so horrible in my mind.\n\nAm I the asshole for ruining my co-workers fun? Or am I justified for trying to defend myself and make sure I wasn't associated with something horrible?",

I don't usually do stuff like that cause it makes me nervous but she seemed cool and like someone I'd get along with, and the conversations we had while messaging were interesting and I'm trying to make new friends so! I said sure.\n\nWe got coffee the next day and basically she kind of just talked AT me for two hours, it was a little overwhelming cause I'd ask about her art and she would end up telling me about something really personal from her childhood, etc. She's a good story teller so it was interesting but she didn't really ask me questions or engage in stuff I said except to start talking more. It ended, it was fine, we went our own ways and she left town that night. \n\nThen the next day, today, she said some cryptic stuff about wanting to see me again if she 'was still around'. I thought she was a cool person, but wasn't realllyyyy planning on trying to hang again, but I felt like I needed to make sure she was okay. Basically she told me she was planning on committing suicide, I talked her out of it for awhile, now she's going to go maybe check herself in to some inpatient situation cause she's really in a bad spot, so that's cool! Crisis averted.\n\nSo now, she is saying 'if she makes it' she wants to hang out with me again and that I seem like I'm 'really worth knowing' (red flag! /s) and I don't want to like, lead her on by saying that I want that too, and then disappoint her later when I don't follow up or anything, but also she's in a fragile brain space so I don't think I should just say no thanks, I feel like either way I'm kind of the asshole? I just feel like she's really intense already for how little we know each other, and I don't think it would be a sustainable or healthy friendship for me to pursue. I think she feels more of a connection than I do, probably cause she told me her whole life story over coffee yesterday. I think I'm going to just try to be as supportive as I can but not really make myself that available to hang and kinda let it fizzle away..\n\nSorry for the novel, but AITA?",

We were way better and connected more as friends, however he didn't \"agree\" with homosexuality and we got in a couple arguments about it, but it was one if the straw that broke the back to that friendship. \n\nMy best friend/cousin is a Christian and never expressed any type of disinterested in me being bi or any type of disliking towards gay people\n\nNow here we go: I met this Christian boy through my high school band program. He's homeschooled, a grade higher than me, and I only see him in band and after school Thursday rehearsals first period in the morning. I had no problems with him and we've even had peaceful biblical discussions and talked about his grandma being a Jehovah's Witness, and it was kinda nice being around him. \n\nSo two days ago (8 periods at my school so A and B days) in the morning were waiting in the band teacher to come open the doors. While outside I start joking around, and he doesn't really get my sarcasm/jokes so I tell him not to take it seriously and throw it back at me. After he said OK the conversation went like this:\n\nMe: OK. Now let's agree you're a racist, sexist, homophobe.\nHim: *laughs* You know, I was almost jumped last year for saying I don't agree with homosexuality.\nMe: *laughs in case it's a joke* You're just kidding, right?\nHim: No I don't actually agree with it.\nMe: What? Why?\nHim: I believe it's wrong because the Bible says it's wrong. (exact words, no this isn't a movie script)\nMe: *walks away without a word*\n\nI -kinda shamefully- immediately blocked and deleted his number, along with blocking him on Instagram and making him unfollow me. So today I refuse to do our usual talking in the morning, and after school as we were finishing putting up stands and chairs he walks up to me (don't remember exact words except the last thing he said so he's a close version of what happened):\n\nHim: Are you OK?\nMe: *slightly aggravated tone that pretty much carried out throughout the conversation* I'm fine\nHim: *concerned* illiteratetrash if there's a problem you can tell me\nMe: so you're really gonna pretend like you didn't say that homophobic thing earlier?\nHim: Listen, I'm not homophobic, OK? I just don't necessarily agree with it. \nM: I'm not doing this again. I've dealt with Christians that thought like that, no, I just can't do this again.\nH: But I'm not homophobic. I have gay friends, and I love my gay friends, I just don't agree with it. \nM: That's the thing you don't like it\nH: It's not like I hate people but I'm not gonna pretend like what they're doing is alright. (exact words, I swear this isn't a soap opera)\nM: I'm not doing this to myself. I'm bisexual I'm not gonna deal with someone who thinks like that. No. \n\nI leave for my bus a few minutes after that. Now that I'm reflecting on it about a few hours later I feel bad. I told my sister and she laughed at it saying \"Sounds familiar.

Our house and furniture were covered in hair from the cats, which to some people may not be a big deal, but I am not used to having pet hair everywhere and it really bothers me. My mother gave me a very nice, expensive couch for the apartment, and the cats would scratch the shit out of it. His dumbass friend would always come over, theyâ€™d get high, and theyâ€™d hike the cats between their legs like footballs. It terrified them but they were convinced â€œthe cats like it, dude.â€?

He never ended up coming home from the shelter with the cat, but heâ€™s been sulking like a child and giving me the cold shoulder. Which is his normal behavior when heâ€™s mad. \nDoes he have any right to be angry with me? And did I overstep boundaries by forbidding he get the cat? \n\n\nSorry for this long ass post. ",

Their haircuts are also great and relatively quick.\n\nThe one problem is the insane wait times because they're walk-in only.

I got there like five minutes before open and there were at least four other parked cars with dudes just waiting and watching the door for when they flipped the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open.\" I see a guy get out of his car and begin waiting by the door, so I immediately get out and do the same. They open the doors and the guy ahead of me is hanging up his coat and I see that my favorite barber is working today, so I bolt for her chair while the other guy is still hanging up his coat. I don't think much of it, because there's still another chair open for him, and the two of us--the first two in line--will get to have our hair cut first.\n\nBut then I sit down and get situated and from my mirror I can see that guy that had been ahead of me sitting in the waiting area, looking PISSED. Someone else must have done exactly what I did and bolted past him and secured a chair while he hung up his coat. So I have to wonder, AITA for zooming to my barber's chair and not waiting for him to get situated, possibly giving someone else the idea to do the same thing?",

            "input": "My girlfriend and I met at university, and have been dating for two months, and have been having a hard time over the Christmas Holiday. We live about 7 hours away from one another, and will not see each other for about a month, which is okay; she adores her family and I don't want to intrude on her Christmas holiday. The issue here is that I do not adore my family, and I find living with them burdensome and stressful.\n\nFor context, my Mother has dementia, but has always been stubborn and narcissistic, and whilst my Father adores her he has no clue how to handle her, and she emotionally abuses him to tears. My Father himself does not know how to handle my Mother, and often gets angry and starts to shout at her. I haven't seen them in about 3 months and they've both gotten worse, meaning that living here over Christmas was a massive shock to me.\n\nAs a result of this, I have spent the majority of my holiday either in my room all day, or ouside the house. My girlfriend knows this. If she asks me how my day has been, I answer honestly, and say that today has been boring / tough / upsetting, and of she asks I elaborate on whatever arguement happened that day. \n\nI think because of this we end up texting way more than we should be, we run out of things to talk about. Furthermore, as we are texting than talking face to face, we can't convey exactly what we feel when we say something, meaning I think she is under the impression that I am constantly upset while i'm here, then that is only really confined to when I'm having to deal with my parents.\n\nLast night, my thoughts are verified. She is upset that I've spent my day in my room, saying \"Just so you know, in this house spending time just in your room isnt something people do much\". I reply with \"Yeah, and in this house, enjoying time with other people isnt something you do much\". From here, we both take a moment and then say that we have stuff to think about. We no we're both upset, I feel I was rude and thoughtless in what I said. I reply later on, apologising for the comment, that it were unnecessary.\n\nShe replies afterwards- she says that that's not why she is upset. She is upset that she hasn't enjoyed this holiday like she normally would, and its because she knows that I'm not enjoying my holiday. She hates the thought that she dislikes me telling her about my problems, and she says that what she feels is callous, and mean, and she says she is sorry for it. I understand, since coming home the amount of times I needed to talk to her because I was upset was almost daily.\n\nShe goes quiet for about half an hour before returning. She's argued with her mum, which is rare. She is extremely upset, and feels she can't talk it to me because she feels she has let me down. She says that she's thought about it, and she needs some time to think, and that she would not message me for a while.\nI want to be there for her, if she has argued with her mum. Their arguement eclipses ours in importance. Yet, she obviously doesn't want to talk to me right now, she needs someone else, like her best friend.\n\nI'm conflicted on what to do regarding the rest of this holiday and the relationship as a whole. I feel like I have been a completely different person over the holiday, and she's been made fully aware of that fact because we message for hours on end. I know that this current issue will be swiftly resolved when I go back to university on January 5th, and meet her (and her family, for the first time) on January 12th. Nevertheless, I know what we have both handled this horribly, and I don't know how to approach the subject of my family with her from now on.\n\nShould I have to tread carefully about the topics I talk about when I'm in a relationship, when we've already agreed to speak our mind and say when we're upset? Am I the asshole for putting this pressure on her over her holiday, when I know what she is with her family? Are there any red flags here things I need to think about or watch out for? How could we approach talking about things we're struggling with without putting pressure on one another?\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile)",

Hollywood movies there are in English, but subtitled in Chinese, and I take seat in the movie theater.\n\nTwo seats down from me is this Chinese grandmother, at least 65 years old (possibly older) and next to her away from me are what I believe to be her two teenage grandchildren. The movie starts and this woman STARTS NARRATING EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE... I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese so I understand everything she said, although I'm sure it's just as irritating otherwise. So for the whole time, it was like this...\n\n(In Mandarin Chinese)\n\n\"Oh, she's climbing the cliff\"\n\n*2 second pause*\n\n\"Oh, she's singing\"\n\n*2 second pause*\n\n\"Oh, she's splashing the water\"\n\n.... and on and on and on, and it did NOT stop at all. Because it's an old lady, I tried to ignore it. But after an hour of this nonstop, I reached my breaking point, turned to face her, and said somewhat angrily (in Mandarin Chinese)\n\n\"Excuse me, I'm trying to watch the movie, could you please shut your mouth?!\"\n\nImmediately she goes silent and no longer talks and I start feeling mortified. I could've worded it so much better and gentler but it just slipped out the way it did. I just finished watching the movie and left.\n\nDon't kill me, but from my experience as a half-White and half-Asian person, being quiet in a movie theater is more of an etiquette in the West compared to China, so maybe I'm mad at someone for cultural differences they can't really control? Also, I wondered if maybe her grandkids needed the narration (out of perhaps, blindness maybe), but they seemed completely able bodied so it might just have been a personality quirk. \n\nI dont know, I've been wondering about that since.

I was asking why it was important to do yoga today, and why not just go any other time in the week.

We opened the door and a super friendly stray cat came up to us and wanted to be pet. We were cautious but gave it attention. It was declawed and extremely skinny so we figured it had been a house cat in the past. The next day it was still outside our house, so I went and bought some cat food and we posted the cat on our neighborhood facebook page. No luck finding the owner. Then I decided to ask my neighbors if it was their cat, and they said that he had been missing for 2 weeks but they didn't want to bring him in the house yet because they didn't want to give fleas to their other pets. This sounded okay at first but now it sounds weird, especially since the cat was declawed and malnourished. It has no way to fend for itself outside, and it is cold here at night, around 30 degrees F. They also have a responsibilty to care for that cat since they are the owners, right? Anyways, I didn't see the cat for a day so I thought they took him back in. But he turned back up today, meowing at my back door. I went and tried to tell my neighbor but they wouldn't answer the door. I tried again an hour later and the cat followed me to their door, so I picked the cat up to give it to them. They finally answer the door after I wait for a few minutes, and the cat starts freaking out when he  sees the owner and clawing me up. The owner grabs the cats back skin, not even the scruff, and kinda tosses him in the house saying he doesnt know what hes going to do. It was a really weird experience, and it made me think that the owners were abusive. AITA for bringing a possibly abused cat back to the owners?

I love my partner more than anything in the entire world and I could not picture my life without her. Haley and I have been together for about 4 years. When I was much younger I dated a woman named, Marie. Marie and I met and instantly clicked and what I thought was us getting on like a house on fire quickly became one of the most intense and darkest relationships of my life. It was abusive on both sides and not healthy at all. I believe itâ€™s safe to say it was highly toxic and codependent but the draw was magnetic to say the least. Once Marie and I ended things we didnâ€™t talk for several years, up until about 2 years ago, when she reached out seemingly out of the blue. I had been to therapy and worked out a lot of my issues (many of which revolved around my sexuality) and she had to. While catching up we both made amends for what had happened and seemed to move on with our lives. \n\nHaley knows all of this and was supportive in me getting closure on what was a terrible time in my life. I even showed Haley every message as it came in. At the end of the conversation with Marie Haley said she felt that it was great I got closure but asked me to sever the relationship permanently. I agreed. \n\nOnto the present: Marie has reached out again maybe about 3 months ago and we have talked every day since. Sometimes itâ€™s about small trivial things and other times itâ€™s about tougher emotional things. Marie was recently there for me about a death in the family- this was a family member she was particularly close to when we were together. At first I told Haley about the conversation and she brushed it off as sort of a do what you want but donâ€™t tell me thing but I could tell it made her uncomfortable. I donâ€™t want to stop talking to Marie and I really consider her to be one of my closest friends at this point, at the same time I donâ€™t want to hurt the trusting and loving relationship I have with my wife.
