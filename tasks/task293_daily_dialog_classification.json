But we won't have enough time for dinner .      Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ?      Ah ... I fancy going to the later show .      Then , there's a 9:30 show .      That's Okay , I think .      All right . ",

This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !      It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score .

I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this .      Ok . What else ?      They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?      I see . What about the salary ?      Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience .

He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ?      I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?      Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ?      I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?      Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime .      That would be nice . Can you read the characters ?      I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character .      I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . ",

        "input": "Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .      I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .      What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?      Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .      Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?      There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .      Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .      I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .      What are your strengths and weaknesses ?      My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .      Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .      I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .      When do you find a job satisfying ?      My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .      How would your coworkers describe you ?      First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .      Do you have any questions ?      Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? ",

It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival .      My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month .      What do you think we can see during the festival ?      I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations .      I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park .      Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows .      Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . ",

And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney .      Mm-hm . How long were you there ?      I was there for almost a year .      Oh , OK .      And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .      So , did you , did you lose your finger ?      Almost .      Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .      Exactly .      Will you be going back to Australia soon ?      I'd like to go and live there for at least another year .

English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .      Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye .      Which team do you back then ?      I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .

People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties .      Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money .      I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing .      You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ?      Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ .      Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish .      Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . ",

The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president .      But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . ",

Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation .      If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ?      I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility .      Are you able to operate the telex ?      Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information .

        "input": "Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies .      Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?      I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .      I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .      I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .      Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .      In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?      It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .      Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?      If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .      It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .      We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .      If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .      That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that ",

I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ?      Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments .

Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .      When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .      That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .      I heard about that .

In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ?      Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you .

You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ?      You can say that .      But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?      They must have mixed hackers with crackers .      What is crackers then ?      There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them .      So they are two totally different concepts .      Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end .      I see .

What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?      A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist .

Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .

I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work .      Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ?

Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy .      OK . What are your strong points ?      Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point .      And your weaknesses ?      I think I sometimes try to be over-organized .

So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background .      Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology .      Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?      Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service .      Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle .      Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction .      Interesting ...      Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . ",

Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ?      Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .      I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .      Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller !      Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche .      How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .      You have always been so soft , Dave !      Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out .      Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! ",

If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .      I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?      One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !      When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?      You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .      What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?      One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .      So I need plenty of space for this exercise .      Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .      Great . Thanks for you advice ! ",

Well , every stamp has a story to tell .      You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps .      Good .      Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections .      There's a lot to share when you have a common interest .      Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors .      Ok , good luck . See you      See you , Frank . ",

Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive .      Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . ",

Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .      I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?      Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .      No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .      I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . ",

Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there .      Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ?      Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit .      Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ?      Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry .      Feed them ?      Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts .      And then later everyone eats the food ?      Yes ! How did you guess that ?      It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ?      Good Point !      But no dressing up like ghosts , right ?      No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? ",

I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine .      Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ?      Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . ",

The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing !      Would you want to live there ?      I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own .      What's your dreamhole like then ?      My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England .      Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?      Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important .      Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ?      No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !      I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?      No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! ",

In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .      In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?      That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul .      I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?      If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .      There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?      Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football .      The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?      Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon .

And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .      I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes .

I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .      Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .      Great . I'll get our plan started right away .      Can we start tomorrow though ? ",

Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .      But you taught children , yes ?      Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .      They actually study after school ?      That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .      Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?      Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .      Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that .      So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention .      But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .      As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .      Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ?      That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too .      Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?      I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing .

It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .      Www , man !      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ?      I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous .      So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ?      They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . ",

But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs .

So , we become involved .      I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out .      As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . ",

There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?      I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long .

Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?

I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .      That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .      What's to come next ?      If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing .      How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?

To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?      I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .      Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .      Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .      But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?      Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .      I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?      That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .      Really ?      Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .      Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?      Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .      How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?      That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .      So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?      Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .      Why did they want to found a college ?      Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .      Oh , I see .      Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .      When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?      In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .      It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .      Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .      Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .      Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .      I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .      Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .      That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .      You can ask me any question at any time . ",

What do you mean ?      Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .      But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .      Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .      I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .      Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .      So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?      It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .      And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?      Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .      Why ?      That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .      Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .      It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .      I want to look in the papers today .

Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet .      Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ?      Just press into it gently with your thumb .

If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force .      It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .      Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .      How do you think they could be ended ?      I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .      So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .      It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .      Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .

Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .      That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .      That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?      Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .

My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .      Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .      It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .      Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .      That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .      And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .      Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .      Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .      They do , but it doesn't help too much .

Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .      I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .      You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .      A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .      Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .      I got you . Next time .

I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?      Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .      I know it is quite different from Western chess .      Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .      But isn't it the same with wiki ?      Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . ",

She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise .      Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .

I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class .      I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class .      Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages .      Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses .      Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses .      But isn't it too impolite to be absent ?      What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government .      Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note .      Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record .      Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious .      I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government .      You can't write with one hand and draw with the other .      I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note .      You can count on me . ",

I find is so hard to choose the right gift .      my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b      that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?      most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help      so , what did you get them ?      I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems .      what ’ s wrong with is ?      she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise .      household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .      I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year ",
