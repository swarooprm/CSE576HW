Notwithstanding this independent impeachment value, these factors also develop a link between the shared insurance and Dr. Butcherâ€™s bias against this malpractice claim. They demonstrate that Dr. Butcher is no average, passive policyholder, but instead a practitioner very concerned with the affairs of his insurer. See Wallace, 949 S.W.2d at 626 (<HOLDING>).

charges the current principal balance and all payments received  so that we may determine the exact amount needed for tender see fac  52 ex 7 and that because wachovia did not respond plaintiff was not able to tender the exact and definite amount even though the court chooses to assume on this motion that such information would not also be in the hands of a typical reasonable borrower there is still no allegation in the fac of any ability to tender any amount whatsoever5 the full relevant paragraph of the yamamoto opinion statesas rescission under  1635b is an ongoing process consisting of a number of steps there is no reason why a court that may alter the sequence of procedures after deciding that rescission is warranted may not do so before deciding that rescission is warranted when it finds that assuming grounds for rescission exist rescission still could not be enforced because the borrower cannot comply with the borrowers rescission obligations no matter what such a decision lies within the courts equitable discretion taking into consideration all the circumstances including the nature of the violations and the borrowers ability to repay the proceeds if as was the case here it is clear from the evidence that the borrower lacks capacity to pay back what she has received less interest finance charges etc the court does not lack discretion to do before trial what it

tila rescission does not mean an annulment that is definitively accomplished by unilateral pronouncement but rather a remedy that restores the status quo ante7 of course that does not mean that we limit ourselves to the provision in perfect isolation we must instead construe that provision with the statutory scheme in which it is embedded in re bce west lp 319 f3d at 11708the court notes that language in a great many cases appears garbled admittedly because cases speak of equitably conditioning the rescission even though what they really are talking about is equitably modifying the conditioned procedural order in which tila says a rescission will place see eg fdic v hughes development co inc 938 f2d 889 890 8th cir1991 but as previously discussed while not a model of clarity in some respects the statutory and regulatory language at issue do seem to state fairly clearly irrespective of whether or not a security interest is terminated before or after a tender that money received by borrowers shall be tendered back at some procedural point9 one allegation by plaintiff deserves a more detailed response in this regard first plaintiff makes a serious allegation that the promissory note and the deed of trust for the mortgage transaction listed different amounts see fac  21 stating the amount of the loan in the note dated february 21 2008 was 44000000 the amount secured by the deed of trust dated february 21 2008 was 55000000 see also fac  19 62 this might appear to rise to the level of fraudulence required for equitable tolling though it is unclear whether it would represent a tila violation still plaintiff calls this the most glaring tila violation of defendants october 5 opposition 615 even to the extent such a discrepancy would relate to a tila violation and even to the extent if so that it would not have been apparent at the consummation of the transaction hubbard 91 f3d at 79 plaintiff has attached the purported note exhibit 2 and the purported deed of trust exhibit 3 to her fac and these documents controvert the alleged facts in the fac a court may disregard allegations in the complaint if contradicted by facts established by exhibits attached to the complaint see eg sumner peck ranch 823 fsupp at 720 the attached deed of trust in fact shows an original principal amount of us 44000000 plus accrued and deferred interest and such other amounts as stated in the note fac exhibit 3 deed of trust part 1d the note likewise is a promise to pay us 44000000 called principal plus interest and any other charges incurred during the course of the loan fac exhibit 2 page 1 the 55000000 referenced by the deed of trust is the maximum aggregate principal balance secured by this deed of trust which is 125 of the original principal note amount fac exhibit 3 deed of trust p 1 this is the analogue provision to paragraph 3f of the note which provides my unpaid principal balance can never exceed 125 of the principal i originally borrowed fac exhibit 2 p 3 paragraph 3f consequently even to the extent a plaintiff would not notice such a discrepancy at the time of consummation of the transaction the facs allegations thus contradicted do not give rise to the sort of fraud that might toll the limitations period10 plaintiff also cites nonbinding outofstate and outofcircuit authority in the fac rather than in her

an adequate pleading of a breach of a term of contract the plaintiff  may not plead a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing thus if the court were to find that alaska law governs the characterization of plaintiffs cause of action then it would likely fall outside the scope of the policys choiceoflaw provision while if the court were to find that new york law governs the characterization of plaintiffs cause of action it would fall within the provisions scope  which somewhat curiously would mean that alaska law would then govern the question of whether plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for the implied covenants breachwhile the answer is not perfectly clear it appears as though the courts obligation to apply new york law to determine the scope of the contractual choiceoflaw clause lehman bros 414 f3d at 333 encompasses an obligation to apply new york law to determine whether a cause of action is contractual or tortious in nature for the purpose of analyzing whether that cause of action falls within the clauses scope in commerce  industry insurance company v us bank national association another court in this district was presented with a similar question under similar facts there the defendants counterclaimed against the plaintiffs both of which were insurance companies for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay 2008

resolution id at 3 the parties disputefd whether this clause coverfed defendants bad faith claim  id at 4 after noting that new york courts are generally reluctant to construe choice of law provisions broadly and that extracontractual claims such as tort claims that arise only incidentally to the contract were not covered by the choice of law clause the court then looked to new york law to determine whether defendants badfaith claim was best characterized as contractual or tortious id at 4 internal quotation marks omitted the court held that new york law considers the duty to act in good faith as controlled by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing found in every contract and that therefore a bad faith claim is treated as a breach of the underlying contract for the purposes of applying a choice of law provision id internal quotation marks omitted collecting cases the court further noted that the basic holding of the cases to which it had cited that the same states law should govern both the contract and bad faith claims applies with equal force where the choice of law for the contract dispute is determined by a contractual choice of law provision id at 5 an unnecessarily confusing situation would result if different laws were to govern the contract and bad faith claims id internal quotation marks omitted reasoning that the breach of contract and bad faith claims are inextricably intertwined and should be governed by the laws of the same state and noting that new york law governs the claim for breach of contract the court concluded that new york law should also apply to the bad faith refusal to pay claim relating to these contracts idwhile apparently applying though not always explicitly citing to new york law other courts within this district have taken a similar approach both before and after commerce see eg torain v clear channel broad inc 651 fsupp2d 125 138 sdny2009 the court will apply texas substantive law to determine

claim is not a difficult one this court has little doubt that if  illinois law governs the contract  it is no jump at all to find that any efforts to engraft implied terms into the agreement  should be measured under the law of illinois the court finds the reasoning of these cases to be persuasive as a result it applies new york law to find that alaska law applies to plaintiffs cause of action for violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealingb analysisas explained in the conflict of law analysis above there is an actual conflict between new york and alaska law on this issue and alaska law controls the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in all contracts in alaska casey v semco energy inc 92 p3d 379 384 alaska 2004 generally speaking claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing are contract claims as under new york law the alaska supreme court has explainedin the case of an ordinary commercial contract between sophisticated business entities a tort for breach arises only when a partys conduct rises to the level of a traditionally recognized tort creating a broader tort remedy would disrupt the certainty of commercial transactions and allow parties to escape contractual allocation of losses therefore an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing sounds in contract alonestate dept of natural res v

municipality of anchorage v gentile 922 p2d 248 261 alaska 1996 insurance companies have been subjected to tort liability for breaching the covenant of good faith in resolving claims covered by their

natl am life ins co 128 ariz 188 624 p2d 866 868 1981 holding that tort liability applies when dealing with its insured on a claim the decision to extend a tort cause of action to these circumstances is based on public policy considerations unique to the insuredinsurer relationship in particular in allowing an insured to bring a tort cause of action for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the alaska supreme court has recognized the special relationship between insurer and insured the use of standardized contract terms the insurers superior bargaining position over the insured and the fact that the insured seeks protection against calamity rather than commercial advantage transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also nicholson 777 p2d at 1157 the adhesionary aspects of the insurance contract including the lack of bargaining strength of the insured the contracts standardized terms the motivation of the insured for entering into the transaction and the nature of the service for which the contract is executed distinguish this contract from most other noninsurance commercial contracts these features characteristic of the insurance contract make it particularly susceptible to public policy considerations alaska pac assurance co v collins 794 p2d 936 947 alaska 1990 due to the unequal bargaining positions which generally exist between insurers and insureds enforcement of this covenant is particularly important in the insurance context characterizing such actions between the insured and insurer as sounding in tort and thereby permitting tort damages will provide needed incentive to insurers to honor their implied covenant to their insureds citations and internal quotation marks omitted as amended on denial of rehg aug 30 1990 the alaska supreme court has reasoned that these exceptional features of the insurance contract justified the creation of a tort action for an insurers bad faith breach transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774in deciding against extending the tort cause of action to situations other than the ones described above the alaska supreme court has emphasized that the public policy considerations that formed the basis for extension of the tort cause of action were not present in other circumstances for example in municipality of anchorage v gentile the alaska supreme court considered whether there should be a cause of action in tort for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where the municipality of anchorage reduced the postretirement medical benefits of its retired police officers and firefighters 922 p2d at 252 in deciding against allowing a tort cause of action the alaska supreme court determined that pjublic policy concerns do not require the imposition of tort liability in this case id at 261 in particular the alaska supreme court reasoned that the underlying concern that warranted a tort cause of action is that without the threat of tort liability insurance companies may be encouraged to delay payment of claims to their insureds with an eye toward settling for a lesser amount than due under the policy id internal quotation marks omitted the alaska supreme court therefore held that the case law that allowed for a tort cause of action related to insurance contracts simply did not apply in that caseit is unnecessary to decide here whether the municipality would be subject to tort liability for failing to deal fairly and in good faith in the settlement of a covered insurance claim that is not the nature of the plaintiffs claim they instead claim that the municipality breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by unilaterally decreasing the insurance coverage required by the collective bargaining agreements although insurance is the topic in dispute the municipality breached the collective bargaining agreements not policies of insuranceid thus thealaska supreme court recognized that it was not just the subject matter of insurance that yields this tort cause of action but that special factors must be also be present and it also indicated an aversion to extending the cases providing for a cause of action in tort past the circumstances of those casesthe parties have not cited any case where an alaska court either applied pr declined to apply a tort cause of action for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in circumstances similar to the case at hand nor has the court found any such case in its own research in the absence of such authority and in light of the public policy considerations explicitly relied on by the alaska courts and persuasive authority from outside the district the court holds that plaintiffs cannot bring a separate claim for the breach of the implied covenant in this case the public policy considerations that alaska courts have relied on in other insurance cases are decidedly not present in this case simply put this is not a case where there are standardized contract terms where the insurer has superior bargaining power and where the insured seeks protection against calamity instead of commercial advantage see transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also ppm 3 purchase of the policy is suitable only for persons of substantial economic means and financial sophistication each policy owner will be required to represent that he or she meets certain minimum financial and other suitability standards while the contract is technically an insurance contract it is much more similar to an average commercial contract than to a typical insurance contract nor is this a case about an insurer resolving claims covered by its insurance policy see gentile 922 p2d at 261 the court also finds the reasoning in michael s rulle family dynasty trust v agl life assurance co no 10cv231 2010 wl 2721029 edpa july 7 2010 instructive in that case which is very similar to this case the eastern district of pennsylvania reasoned thatalthough insurance might play a tangential role here it is not the center of the dispute this claim revolves around the investment made as part of a life insurance policy and has nothing to do with the insurance aspect of the policy there is no allegation that agl failed to investigate a claim or that the plaintiff was in an unequal bargaining position and hence found itself signing a contract of adhesion additionally the plaintiff in this case is the rulle trust which is not a person nor is it the insured finally the agl ppm includes minimum suitability requirements for potential policy owners given the circumstances surrounding this policy it is not clear that alaska would recognize a tort for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing hereid at 13 citation

law  the plaintiff is required to plead as well a viable claim for breach of contract without an adequate pleading of a breach of a term of contract the plaintiff  may not plead a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing thus if the court were to find that alaska law governs the characterization of plaintiffs cause of action then it would likely fall outside the scope of the policys choiceoflaw provision while if the court were to find that new york law governs the characterization of plaintiffs cause of action it would fall within the provisions scope  which somewhat curiously would mean that alaska law would then govern the question of whether plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for the implied covenants breachwhile the answer is not perfectly clear it appears as though the courts obligation to apply new york law to determine the scope of the contractual choiceoflaw clause lehman bros 414 f3d at 333 encompasses an obligation to apply new york law to determine whether a cause of action is contractual or tortious in nature for the purpose of analyzing whether that cause of action falls within the clauses scope in commerce  industry

both of which were insurance companies for breach of contract and bad faith refusal to pay 2008 wl 4178474 at 1 one of the contracts in dispute contained a choiceoflaw provision which provided that the law of the state of new york would apply in the event that the parties disputed the validity or formation of the contract or the meaning interpretationf or operation of any term condition definition or provision of the contract resulting in litigation arbitration or other form of dispute resolution id at 3 the parties disputefd whether this clause coverfed defendants bad faith claim  id at 4 after noting that new york courts are generally reluctant to construe choice of law provisions broadly and that extracontractual claims such as tort claims that arise only incidentally to the contract were not covered by the choice of law clause the court then looked to new york law to determine whether defendants badfaith claim was best characterized as contractual or tortious id at 4 internal quotation marks omitted the court held that new york law considers the duty to act in good faith as controlled by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing found in every contract and that therefore a bad faith claim is treated as a breach of the underlying contract for the purposes of applying a choice of law provision id internal quotation marks omitted collecting cases the court further noted that the basic holding of the cases to which it had cited that the same states law should govern both the contract and bad faith claims applies with equal force where the choice of law for the contract dispute is determined by a contractual choice of law provision id at 5 an unnecessarily confusing situation would result if different laws were to govern the contract and bad faith claims id internal quotation marks omitted reasoning that the breach of contract and bad faith claims are inextricably intertwined and should be governed by the laws of the same state and noting that new york law governs the claim for breach of contract the court concluded that new york law should also apply to the bad faith refusal to pay claim relating to these contracts idwhile apparently

v semco energy inc 92 p3d 379 384 alaska 2004 generally speaking claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing are contract claims as under new york law the alaska supreme court has explainedin the case of an ordinary commercial contract between sophisticated business entities a tort for breach arises only when a partys conduct rises to the level of a traditionally recognized tort creating a broader tort remedy would disrupt the certainty of commercial transactions and allow parties to escape contractual allocation of losses therefore an action for breach of the implied

for the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in certain insurance contracts see municipality of anchorage v gentile 922 p2d 248 261 alaska 1996 insurance companies have been subjected to tort liability for breaching the covenant of good faith in resolving claims covered by their insurance policies see also state farm fire  cas co v nicholson 111 p2d 1152 1157 alaska 1989 holding

with its insured on a claim the decision to extend a tort cause of action to these circumstances is based on public policy considerations unique to the insuredinsurer relationship in particular in allowing an insured to bring a tort cause of action for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the alaska supreme court has recognized the special relationship between insurer and insured the use of standardized contract terms the insurers superior bargaining position over the insured and the fact that the insured seeks protection against calamity rather than commercial advantage transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also nicholson 777 p2d at 1157 the adhesionary aspects of the insurance contract including the lack of bargaining strength of the insured the contracts standardized terms the motivation of the insured for entering into the transaction and the nature of the service for which the contract is executed distinguish this contract from most other noninsurance commercial contracts these features characteristic of the insurance contract make it particularly susceptible to public policy considerations alaska pac assurance co v collins 794 p2d 936 947 alaska 1990 due to the unequal bargaining positions which generally exist between insurers and insureds enforcement of this covenant is particularly important in the insurance context characterizing such actions between the insured and insurer as sounding in tort and thereby permitting tort damages will provide needed incentive to insurers to honor their implied covenant to their insureds citations and internal quotation marks omitted as amended on denial of rehg aug 30 1990 the alaska supreme court has reasoned that these exceptional features of the insurance contract justified the creation of a tort action for an insurers bad faith breach transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774in deciding against extending the tort cause of action to situations other than the ones described above the alaska supreme court has emphasized that the public policy considerations that formed the basis for extension of the tort cause of action were not present in other circumstances for example in municipality of anchorage v gentile the alaska supreme court considered whether there should be a cause of action in tort for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where the municipality of anchorage reduced the postretirement medical benefits of its retired police officers and firefighters 922 p2d at 252 in deciding against allowing a tort cause of action the alaska supreme court determined that pjublic policy concerns do not require the imposition of tort liability in this case id at 261 in particular the alaska supreme court reasoned that the underlying concern that warranted a tort cause of action is that without the threat of tort liability insurance companies may be encouraged to delay payment of claims to their insureds with an eye toward settling for a lesser amount than due under the policy id internal quotation marks omitted the alaska supreme court therefore held that the case law that allowed for a tort cause of action related to insurance contracts simply did not apply in that caseit is unnecessary to decide here whether the municipality would be subject to tort liability for failing to deal fairly and in good faith in the settlement of a covered insurance claim that is not the nature of the plaintiffs claim they instead claim that the municipality breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by unilaterally decreasing the insurance coverage required by the collective bargaining agreements although insurance is the topic in dispute the municipality breached the collective bargaining agreements not policies of insuranceid thus thealaska supreme court recognized that it was not just the subject matter of insurance that yields this tort cause of action but that special factors must be also be present and it also indicated an aversion to extending the cases providing for a cause of action in tort past the circumstances of those casesthe parties have not cited any case where an alaska court either applied pr declined to apply a tort cause of action for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in circumstances similar to the case at hand nor has the court found any such case in its own research in the absence of such authority and in light of the public policy considerations explicitly relied on by the alaska courts and persuasive authority from outside the district the court holds that plaintiffs cannot bring a separate claim for the breach of the implied covenant in this case the public policy considerations that alaska courts have relied on in other insurance cases are decidedly not present in this case simply put this is not a case where there are standardized contract terms where the insurer has superior bargaining power and where the insured seeks protection against calamity instead of commercial advantage see transamerica premier ins 856 p2d at 774 see also ppm 3 purchase of the policy is suitable only for persons of substantial economic means and financial sophistication each policy owner will be required to represent that he or she meets certain minimum financial and other suitability standards while the contract is technically an insurance contract it is much more similar to an average commercial contract than to a typical insurance contract nor is this a case about an insurer resolving claims covered by its insurance policy see gentile 922 p2d at 261 the court also finds the reasoning in michael s rulle family dynasty trust v agl life assurance co no 10cv231 2010 wl 2721029 edpa july 7 2010 instructive in that case which is very similar to this case the eastern district of pennsylvania reasoned thatalthough insurance might play a tangential role here it is not the center of the dispute this claim revolves around the investment made as part of a life insurance policy and has nothing to do with the insurance aspect of the policy there is no allegation that agl failed to investigate a claim or that the plaintiff was in an unequal bargaining position and hence found itself signing a contract of adhesion additionally the plaintiff in this case is the rulle trust which is not a person nor is it the insured finally the agl ppm includes minimum suitability requirements for potential policy owners given the circumstances surrounding this policy it is not clear that alaska would recognize a tort for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing hereid at 13 citation and internal quotation marks omitted based on this reasoning and the reasoning in

however language in that case actually supports plaintiffs claim see alaska pac assurance 794 p2d at 946 agreeing with the argument that an insurer may be held liable for torts independent from its contractual duties such as fraud but that an action for negligence in breaching a specific contractual duty sounds in contract as defendant correctly argued in the context of plaintiffs breach of contract claim plaintiffs do not successfully allege the breach of a specific contractual duty rather they allege a negligence tort apart from the enumerated contractual duty to provide an annual

not allow tort claims based on purely economic loss see st denis 900 fsupp at 120004 it  appears that alaska cases foreshadow a general rule precluding negligence actions by those in privity where only economic losses are alleged however this appearance has been firmly rebutted in subsequent alaska supreme court decisions eleven years after the st denis decision the alaska supreme court heldwe have recognized that promises set forth in a contract must be enforced by an action on that contract only where the duty breached is one imposed by law such as a traditional tort law duty furthering social policy may an action between contracting parties sound in tort when a partys actions violate a general duty of care its actions may give rise to an action in tort even if the violation also

the same under new york law in reaching this conclusion the alaska supreme court in fact quoted the new york court of appealsa tort obligation is a duty imposed by law to avoid causing injury to others it is apart from and independent of promises made and therefore apart from the manifested intention of the parties thus a defendant may be liable in tort when it has breached a duty of
