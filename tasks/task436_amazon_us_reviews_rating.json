I have a specific regimen for installing screen protectors, and I will let you know how to install them every time, without bubbles OR dust.<br />Go into your bathroom, preferably the smallest in your house that has a shower. Turn your shower on HOT and let it run until the room is steamed up. THIS IS WHAT HOLDS ALL OF THE DUST DOWN! Next have a piece of scotch tape ready just in case. Make sure your hands are cleaned with soap. Remove the backing, align, and lay down from one end to the other. If you see a bubble, STOP immediately, pull back a bit and depending if it was just air keep going, if it was dust, use the tape to pull it off.<br />This method has worked for me flawlessly for the past 5 years. Hope it works for you too. Thanks Mr Shield!",

The outer case was also very nice, its a sort of durable, memory foam type of material.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased and it all seems to be in good quality. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy all these items separately- it's an amazing deal!

On Samsung's website their online suipport resolution for every issue to every product Samsung sells is to call their support line which I did. I started the phone call process approx. at 8pm EST. I had to go through close to 5 or 10 minutes of recorded phone tree options & listen to their garbage to be put on hold for over 45 more minutes after the phone tree BS. only to be hung up on by their reps because it was after 9pm when they finally started to pick up. So beware of samsung & their support because they are worse than reprehensable. I know phone calls can drop but I have worked customer support & know the difference in a dropped call & being hung up on as I was tonight by the pick up on the line then the click of the phone being hung up.

I, like other reviewers was a bit wary of this purchase, given the price compared with similar units, but this far exceeded my expectations.  I was even able to have my laptop sit atop my cooling pad in the mount without any problem, and the included heavy duty Velcro strips insure that my equipment is secure.  I love that there is a means to neaten up my cables, and that the laptop can come forward for working, and positioned back against the wall to open up desk space.

However, it does have a few slight, nagging problems that, in reality, would lead me to give it a 4.5 star rating. But based on Amazon's rating scale, I rounded up to 5 stars.<br /><br />This desktop set has a lot going for it.  The installation of the software was painless.  The wireless connection is simple plug'n'play with the USB dongle--the keyboard and mouse didn't even have to be sync'd up, it worked right out of the box.  It's nicely constructed and has a pretty sharp looking design.  The keys are ergonomic and comfortable for all-day use.  There are plenty of dedicated function keys that are clearly mapped out for things like the calculator and media center commands.  In addition, there are programmable keys up at the top of the board that let you assign any program or document to them.  You just hit the key and it asks you what you'd like to assign to it.  And for the ultimate test, I let a very non-techie friend borrow the keyboard for a week and she had zero problems installing it or assigning programmable functions to it.  It's a great desktop combo, and I would give it a full 5 stars if I had never used Logitech's Wave Desktop.<br /><br />So what are the shortcomings of the microsoft 6000?  The first thing that's a dealbreaker is the mouse--for lefties.  This is a right handed mouse.  The Logitech Wave Desktop has an ambidextrous mouse by comparison.<br /><br />The other minor problems are indeed, minor and somewhat personally picky.  First, the mouse scroll wheel glides freely when used.  I prefer a scroll wheel that has a click-step resistance so that I can scroll a specified 3, or 6, or 9 lines at a time.  Again, not a big deal, and more of a personal preference.  The final thing is the space bar.  The space bar is soft and has some \\\\\"lazy action.\\\\\"  It just doesn't bounce up quickly the way I'd like it to when I'm cruising along typing fast.  It's functional and very useable, just not a real 5-star perfect.<br /><br />So, overall, I'm a little torn.  I really, really like this keyboard/mouse and would give it 5-stars.  But since I've also tried out the Logitech Wave (you can check my Amazon review on that as well), I have to give that a 5-star rating and my full recommendation--especially for lefties.  If you prefer a free-scrolling mouse wheel, or a few more easy to use programmable buttons, then go with the MS Desktop 6000.just not a real 5-star perfect.    So, overall, I'm a little torn.

They're impressively bright and easy to adjust. My chair's in a darker corner of the living room and my laptop doesn't have backlit keys. I plug one of these into a USB port on the laptop and after a little adjusting to keep the glare off the screen and out of my eyes there's plenty of light to type and see even the small print on the function keys.<br /><br />On top of being a good task light on the laptop you can plug these into a portable battery charging pack and instant flashlight! I have a charging pack with dual USB ports plugging both in creates a blinding amount of light. At only 1.2w draw per lamp a good battery pack would last quite a while.<br /><br />Another use these would be handy for is if the dome/interior lighting in your car was inoperable. You could plug one or both of these lamps into a car's USB charging port for quick and you've got quick and easy interior lighting.<br /><br />Two features I would love to see added to these lights are a dimmer control the lights are very bright and sometimes you don't need the full output of the lamp. An on/off switch would be a useful if not entirely necessary feature. I wouldn't mind the option to leave the lamp plugged into the laptop when I didn't need light.<br /><br />One thing of note is on the opposite side from the lights there is a metal heat sink that does get quite warm. I tested the sink for a bit over an hour and while it didn't cause any burns it was warm enough that I wanted to stop touching it so give it a few minutes to cool down before handling or throwing it in your bag or pocket.",

Unlike the comment by another owner, this works with the Motorola SB5120 (my service provide is Cox cable, I tested this on my network before gifting it to confirm it works).  It's very flexible and the two main features to use it for is as a router or a wireless bridge which it does both well.      On it's ease of use, the only problem some people may have is an ip conflict with the modem, so the first thing you'll need to do is log into the router and change it's default ip address (changed it to 192.168.5.1 for my friend and backed up the settings), especially if you use dsl since it seems to have a conflict with the motorola dsl modem (ironically didn't have to do it with my cable modem).      How does it perform?  As a router it's decent and able to stream video but it's range is shorter than my far more expensive belkin n+ and it's lan ports are a tad slower than my older linksys wrtu54g-tm (tmobile branded).  As a wireless bridge I was able to survey about the same amount of wireless networks as the wireless n cards in both my laptop and netbook, and the only disappointment is when I connected my external antennae to it, which didn't provide any kind of range boost to see more networks like my rosewill rnx-easy4n 2t2r router used as a wireless bridge (the rosewill cost twice as much at the time).  When wireless bridging, using this as a lan access point, make sure the router connected to the internet is not setup to auto channel negotiation, otherwise if it chooses a less traffic channel the wireless bridges will periodically disconnect (as a wireless bridge it doesn't automatically change it's channel).  I do get the 150 speed closer to the router and less when further.  It also supports wpa2 when used as a bridge for the security conscious but won't do ddns as a wireless bridge (so the main modem connected router still has to be configured as such).    The manual is poorly written, the router defaults to the easy setup mode which doesn't help most beginner's on troubleshooting, and many of the features it has as menu options lack any details of what it can or will do when changed.  I think most manufacturers should explain into greater details of what some of the menus can do so people can maybe get more out of their router in the future.    Features on this router for the price is great.  The only thing it's missing is an usb port for connecting it to a printer, hard drive, or mobile network dongle.  It does more than most big name routers just because it gives you the option to use it as a wireless bridge and in the future it will be one of the determining factors for my future router upgrades.  Routers like this can hurt the broadband companies as neighbors may contemplate sharing their service since you can use this to connect to another person's network and then have it connected to another wireless router to share the service wirelessly with the rest of the people in that second home by making sure the wireless bridge in in the optimal position to connect to the modem connected router then using ethernet to position the second wireless router for the best distribution.",

It means when you're browsing a website and move your mouse down, the page scrolls a bit. When you're modeling something in SolidWorks and move your mouse quickly from one point to another, it zooms in/out. It seems like a minor thing, but it gets very annoying, VERY fast.<br /><br />The solution is to click the scroll wheel down to get it into \\\\\"clicky\\\\\" mode, but it's the worst scrolling experience ever I've ever had. It's very inconsistent--one click will sometimes scroll me down 100 pixels while the next click might scroll me down 40 pixels.

In this case the neighbor has a new 57MBs cable service.  We got 57MBs down and 11MBs up consistently on speedtest.net. I was thinking we could use MoCA adapters but it hit me that those can \\\\\"only\\\\\" go to 100Mbps,  and besides we needed network ports in more places.    I own the 100Mbps versions of ZyXel PLAs and have found them very useful to have in the bag of tricks. Those are a bit lacking when you stream video, but they work and sites like NetFlix eventually get enough data across to have good video quality.    So we chose these ZyXel 600Mbps PowerLine Adapters.    As with the 100Mbps versions, set up is fairly easy but you have to get the user manual on the included CD to see how to add more than a single paired PLA. (Spoiler: Press the Encrypt/Reset button on the first one for 1.5-3 seconds and then do the same on the second within 2 minutes.  They handshake and pair and then exit the pairing mode.)  The challenge is that you can only pair two PLAs at a time so you have pair 2, then pair a 3rd and 4th to one of those in separate steps.    Although the instructions say that you should have an ethernet cable connected on each side, I got the paring to work even by plugging the PLAs into the passthrough sockets of the other! Make sure you check the status lights and see the HomePNA lights are on.    I started out testing with a direct cable to the new router and then switched the link to the ZyXel 600 pair plugged in to separate outlets about 20 feet apart in the kitchen. The first test yielded 30MBs.  Repeated tests after that gave 40MBps, or ~320+Mbps, which makes sense if the claimed 600Mbps means 300Up+300Down full duplex..  NB: It's possible that the performance would be less if the PLAs are placed further apart or on opposite phases of the electric panel.    Consider that if you have devices with \\\\\"mere\\\\\" 100mbps 100BaseT Ethernet ports, like most video sources, the link between the PLAs will EXCEED the wire speed by multiples!    Being I've been around long enough to remember when we thought 1.5Mbps was screaming and Ethernet was 10Mbps, I hesitate to complain about 320Mbps.  It's certainly respectable performance on a (\\\\\"1000Mbps\\\\\") Gigabit LAN interface, BUT we get the full 57MBs with a 802.11n WIRELESS link to the PC nearby!    We don't know as yet how well wireless will hold up all over the house. We're keeping these 4 around to use as the reliable wired network where needed, like to the media equipment.    Bottom line:  If you want a FAST wired ethernet link where you have no wiring, these powerline adapters will bring it.",

The job looks like a professional or factory installation.<br /><br />The seller was very responsive and helpful when I discovered I ordered two of these brackets but I really needed one bracket for the PC and the matching adapter for the RAID Silo.  They did the exchange and did not charge me shipping charges the second time to send me the adapter and were very nice about everything.<br /><br />Retrofit costs:<br /><br />Older 4 hard drive SCSI RAID Silo on Craig's List $15.00, Internal to External eSATA 4 Port PCI Bracket and matching Internal to External eSATA 4 port Adapter with shipping $44.95, 8 standard 18 inch SATA cables with shipping $10.80,  4 standard 6 foot eSATA cables with shipping $23.99 and 2 Molex to SATA dual Y power adapters $12.99  Total: $107.73 -  Not bad!

Some rubber feet on the bottom or a non-slip surface would be nice. I also noticed that because the surface it's exactly flat, sometimes the laptop will rock back and forth as you type.

The boot time with my old HDD was about 5 minutes, and the boot time with this new drive is, well, about 5 minutes.  Yes, this is a pretty busy machine with lots of drivers, cloud connections, and etc.  But really, I've seen no appreciable difference.<br /><br />That's not to say that I've had any problems with this drive, and if you told me it was a nice HDD I'd agree with you.

Boot time from cold, same stuff with EVERYTHING loaded including cloud, scanner, you name it (drumroll please) went from over 5 minutes (SSHD) to just a hair over one minute (SSD).  Comments seen below notwithstanding, this nails it for me.  I have nothing in principle against SSHD hybrid drives, but they're only marginally (and in my case almost undetectably) better than a standard old 7200 HDD.  This is now the second older PC that I've upgraded with a true SSD, and the results are the same on both -- it's given new life to machines I was ready to trash.  BTW the 1tb 840 EVO was on sale for a brief moment for $350 at Amazon, and when the prices drop that low again I'm going to similarly outfit my wife's computer.  And YES you CAN absolutely measure this with a stopwatch.  You could almost measure the difference with an hourglass.  (Sorry, being a bit cheeky on that last comment).  Of course all of my apps and (for some reason) web pages are much snappier now.  True SSD is the right move, particularly now that prices have come down to Earth!f my apps and (for some reason) web pages are much snappier now.

The original package shipped a few wrong items but the seller kindly made a quick replacement. After exploring the kit for one week I would say I really love it.<br /><br />- The cloned kit gives a quick start on arduino. Yes it does not include some of the electronic parts offered by official kit, but it's far cheaper (1/3 of the official price).<br /><br />- With these items you can test a lot of ideas. Many sensors (include Light Sensor (Photocell), Temperature Sensor) helps you to realize your task, preliminary. When in need, it's easy to extend the kit. The seller has a lot of sensors/extensions for sell. you can look into that.<br /><br />- It's a good starter kit to learn new things. With this small kit in hand, you can get all benefits from the open source arduino, including software, board design sheet, source code, tutorials... These are all compatible. (The seller has a mini/micro starter kit at even cheaper price. But there're more documentations of uno. So if you are new to arduino, I still recommend this kit). Within one weekend, I already figured out how to develop programs on this microcontrollers, and familiar with every corner of arduino software internals. By the end of last week, I can already program this kit without using arduino library, but with raw avr libc to optimize the performance/energy consumption ratio.<br /><br />- Yes there's no instruction (well, the seller provides link to an ebook if you want). But who needs it? With abundant online information, it's easy to get familiarize with the circuit design. When in doubt, just google it.<br /><br />- The quality is good. Well you cannot compare this to the official arduino uno board design and manufacture, but it just works!<br /><br />This is a truely amazing product at very low cost. I also had a very good time talking to the seller. He's a nice guy, and solves quite a few my requests/problems.<br /><br />My two cents are<br /><br />- just write &#34;made in china&#34; on the board. There's nothing to shame about. China factories do produce good products (such as your iPhone)<br /><br />- Check before ship can save both time and money:)",

They made it pretty easy to get a replacement with a photo of the old cable destroyed (cut in half).  I still don't think I can give the 5th star for a non-certified cable even though they don't advertise it as certified, I will have to wait 1-2 weeks for the replacement which means you need a spare cable if you use this because it will inevitably stop working.",

I really liked the Smart Wifi app so I upgraded to the WRT 1900 thinking I would have better luck. Dead at 2 years, one month.  At first we had 1-3 minutes where the WRT  fell off cable modem, but it came right back up.  I assumed it was the internet coming into the house. Comcast came out, dug new line in yard, replaced the gateway. I reset my WRT and the next day the same thing.  Within a couple days it stopped working altogether.  Time to look into another brand. Original Review below:   I had owned a Linksys EA series router and decided to upgrade bc (1) the number of devices in our house has increased dramatically in the last couple of years and (2)there has never been good signal in our master bedroom, which is the furthest away from the router. On the old one I especially liked the parental control feature and the iPhone app.  So, after a bit of research, decided this WRT was the way to go. I have not been disappointed: super easy installation, love the windows based screens as I am not much of a command prompt user and the 5g AC wifi is super fast.  Amazon delivery was also surprising fast.  But, I did call the customer service about 4 days after installing it as I had a problem and didn't know what to do. I called the number on the box that was provided for initial help. I was very disappointed that the person who attended my call told me this was a very complicated router meant for a business application and tried to sell me a different router for $100 more.  I was very upset and told him I was calling for help not sales. He gave me another number where the gentleman helped me through a very simple solution.  This is the only reason I can't give the product 5 stars.",

While 5 hours is a bit high, for normal use 3 to 4 is a very rough range. Even so, 3 hours is a long longer than some PC laptops gets, such as my old Compaq Presario 2195US. Even more so than the long battery life, though, which in itself is amazing, is the seamless transition from running from the power adapter and running from the battery. Unlike the Compaq I mentioned before, in which XP would switch to the battery settings, dimming the screen and slowing it down (and even when I set it to maximum performance it still seemed slower) everything stays the same. No kidding. Unplug. No difference. Plug it in. The same thing. While trying to setup my wireless network, I forgot to plug it in, running off the battery the entire time without even knowing it. When I finally did, I was amazed that I wasn't running from the wall: it was exactly the same experience as when it was plugged in. So for that 4 hours you get the most amazing experience due, in part, to Mac OS X. <br /> <br />In terms of power--RAM, CPU, etc.--I am impressed. The standard 256MB RAM that comes with the computer is simply not enough, and I've had a few slow-downs even with an extra 512MB installed (for a total of 768MB RAM). Albeit I was running a dozen large applications, the point is that extra RAM is a must and that maxing it out is the best thing you can do, so long as you have the extra money to spend. It really makes a difference. As far as raw processor power goes, I found it a bit slow at first (though much faster than a 1.33GHz PC). My experience here is sordid, though, because I at first owned an 867MHz Rev. A PowerBook for about a month or so before trading it in for this Rev. C beauty. Regardless, whatever slowdowns I experiences at first are all but gone--or I've grown used to them. Either way, this thing runs like a Ferrari. <br /> <br />I can't really comment on its size and weight, as I have yet to carry it around with me much, but I will make a note of the screen size: despite it being merely 12\\\\\"--quite smaller than the 15\\\\\" screens I have been using on laptops for the past year--I was accustomed to it almost immediately. I remember using my mom's laptop at one point a week after buying this that looking at her 15.4\\\\\" widescreen was just.. I was thunderstruck at how large it was. Afterwards, I went back to my laptop, and saw a normal-sized screen. I was incredulous before making my purchase, people who said the screen was fine being quite unconvincing, but I have to say that they were absolutely right. You get used to it in an instant, and everything else is, well, huge in comparison. <br /> <br />And how quiet it is! I've never been one to be bothered by the sound of computer fans--though the ones in my old desktop were outrageously loud and annoying--and thought my old laptop to have been quiet, but after using a PowerBook for two months, I know better. I would classify my old Compaq as not loud, as it truly wasn't, but definitely not quiet. Quiet is this, my PowerBook. More than a few times I've made a reach for the power button, and even begun to press it, before I realized that it was asleep, usually brushing against my mouse and awakening the computer, the screen glowing as it came to life. That is quiet. <br /> <br />I simply must mention Mac OS X, even though it isn't a hardware part of the PowerBook. It has made my experience exponentially better. Though odd at first--I had to relearn how to make line breaks in IM clients, how to use the Command key as often as the Control key, and even learn the combos (Command+Shift+Letter, for instance)--it really has made computing more fun. I know it sounds corny, and at first it wasn't that way, but having grown used to it, seeing some of the applications out there, using them, etc., I couldn't be happier. On top of a different way of obtaining most apps--that is, paying for them via credit card and simply buying the CD key, then downloading the trial software and unlocking all the features--there is such a diverse selection to choose from. For instance, there's iComic, which, using Perl scripts, allows you to view [web]comics from within it, and even download them to your hard drive automatically. I don't know of any PC program that does this. As opposed to doing everything with one program, you have multiple, smaller, more efficient applications. For instance, instead of using Photoshop to slowly and painstakingly fade the ends of my images out to a white, I can simply set a template in, say, Yellow Mug Software's EasyFrame, drag all my files into it, and it'll do the same thing automatically. Which brings up arguably the best part: the widespread use of drag 'n' drop. The most basic and amazing use being that, when you want to open a file in a non-default program, instead of right clicking, going to Open with..., etc., you can simply drag the file to the application in question and drop it on it, automatically opening it in that application. <br /> <br />Overall, my experience with this PowerBook, and its OS, has been nothing short of stunning; amazing; the greatest computer experience of my life. Not only is it fun, but the OS is unparalleled and it finds the balance PC laptops can only dream of achieving: being portable without sacrificing performance.",

Many of the issues I had complained about--the pivot point, the ratcheting mechanism, the latch, and most of all the keyboard quality have been improved.  This keyboard is a delight to use now, and while I thought I would only use it for some time as you can't pop the iPad off, it has become my daily carry case.  I've even gotten used to setting it up, and carrying it one handed by the metal support piece.  Not the most comfortable way to carry it, but worth the minor inconvenience.  I can't speak to battery life yet, but I've had to recharge my iPad already and the keyboard is still going strong.

They were was supposed to replace a SPI FSP200-50PL-B 200W power supply that had failed, and the second one was intended to be a spare.<br /><br />The SPI 200W power supply that failed is used to run a a custom security equipment setup which includes a LCD monitor, finger print reader, RFID reader, a camera and a a couple of other items.  A total of 22 SDI power supplies are used in an identical setup, and they have been running for almost 5 years already 24/7, racking up about well over 40.000 hours of run time.  The first one just failed, so I figured replacing it with a power supply with a higher rating shouldn't be a problem, with a smaller load factor, it might last even longer.<br /><br />Set this Kentek power supply up running the same exact equipment, didn't work.  The LCD monitor would not turn on.  After doing some modifications to how the distribution board was set up, the LCD monitor finally started working.  Not sure how long this thing will last.<br /><br />It appears that this power supply simply can't handle the load and is poorly regulated, as there is a severe voltage drop on the 5V and 12V lines under load.  Note that the setup only uses the 5V and 12V lines.  The 200W SPI is rated 5V-15A and 12V-12A.  The 250W Kentek is rated 5V-15A and 12V-13A.<br /><br />Despite being rated higher, it was struggling to regulate the output, and I had to do some load balancing to make it work, vs the SPI runs the equipment completely stable without any issues.<br /><br />This power supply appears to be poorly designed, over rated at 250W and generally not worth its weight in scrap metal.  Returning the unused one and ordering a real KDM from a different supplier.<br /><br />Update 28 December 2012:<br /><br />The handling of this from Eboxdirect has been nothing short of pathetic.  No communication, no apologies, only thing I got when I returned this POS is a return label.

The most annoying part is that you can't lock it open; it keeps folding itself up when trying to hold it with one hand.the hinges can't be locked open.I was thinking of getting metal brackets and screwing the tray open and disabling the hinges. I need to look for a bed table that can be locked in open position and not flop around or fold up so easily.<br /><br />***update 11/19/12<br />I forgot to mention that i need it to stay in shape because i have to move it each time I use it. I've owned this for about 14 months and it's still holding up. I remedied the \\\\\"floppiness\\\\\" problem by zip-tying all four the leg hinges to lock in place. Just look for the tab on each leg and find a way to apply the zip-tie.  The other moving part i mentioned is the table top that folds in half.

This makes surfing much easier, as I don't have to move the mouse up to the top of the screen each time I want to go back or forward in the browser.<br />In addition, these extra buttons are essential for gaming!  Since you can program what the buttons do as often as you'd like, you can change the settings around depending on what game you are playing.  I like to use one of the extra buttons to reload my gun in shooting games.  That is just one of the possibilities of it however.<br />Overall, the functionality of this mouse is excellent.

Even the representative from Etekcity acknowledged it doesn't do what it's advertised to and nor can it even be programmed for one of the functions.<br /><br />Hi Beau,<br />Thank you for contacting us.  I am sorry to hear about the issue with your mouse.  Here's a link to download the software for this mouse: http://www.mediafire.com/view/8vbv51hcxbjt5ek/T-142_Software.zip<br /><br />Also, we've unfortunately found that the product documentation and description for this mouse was incorrect.  The sniper and rapid fire buttons are actually just standard mouse side buttons, and as such function as back/forward navigation by default.  While the software allows customizing the buttons, it doesn't seem that there's a way to enable the sniper mode as advertised, while setting the right side button to a double-click can somewhat emulate the rapid fire function.  We've since revised the product listing and user's manual, but I apologize for any inconvenience caused by our mistakes.  If we can help with anything at this time, please let me know.  Thanks.<br /><br />-Tyler<br />Etekcity Customer Support<br /><br />When you receive an email that says &#34;Hey it doesn't do it, and you might be able to program it to do it, but we know we are advertising it wrong.

I haven't touched the connection since I first installed the monitor so it was not a matter of \\\\\"wear\\\\\" from my part.<br /><br />I went through Samsung website for warranty (this monitor has 3 year parts/labor warranty) and they have a 90-day New replacement warranty so I got a new monitor shipped to me for free, and I just shipped my monitor back to samsung with the provided pre-paid package.  All in all very quick and easy warranty service (my monitor was on day 75).<br /><br />******************<br /><br />What this is not.  It is not an IPS screen made for color accuracy.  You can read other reviews regarding lack of height/rotation adjustments but it works just fine for me without them as this monitor is replacing my dying CRT.<br /><br />GAMES: I needed a monitor that could be fast enough to replace my 19\\\\\" Samsung CRT (which I had since CS 1.2) to play my favorite FPS games: Counter-strike, Team Fortress 2, Left for Dead 2.  And for FPS games you can't have any lag.  I was a little afraid that I would feel the lag, but thankfully I can still get my one shot Deagle HS kills on my rushes.  Sweet!<br /><br />MOVIES: Having lived with CRTs and a DLP projector in my living room, I just can't stand ghosting lags for movies (or fast sports like Ice-Hockey, Go LA Kings!) and I have to say I'm quite satisfied.  Connected through HDMI, 1080p blu-ray movies look amazingly sharp, and I can enjoy my Ice-Hockey without much ghosting.  I said \\\\\"satisfied\\\\\" because I can still tell there's a little ghosting compared to my DLP.  But it gets the job done.<br /><br />HDMI and Sound: This monitor doesn't have speakers but it has an SPDIF Optical line and 3.5mm line out so you can connect external speakers to it.  When you select the HDMI, the sound routes out through the line out.  When you switch to the DVI the sound shuts off automatically.<br /><br />My other monitor is a CINTIQ 21UX which is an IPS monitor (worth about $1800) and of course this PX2370 doesn't compare when it comes to color consistency and brightness from different angles.  Compared to my IPS screen, it was a little odd how the screen got brighter or darker depending on the height I looked at (just by moving up or down 6 inches).  But my IPS screen at 12ms is horrible for Games or Movies.<br /><br />If you're afraid of switching from a CRT to an LCD for games, I can assure you that this monitor will be good enough for your FRAG FESTS, and you won't have to haul around a 40 pound monitor!utomatically.

I found the 3G connection useful to buy new books, read the news from the major websites and send my files directly to the kindle.    I have just seen that there is a possibility to develop applications for kindle (still in beta), and since I am a computer engineer, I strongly believe that with some good apps, such as an organizer, a calculator and a notepad, kindle could be one of the best electronic device in the market.    I personally do not like comparisons with tablet, such as ipad, because they are not fair. Kindle is not a tablet (sort of computer) but a sort of electronic book. However, you should notice that the display of kindle with respect to ipad, is the best for reading without having headache in the middle of the night.

This is because it is the closest thing to a metal cage ever manufactured for use as a PC tower. Basically the entire upper-back portion of the case is a steel grating. Everything on your motherboard WILL be breathing fresh air at ALL times, and plenty of it. A big part of this is because the PSU is mounted on the BOTTOM, and thus isn't blocking heat from rising up and out, so instead of having a giant, hot electrical box on top of all your heat-generating components, you get two giant 140mm vents. Your drives will be getting plenty of air too with the 140mm blue-LED fan on the bottom and the fully ventilated optical drive ports, but I've never been hugely into cooling drives. Last but not least, it just looks sexy. This is a no-nonsense case in every sense of the word, however, because with all that air passing in and out there comes a lot of noise. All your fans will be heard loud and clear by anyone within fifty feet of them, and so if you're really up tight about noise (which I'm just not... at all) you should either prepare to pay an arm and a leg for super-quiet fans or get a case with some kind of noise-dampening features.    So in the end, it doesn't have plexiglass plating so you can spend your time staring at your motherboard's flashing RAM sticks, and it doesn't have giant, strobing LED lights all over its back parts, and it isn't rainbow colored with bright orange polkadots, but it has a thorough mastery of the fundamentals. Its simple, cheap, and just works and does its job WELL.",

I searched through various screen protectors and reviews on Amazon before deciding to purchase this product.  It arrived today and was super excited to apply it since I couldn't stand all the fingerprints and smudging on its currently-bare screen (purchased stylus pens also and those help a bit).<br /><br />Anyway, I took one of the two included protectors out of the packaging and noticed it had a long scratch on it.  I put it aside and decided to apply the other one instead which was fine.  I read the instructions on the back.  After using the included cleaning cloth to completely wipe away any fingerprints and dust, I gently peeled the first layer down about an inch and applied to the top of the screen, slowly peeling the rest off as I worked it down to eliminate any bubbling (reviews on these things prepared me for the bubbleage that was to be expected). Things seemed to be going well until the last part of the application:<br /><br />There was quite a long bubble in the last corner of an otherwise perfect application, and so I checked the packaging for the \\\\\"soft card\\\\\" that the directions say is included.  It was not, so I folded the cardboard packaging itself and used it as a makeshift de-bubbler.  This failed me in every way possible and I could just not get this forsaken bubble out!  I cleaned my screen so well before application that I think it was cleaner than it was once I took it out of the box for this first time.  Confused and bewildered by this defiant bubble, I removed the thing and proceeded to apply the second protector that had the scratch.  I had one or two tiny bubbles that irritated me (I'm a perfectionist and want ZERO bubbles) so I tried to smooth them out with my makeshift de-bubbler.  This failed yet again.<br /><br />Maybe there was a tiny speck of dust that I missed but I doubt it--that mother was clean as heckfire.  Even if it had applied flawlessly, it would have looked terrible because of the scratch.  Needless to say, my night is now saddened deeply.  It's like waking up Christmas morning to a new present, opening it and feeling all excited, then having it ripped out of your hands with Santa laughing as he says \\\\\"just kidding\\\\\".

The TV is on the other side of the house, separated by many walls. Our wifi input to the TV was through my son's Wii. I have been frustrated with stalled video streaming from Netflix and Amazon Prime, frequently being unable to see the entire movie, and usually having to sit through reloads every 5 -10 minutes. I searched the internet for solutions, moved the router, turned off other devices, changed router transmission channels, bought devices to boost the signal further to the far reaches of the house, called my ISP who told me to upgrade my old modem to Docsis 3.0, had a cable technician come out to the house and try to fix the problem, and other solutions that I've now forgotten. Nothing reliably worked, until I purchased these Powerline Adaptors. They were truly &#34;plug and play&#34;. Following the quickstart instructions I plugged the 1st adaptor into the wall socket nearest the router, then plugged the 2nd adaptor into the powerstrip behind the TV. (They recommend using the wall socket because some powerstrips can block the adaptor signal but I wanted to try it as the wall socket was used by two powerstrips for all the components of my entertainment center.) I connected the ethernet cable into the LAN receptor on the back of my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player. I went back to the 1st adaptor and all 3 lights were on, went then to the 2nd adaptor and all 3 lights were on. This was truly &#34;plug-and-play&#34;.There was no need to press and release any buttons in sequence. I turned on the DVD player and it immediately sensed the internet connection and setup was simple.<br />Last night we streamed a movie in HD without a hitch. I am so thrilled that a solution has finally been found. It couldn't have been easier, and the cost is very reasonable considering the hours of time spent on inadequate solutions. Bravo!!",

The Mac mini is built with HDMI for HDTV & all the apps for the internet. That's what it's made for. So if you want the internet tv shows, movies and your email and regular internet available on your HDTV, this works with awesome results.    If you read reports about problems with the audio getting through the HDMI cable, be aware that your HDTV or sound system may not support the same audio that this Mac mini outputs, especially if these components are older. If you get no audio after set up with an HDMI cable, there are 2 solutions. One is to use the Audio Out jack on the Mac mini and get a cable to bring the audio to your system. The 2nd solution is to open the \\\\\"Applications\\\\\" folder, \\\\\"Utilities\\\\\" folder, then the \\\\\"Audio MIDI Setup\\\\\". Change, lower the parameters here to match what your TV or audio system can use. And also check the \\\\\"Sound\\\\\" set up in the Apple menu \\\\\"System Prefs\\\\\" to make sure that your Mac can see your HDTV at the end of that HDMI cable.    Other than this audio issue that a few are experiencing, (and I struggled with for a day), my new Mac mini is the best for what I needed. And I own (still) 5 old Mac systems that still work. It's the best system made for my money.",

The rubber feet work great in keeping vibration at bay and preventing the satellite speakers from 'walking' around your desk. Whether you decide to put the subwoofer on the ground or on your desk, the sound is still awesome and the subwoofer is attractive enough to be on your desk... not the typical 'black box' many choose to hide in the bottom or back of their desk, which results in muting some sounds. Altec Lansing always does a great job at making great sounding speakers, in attractive, affordable packages that are much more competitively priced than those they compete with in the same class.

I don't like USB devices with removable caps.  It's just a pet peeve because I'm always worried I'll lose it.

And I do agree with another reviewer that it would have been cool if this could double as a USB flash drive.  I'm all for carrying as few things as possible and having this double as a USB drive would have been sweet.  Other than that, it's a bit large for my taste but now I'm just being nit picky.<br /><br />I did appreciate that this came with a USB extension cable.  This is good if you want to use this with a desktop computer but don't want to contort behind it every time you need to plug it in.  It's also good for laptops if you'd rather run the cable behind your laptop and keep the USB adapter out of sight.  As I said, it is a bit large and having a USB extension sticking out the side of my laptop is more appealing to me than this huge thing.<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is an excellent high speed USB network adapter.

I tried to send it to WD to get it fixed, and I was offered a replacement w/ none of my data.  Long story short, I have now lost over 10 years of designs, photos & video projects.  NOTE: Before you get on me about data redundancy, I had all of my data on my computer at work (which i had to move the data to the external hard drive for a Win 7 upgrade) as well as I had it on a hard drive at home (a 500GB WD MyBook hard drive that got accidentally wiped by my xbox 2 weeks prior.)  I do not fault anyone for a nearly \\\\\"perfect storm\\\\\" type of situation.    My only problem is that any other external hard drive that I have owned has been able to be removed from it's enclosure and put into any of the multitude of hard drive enclosures available commercially without missing a beat.  Now I have to sit, scratching my head at how there can be no way to get any of my data back off of this drive while the drive itself is in perfect working order.  In researching online, it seems that this drive's hardware encryption makes it impossible to be read by any other means than the exactly as it is sold so if any vital part of the MyBook fails, the whole of it is lost.  The drive gets 2 stars because when it did work, it worked fine to my standards.  The SmartWare that comes with it didn't do what i needed from a backup solution.  It is unable to be removed from the drive but you could just not use it.  The hardware encryption was what made my data unable to be recovered.  All because of a small, flimsy USB port.",

If you do little else but read novels and the occasional sync for new purchases this is a great device. It has a great form factor, it's light-weight, the battery life is fantastic, the text is clear, and it is quick and easy to get new books.    However, if the content of what you read has diagrams or unusual formatting, the results are not so great. The text pagination can confuse the flow of the text and diagrams are often nowhere near the references (and it's unlikely to be on the screen at the same time). If you compare the kindle to the kindle reader applications you can get for the desktop or iPad, you can see a large gulf between was is and what could be.    A word about support of other formats. PDF is supported, but it's implementation is basic, which means you get to see a full page which is too small to read or very coarse zoom levels that give no flexibility for content. The kindle ticks the box on supporting the feature, but only just in my eyes.    In addition to formatting, the interface is the other let down. In a world of touch screens, the four-way cursor and menu system feels archaic and time consuming.        I have and iPad and a kindle. I use the kindle for reading when traveling (bus, train, plane), and the iPad for all other times. Purely because of the interface.    I guess Amazon isn't too worried about kindle sales, as it has provided lots of reader apps for more capable devices. But if you are thinking about buying a kindle - ask yourself what you want out of it. If it matches the benefits I've listed above, great!

It's pure plug and play, there is no software required. It is pretty much a barebone mouse, but it delivers quite heavily on performance. Used this with CS1.6 CS:S and CoD4, and the results have been amazing. I was doing great with the G500, I'm doing even better with this thing. Also has a really low lift off point, I was pleasantly surprised by that.    Cons: I wouldn't recommend this mouse to anyone who loves a lot of buttons and flashy gimmicks on their mouse. If you are someone who heavily customizes their mouse to meet your demands, this is not the mouse for you. There is no software at ALL, and you cannot customize anything.    There also only 3 DPI settings, 500, 1000 and 2000. I think this is perfect because I have rarely seen anyone who uses more than 1600 DPI. Those 3 DPI settings are all sweet spots that cover almost every gamer on the spectrum. However, if you like customizing your DPI settings, you're out of luck here also.    The DPI button is under the mouse, so you won't accidentally pressed it in-game.      Other Thoughts: Aside from all the cons, the reason I gave this thing 5 stars is because of the performance. This thing is better than any mouse out their right now, optical or laser, in my opinion. The tracking and everything is ultra smooth, and this thing is exceptional on my Zowie SpawN GT-F(another great buy from Zowie). I would recommend this mouse to anyone. You may be turned off by the lack of features, but the performance is too good to ignore.    Zowie EC-1 was recommended to me by another pro CS player.",

I had been swapping drives using a simple SATA-to-USB adapter, but it only works on 2.5-inch drives, not larger 3.5-inch HDDs. Since I have both a laptop and desktop, I have many of both on hand. This one unit accommodates both without hassle. It's simple but attractive and fits well on my desk, and can easily be portable if necessary. Solid as a rock and, barring some unforeseen malfunction in the future, should last a good long time.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to consider adding some USB 3.0 ports to the unit (it has plenty of space for at least 4) to add even greater value and versatility. Also, the power adapter cord could stand to be about a foot longer, but this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />And oh yeah, it supports eSATA connections and comes with really nice cables for both eSATA and USB 3.0.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this to others.

The revolution scrolling feature is really nice for scrolling quickly through pages of long documents, or through thousands of lines of code (if you're a programmer).

The microfiber seems to attract and hold dirt and scuff marks.<br /><br />If you plan on removing your iPad from the case, which I prefer to do at times, you'll have to give it a good fight to remove it from within the case. It's incredibly difficult to do. The iPad is so beautiful and artistically crafted, I don't want to always have it all covered up inside the case, so this became a huge problem.<br /><br />Also, supposedly this case allows you to stand the iPad up in the optional charging cradle/dock that you can buy for the iPad, but the iPad needed about another 1/4 inch to be able to recognize that it was docked. So I was never able to get it to dock with the optional cradle while in this case - despite what they may claim at the Apple store.<br /><br />What I DID like about this was that it could stand up in landscape mode in two different positions and angles while in the case, which was nice. Standing up vertically was a bit wobbly and I didn't feel comfortable leaving it that way. I'm not sure it was advertised to do this, so I didn't ding the review rating for that.<br /><br />My goal now is to find something more durable and protecting of the iPad, which will hold the iPad at different viewing angles, and most importantly, will allow quick removal of the iPad when I want to enjoy it in all it's glory. :)",

It's 360 rotation lets you have it in portrait or landscape view which makes it so nice. When you close the case the iPad goes to sleep. I think that is a real nice feature also.

I had no problem connecting them. I did have a problem with the sound quality. The subwoofer kicks only when the low end of whatever you're listening to is overwhelming - like a big explosion or something like that.

Both computers use DLink DWL-520 Wireless network cards.<br />To solve the problem I updated the firmware to 1.02.  That didn't improve the data rates, but it did make the router's HTML-based menu screens load so slowly that the browser usually timed out.<br />Following industry standards, DLink apparently mans their first echelon phones with technical illiterates who while capable of following a scripted check list, haven't a clue what's causing your problem or how their sequence of steps might might solve it.  For example, to solve the slow menu problem they had me reset the defaults on my browser even though I had no trouble bringing up any other web page I tried.

It has 16 GB of space, which isn't a lot but actually a bit high compared to other tablets I have looked at at the price range. If you are looking for a budget tablet, then this is the one to get.  I also must say I love the Matricom brand.  As stated before this is my second tablet from them.  I also have the G-Box for my television.  One great thing about Matricom is that they stand behind their products.  I had a problem with with the tablet when I first got it.  it had an issue with responding in a certain section of the screen.  I called Matricom and they sent me a new tablet and had me ship the defective one back.  I did not have to pay for this shipping.  Their customer service is A1.  I highly recommend this tablet.",

Especially the D-pad felt loose and rolly which was my biggest fear with getting a game pad for 2D games (even with 3D games the D-pad should not be rolly). I have a Windows 7 machine and the game I wanted to use this for did not recognize it. The instruction manual is in Chinese or something, but I doubt it would have helped even in English. I tried to find some free software to map the buttons to keyboard buttons, but I had to buy some instead. I searched for free software that would do this for quite a while and I am really good at finding truely free software and configuring it, but nothing worked. I ended up using Xpadder to do this which you are supposed to pay for. Setting it up with Xpadder was not as easy as it should have been, but for a geek like myself it was simple enough. Once I actually got it working and used it with my game, the controls are perfect! My concerns about the D-pad were unfounded as it does not control like a loose or rolly D-pad. Each direction is distinct and diagonal is not a separate button but a combination of two. The controller is very responsive. When I mess up, it never seems like the controllers fault. So now that I made it through all that, I am fully satisfied with this game pad. The end result is a 5 star experience while playing games, even though the product as a whole is a 5 star product for how difficult it was to setup. Also, even though I say the playing experience is 5 star, it is not quite as nice as the SNES controller I remember, but that was to be expected. I would have given this five stars if it came with an English instruction manual with directions to do download configuration software from their website and if such software worked on Windows 7 and allowed you to map buttons to the keyboard, ensuring it would work with any game or program.",

            "input": "Let me begin by saying I love the new Kindle Paperwhite. I bought a standard Kindle from a local store, but it was broken out of the box. I was pretty disappointed about that, but I decided I would give Amazon one last try and bought the Paperwhite. No quality control issues out of the box, which is great. The product itself has its ups and downs though. Here is my shortlist of what works and what doesn't (everything else has been covered in-depth by other reviews).<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />The light is the biggest draw for this product. The standard Kindle works well if you are in an extremely well lit room or outside in the sun. If your lighting isn't perfect, you will notice yourself squinting to read. Even with an OttLite next to my bed, I found it difficult to get enough light on the standard Kindle. With the paperwhite, this isn't a problem at all. You can read in any lighting condition. No need to move lamps around or angle your hands so there isn't a shadow. Furthermore, I didn't experience any of the uneven lighting that people complained about, which leads me to believe Amazon fixed the problems with the early units.<br /><br />Also, the lack of 3G really isn't a problem, unless you don't have the foresight to download a book when you are around wifi. With all of the free hotspots these days, paying a huge premium for 3G capability is crazy. And don't think you will use the \\\\\"experimental\\\\\" browser in this thing. Its basically unusable for more than playing around.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) Price... It is really, really hard to justify paying $129 for a Kindle that has so many ads when a Nexus 7 is priced at only $199. Granted, a tablet will never be AS easy to read as an e-reader, but they certainly do a whole lot more. I think Amazon would be better off pricing this around $99 or they risk losing all but the most hardened e-reader fans. People who are just casual readers won't have a problem reading on a tablet, and would probably be happy to pay $80 more for a device that does 1000x more things.<br /><br />2) The Ads... Okay, I understood what I was getting myself into when I bought this, but seriously Amazon, the ads are ridiculous. I don't care about the ads on the screen when I turn the Kindle off, but I really care about how 1/2 of the home screen is taken up by ads, and there is only one row dedicated to the books I bought. When you have a bunch of books, it is a colossal inconvenience to have to keep scrolling through to find what you want. Put a small banner ad at the bottom and give me a few more rows for my own books. It makes no sense to take up an entire row with books you suggest I buy.<br /><br />3) Font... Compare a Paperwhite display to a standard Kindle display and you will see that the Paperwhite's font is much thinner. If they could take the way the text looks on the standard Kindle and combine it with the light of the Paperwhite, it would be amazing.<br /><br />4) No Physical Buttons... big inconvenience for me. I like to get under a blanket on the couch and read. I have to have my hands outside of the blanket to turn the pages, since it won't register unless a finger touches it. (I refuse to buy a Snuggie, FYI). Also, anything dirty on your hands gets on the screen. Lotion? Better not touch the stuff hours before you pick up the Kindle. Unlike a regular tablet with a \\\\\"glass\\\\\" screen, the Kindle has a matte plasticy screen that is nearly impossible to just wipe off.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />If you want the perfect e-reader, this is the ticket. It comes with the amazing Kindle store and Amazon's great customer support. This thing is near perfect, and with a few more little tweaks, they will have it!<br /><br />P.S. Amazon, please, please make a Paperwhite DX!",

It was my first Headset I owned and I was amazed by the sound quality,comfort,and weight(I actually looked at other reviews prior to buying this). Actually without this headset I would have never listened to as much music as I do now. It also made many of my gaming and browsing experiences memorable and enjoyable.  - Comfort: 4/5: I would have these on for hours and after taking them off my ears would be a little sore but it goes away after about 3 minutes. But if you only use them for a couple minutes it is quite comfortable due to the pads.  - Sound Quality 5/5: As I addressed above I was amazed by the sound quality. I could literally hear any sound within 360 degrees of my position when gaming. When listening to music every lyric and instrument is crystal clear. I fell in love with this thing due to the sound quality it produced.  - Mic: 4/5: It's detachable, can be rotated at 360 degrees, and is flexible enough to be bent to a desired position so it is closer to your mouth. Your voice is crystal clear and with Voice FX it can be disguised to your likeness.  - Durability: 1/5: The very thing that brought my piss to a boil. HAVE MERCY. First off the volume and mute control buttons broke this August 2011. I emailed creative about the problem but that they weren't very helpful ,plus it was just a minor setback so I just shrugged it off. Unfortunately the white plastic connecting the left earpiece and the arc also broke, when I was only taking them off. Luckily there's a wire that connects to the right ear piece so I used a rubber band to attach the two phones to my ears.   For those wondering how long I owned this before it broke it was about 1 year and 24 days and it was brand new when I bought this. I think I paid about $160 but I'm just guesstimating. For a headset to cost about $100 and break within a year is just highway robbery. I feel like I paid more for the Software than theHardware. It's in the garbage right now because my chubby bunny just chewed the wire for the audio. Now I gotta find a new headset that won't break on me 9 months after use hopefully with sound quality on par with this product.",

I bought a new router last year and because the modem/cords are in the living room, I got hardly any wifi in my bedroom. When I placed the extender in the bedroom, I could connect easily but the signal was quite low and the internet was pretty slow. However, when I moved the extender closer to the router (about halfway from the living room) the signal was much better and I could easily video chat/stream things without the connection getting interrupted. It isn't foolproof- there are some days that it doesn't pick up the signal so great or days when I have to turn off my wifi and restart it, but it's definitely a solution to wifi range issues in the household. I would definitely recommend it!",

(I've been using Qosmio laptops which are pretty hefty and also macbooks)<br />-USB port that is always powered<br />-Graphics card can play recent games at high frame rates on medium settings and above. (Skyrim can be played on ultra)<br />-Back-lit Keyboard<br />-Nice carbon fiber looking finish.<br />-In general it is a FAST computer<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Mouse pad isn't TERRIBLE, but it takes a lot of getting used to. A mouse is advised and I assume any gamer will use a mouse<br />-The frame is made out of a cheap plastic. Though it doesn't look to bad, I'm worried about it getting damaged. 1 year warranty is nice...<br />-Under average battery life<br />-Being critical, I feel like the frame is a little too large. It's like having an ipad as a screen.<br /><br />Arguable Cons:<br />-The screen is not 1080p but that's what the y510 is really for. A good thing is that you can run some games with a better frame rate.<br />-Windows 8 isn't fantastic for a laptop like this. SOLUTION is to put windows 7 on your hardrive and restore data.<br />Only 1 USB 3.0<br /><br />Benchmarks:<br />League of Legends -Max Settings-  84-120fps<br />Skyrim -Ultra-  34-64 fps<br />Battlefield 3 -High/Ultra-  48-80fps<br />Minecraft -HD Shaders-  29-114fps (average of 53fps)<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />For the price, the laptop is definitely worth it. The laptop has the power of mid-range gaming PC's (arguable) but don't expect it to play the newest games at anything more than high settings unless you modify it. The temperature build up is average and the battery life isn't much of an inconvenience as long as you know when the laptop is about to reach it's limit.<br />1080 would be great but that's what the y510 is for.<br /><br />Hope this helped!",

The feet still work well and keep my laptop inclined and they close when needed, one of the hinges is just a little loose. After six months of heavy use I don't see that it's a huge problem. I tend to snap the feet open at least a dozen times a day. I'm a full time university student, year-round and this case has kept up. I do regularly take it off and clean the aluminum body of my MBP because there will dust or something on it but usually if there's any build up of anything it's going to be on the case itself and not on my laptop so I definitely recommend cleaning the inside and outside of the case regularly. It's great for decorating! I currently have about four decals on this case and I feel so much better about having them on the case than on the laptop.",

The feature set was impressive as was the price.  The model I got was not exactly the same as the one my friend had, but it was the next model up, so in theory it should be better.  Clearly that was not the case.  Out of the box, I tried to attach the stand which was a joke.  It sort of just sat on there, rather than snap into place.  Now I know this may seem petty, but this is an upright router by design, so if even a slight nudge sends this thing slamming into my hard wood entertainment cabinet, then this is not good.  I read about the complexity of the web interface configuration before buying it, but I figured I could handle it if my partner could.  This is not by any means for a novice computer user, but the interface was not bad at all.  I just think that it is packed with a lot of features which overwhelms the average user.  I got everything configured without a hiccup, but wait, just one problem.  It is not running at any better a speed then 56 Mbps, and I have a room with a dead spot in the house.  Now granted this is a two story house, and it used to lose bars in this room on my old Linksys WRT150N, but a complete dead spot?  As if this was not enough, it could not connect to my old HP DV1000 laptop's wireless at all.  I called tech support and after wasting an entire Sunday and I do mean entire, without resolution.  They did explain that I would need a dual band USB wireless adapter to benefit from the 5.0 GHz band, but my Dlink wireless dongle used to get at least a 100 + Mbps on the 2.4 band by the adapter icon on the task bar.  I know that this is not an accurate rate, but it does show that it is generally increased in speed and not capped.  So I conducted speed tests between my old Cisco router setup and the Buffalo, and the old Cisco won out after multiple test form different areas.  Now I'm sureif I continued troubleshooting I could find the answers to make this work well, with or without the help of tech support, but I felt it prudent that I should not have to.  A wireless device should not be this complicated to get these most basic of functions working.  My WRT150N did just as good and in some instances better than this one.  I still wanted better coverage in that one room so I later purchased another Cisco device that has met all my expectations thus far and at a third less in price.  The difference gave me the money to buy the dual band USB wireless dongle, to take full benefit of the dual band.  By: King's iRate",

These speakers sound great for their price. I am actually surprised by how the low tones sound. (This is actually the reason I'm grading them: to offset those bad reviews.)<br /><br />One thing I was looking for was for &#34;heavy enough&#34; speakers so that they would stay in place. I previously had a couple of Logitech S120 and got rid of them precisely because of this: the speakers were too light, and the cables too thick: so any unintentional movement in the cable would cause the speakers to move.",

The picture quality of the monitor is great, no dead pixels (yet).   The TV aspect works great as well. The tuner picks up over the air HD channels very well and if you have cable, includes the HD channels as well. My only complaint is that it seems to get stuck on a channel (only happens on the first programmed channel) and you basically have to key in the next one to move up. The 'touch of color' is barely noticeable so if you can save money by buying the standard black one, do so.

On top of that, you'll want to pretty much max out your game's VOIP settings.<br /><br />ON TO THE REVIEW:<br /><br />Since picking up this clever microphone I have noticed that people in online games can understand me much better. In games where communication is vital to success this will give you a winning edge. In games that promote socializing, you will find that your friends will hear every nuance of your voice as if you were in the room with them more or less. Fifteen dollars is a freaking steal. The mic stand design of this mic makes it very unobtrusive and intuitive. If someone else is next to you while you're gaming, they can chime into the mic without leaning awkwardly close to your face. You also don't have to wear a geeky headset and you may even feel like a comedian or something talking into this little gizmo XD.",

The buttons click with ease and are not noisy.  This gives them a really smooth and expensive feel to button clicking, making overall mouse usage a pleasure.  The additional grips and weights are a nice touch for those who want the most from their mouse but what I've noticed and liked most is the shape and low profile of the mouse.  At first this was a bit awkward since I was used to bigger full sized mice with high arches to support the palm of my hand.  However, those mice made my hands sweat all the time and the heat and moisture always left me less than comfortable.  With this mouse, my palm does not touch the mouse but rather hovers over it.  This was odd at first but after getting used to it I prefer it.  Now my hands never sweat and it actually takes less effort to move the mouse.  There are also some other outstanding features to the mouse, notably the microgear hyper scrolling feature that I cannot live without now.  All in all, highly recommended.",

(I'm a minimalist.) Yes, it is quite expensive, but I got it for a great deal with an Amazon Local offer, so that helped. (If you don't get these deal offers already, I highly recommend them. You can also buy them through third-party vendors, right here on this product page; there's really no need to pay full price for one of these.)<br /><br />I really like this cover on every level except one -- it puts your Kindle to sleep, but does not seem to allow you to actually turn the Kindle off. Evidently Amazon assumes that no one ever actually wants to turn their Kindle OFF. But with my busy schedule, I read for fun in starts and spurts, and, sadly, can go weeks without opening my Kindle. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn the Kindle off or keep it turned off with the cover. I power down with the button, and when I open the cover later, I can see the sleep screen and/or my Kindle springs to life as if it's been only asleep (not off, no startup screen), and, if weeks have passed, my battery life has been eaten down to a nub. The last time this happened, I \\\\\"powered down\\\\\" (or put it asleep) with half of the battery life, and when I opened it again, the battery was almost completely drained. (And this was in airplane mode; I keep my Kindle in airplane mode pretty much all the time, except when I'm downloading books or backing up to the Cloud.) It doesn't matter if I power down with the cover open or closed. With it open, I can see that it's actually powering down, but it doesn't matter. It wakes up again later as if it's only been asleep. If someone knows of a way to fix or work around this problem, please respond. It's a bit frustrating. Otherwise, I really love the cover and the Kindle that fits in it.",

However, this means you can no longer tap on a part of the page where you are unclear what was going on and hear the content at that point. There is also no feature in the app that allows you to select a part of the page you would like to listen to, only a standard scroll bar like you would find in an mp3 player.  The app has bugs and limited functionality. For instance, the app froze the very first time I tried to record audio. The only way to review notes with audio is to watch them like videos at standard speed --- no speed adjustment! There is no reason to ever look at the notebook again because you can't access the audio from the notebook.  All that I want from Livescribe is a pen that is smaller and more classic in appearance. If they can do that, I will happily upgrade.  As far as this product, you would be better off using that fancy iPhone to record audio while you write with pen and paper, then scan the your notes at the end with the phone.  Why the three stars? It's completely unreasonable to give this product fewer than three stars.

My husband has already claimed it.  He loves that now he can play his games on our tv and not just the laptop with a wired mouse.  It has a nice resolution.  So nice not to have to install drivers before using.  Has a nice off/on switch to save the battery life too.  My husband can't wait to play his games.  Highly recommend.

I watch TV in 2 ways: 1.via the monitor from a high definition TV tuner USB stick 330 (with antenna) I bought from Kworld:    http://www.amazon.com/Kworld-ATSC%252fNTSC-Hybrid-HDTV-Tuner/dp/B000OXJK4K/ref=cm_cr-mr-title     2. via the TV from the super cheap budget TV antenna I bought, which gives me 74 free over the air digital channels, many of which are in 1080i format:    [...]    There is a source button on the remote which allows one to switch from monitor to TV and back to monitor instantly.     Some colors fade on the monitor when you view it from the side, so it's best to sit in front of the monitor.     For this price, this monitor/tv is an absolute bargain.",

The finish is almost leathery -- quite cool.<br /><br />A prior reviewer stated problems with both the thickness and the cut of the product- #1 - The description clearly describes it as a decal (I'm not sure about others, but I knew what this meant) #2 - The description also informs the purchaser that while it does fit 15.6 laptops, it may need to be trimmed to fit -- Not all laptops are made the same, and although many do not have straight corners, some do. It would actually be improper if the product were NOT cut to the larger specifications... This allows the buyer to simply take the step of using scissors, prior to peeling the decal off of the base, to downsize the product.<br /><br />IF you find yourself unhappy with the size/shape, as stated above, I had no problem peeling/reapplying the product more than once, and if you still have problems, the customer service left me quite happy, so I'm sure they'd be willing to help.<br /><br />I now have a beauty of a laptop case, and would gladly order one again.",

I have used this keyboard and mouse for several months (nearly a year).  The major complaint is this keyboard often misses keystrokes during normal typing.  You will type a word completely and correctly and occasionally a letter will be missing.  I write invoices about 5 to10 times a day and this occurs in nearly every invoice.  If this keyboard were a few years old then I would understand but it's less than a year old. I have been dealing with this since about the 2nd month of use.  I have tried changing batteries, relocating the USB dongle to different ports on my laptop/docking station (even moved offices but not for this reason).  Nothing improves performance.  Now I'm not saying this is junk.  On the contrary....for light to moderate use this keyboard is awesome.  I would highly recommend this for travel as the size is perfect.  As for using in an office for daily use.....well it just barely misses the mark.  I wanted to keep my desk free of clutter, looks like I'll be searching or a different keyboard at some point in the future.  I'll keep using this for now.     ORIGINAL REVIEW  -  The keyboard is very quiet as described.  The spacing of the keys is similar to a standard keyboard while excess plastic and trim has been removed.  Type just as you do on a standard keyboard without missing keys. The mouse is very small but perfect for travel.  The mouse covers a little less space than a credit card making it ideal for cramped locations.  They keyboard and mouse use two AAA batteries.  The keyboard is raised by the battery compartment providing a comfortable working angle.  Both items are very slim and easily stowed for travel.  When not in use, the USB wireless receiver can be stored in the battery compartment of the mouse (and arrives this way when purchased).  This review is to help those who are lookingat this product for its size.  This product has not been used extensively enough to offer any advice on reliability.  Product operating on a laptop using Windows 8.1.",

Now I no longer need to pack two or three heavy books in my suitcase for a two week trip. Also, it is easier to read than hardcopy -- adequate lighting is no longer an issue and I honestly believe I experience less eye strain using the Kindle.

This thing is amazing. Gorgeous, sleek, fast, and did I say gorgeous?  I bought the 27\\\\\" 2.9GHz for $200 less because it was the model Amazon had in stock. I was a little afraid it would not be powerful enough for my needs, but it turns out it exceeds them.  I am using it for amateur photography needs, and just basic home use and internet use.  I bought an external \\\\\"Apple SuperDrive\\\\\" at $75,  a pair of 8GB memory cards \\\\\"Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800) CL11 SODIMM 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V Memory Modules For Mac CT2C8G3S160BM\\\\\" at $85, and a \\\\\"Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac\\\\\" to back up my photos at $137.  I also bought the $169 Apple warranty. Though I have been told Macs have a rep for not going bad, if they do, an Apple Tech told me the cheapest repair is $800.  So, I got the warranty for peace of mind.  Anyway, back on the performance of this Mac....it has more than exceeded my expectations...I am glad I saved $200 and got the 2.9 since that money helped pay for the other items.<br /><br />Note that some bad reviews were over this super thin model not having a built in DVD/CD drive.  What is the big deal?  You can live without one, but if you do want it, just buy the Apple Super Drive for $75; it plugs into the back of the iMac via USB and is very thin and small.  It sits on the iMac stand and is the same color as the stand, so just blends right in. Or if you prefer a blu-ray, there a black Samsung Bluray read/write external drive.  So, adding an external player is NOT an issue.  Actually, I think it is an advantage to have it as a peripheral, since dying DVD/CD drives have been an annoying problem in the past with PCs.  With it being an inexpensive peripheral on this iMac, I can simply buy another down the road should it go out.<br /><br />Note also that the1TB internal Hard Drive and 8GB of memory should be PLENTY for almost all needs and I found the standard configuration to be very fast and efficient as shipped.  I bought the external drive as added protection for my photos, and the extra memory because I use Photoshop and work with a lot of memory-sapping RAW images.  But unless you are into photography or heavy graphics, I do not think these additions are necessary at all...and actually a waste of money.<br /><br />You could just buy this iMac without warranty, external DVD drive, extra memory, external Hard Drive and save yourself almost $500.  I guarantee you will be very happy with this awesome machine as shipped and you probably will not have need of the warranty in the first 3 years anyway.  These tweeks depend on your point of view and your personal needs.<br /><br />Overall, I could not be happier with this iMac and highly recommend it.  The display is stunning and the machine is powerful and glitch free.<br /><br />P.S.<br />I was hesitant to purchase this from Amazon vs directly from Apple (not sure why...I guess because Apple has traditionally been the exclusive seller of their products)...but had no problems or issues at all in doing so.  It shipped via UPS with signature required....arrived in two days packed in a very heavy and form-fitting outer box. It's delivery was no different from my experience buying online from Apple, with the exception that Apple usually uses FedEx.  Of course, if you buy from Apple, you can configure your IMac a little bit...but adding memory from Apple is very expensive (even if you buy from Apple you should buy your memory separately and install yourself.  It is very easy to do). And buying a larger internal HD is not necessary either if you get an external.  The external is better anyway in that you can use Time Machine to backup your computer in case a calamity hit your desktop.",

That's fine for most people. But if your computer is on the floor it may be too short. I've ordered the [[ASIN:B003Z4G3I6 Plugable 7 Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub with 3A Power Adapter]]. Trust me, you'll want a powered USB hub later anyway for other game controlers/panels.<br /><br />2) I've read complaints about the potentiometers (electrical thingies attached to the levers inside the box) going bad. This is not uncommon with potentiometers and can easily be fixed by using \\\\\"contact cleaner\\\\\" sold in any electronics store, even Radio Sh--k. I took the bottom off (watch where the screws come from, as there are 6 screws in 3 different sizes.

The side buttons are small, cramped, and placed too far towards the back of the mouse to be easily used without further forcing your hand down and off the mouse.    Honestly I hate it.

            "input": "I also have the previous version [[ASIN:B007PJ4Q4A Logitech Anywhere Mouse MX]]. The old MX is still a great mouse, especially at the reduced price it's selling for now. It does have a few shortcomings though; for instance: I'm loathed to buy AA and AAA batteries for anything in my house anymore (I don't understand why everything isn't USB rechargeable) and it only works with Logitech's Unifying dongle. So when I upgraded laptops to one who's manufacturer thought a single USB port is plenty (Ahem, Microsoft) a few months ago, I purchased the [[ASIN:B00DR8LA6U Logitech Ultrathin Touch Mouse T630]] to keep in my laptop bag. The advantages were two-fold; first the T630's Bluetooth pairing meant I didn't have to dedicate my only USB port to a mouse full-time, and secondly, it was USB rechargeable, so I knew if it was ever out of power I could just charge it, rather than having to go on a quest for more AA batteries. This didn't work out quite as well in practice though. While super-portable, isn't exactly comfortable to use for hours at a time, and it was a bit tricky to get the gestures to work on a surface that also moves around. Also, it only paired over Bluetooth; it didn't work with Logitech's Unifying receivers at all, so that's something to keep in mind. Finally, the USB charging port is on the bottom, so it's impossible to use while charging. It only takes 10 or 15 minutes to get a day's use out of it, but this was still annoying.<br /><br />The MX Anywhere 2 is the best of both worlds, plus some. To start with, it's the same size, shape, and feel as the old MX, with the exception of the rubber grip strips on the sides. The old MX has small uniform dimpling, while the MX 2 has angled textures which I like both the look and feel of much better. Some may find it on the small side for a primary mouse, but I find it quite comfortable in both the right and left hand (important for a lefty) for all day use, and it's still small enough to throw in the laptop bag without adding too much bulk. I certainly notice the bulged in the bag now, unlike the super-slim T630, but it's definitely a trade-off worth making for the added comfort and functionality. Secondly, the MX 2 is USB rechargeable, with the port right in the front so it can easily be used while charging. This means I can just leave it plugged in and use it all day at my desk, then take it with me on the go, and it's always topped up and ready, or if I need to I can charge it from my laptop without interrupting my work. Finally, the MX 2 pairs with up to 3 separate devices in any mix of Bluetooth or Unifying dongle, and switch between them with the push of a button. This is fantastic for laptops and tablets which often include only a paucity of USB ports these days, as well as Android devices (though apple still doesn't have basic cursor support for ios; tisk, tisk...).<br /><br />The only negative I've found in the MX 2 is a pet peeve of mine. Included in the package is a Unifying dongle, which is great. In the old MX, there was a slot in the battery compartment where you could store the dongle when not in use so it doesn't get lost. The MX 2 doesn't have a removable  battery, so there's no battery compartment, and Logitech didn't think to put a slot somewhere else to store the dongle. That's it, that's the only thing I can find that I don't like about this mouse; you have to keep track of that little Unifying dongle on your own.<br /><br />I highly recommend this mouse to anyone, though the old MX is still a worthy option for about half the price. ..If buying AA batteries once in a while doesn't offend you, and you have a USB port to spare, or are already using a Unifying receiver for other peripherals.t adding too much bulk.

Dark Souls 2, Dishonored, Borderlands 2, and Hitman give me a consistent 60 fps across the board. The 4k image is so life-like that the picture on this looks three dimensional. If you are on the fence as to whether or not this monitor is worth it, I recommend you go ahead and buy one. I doubt you'll regret it.",

The high capacity does require a compatible BIOS or UEFI (that's the modern replacement for BIOS), but once you have the mobo support, Windows 8 makes it easy to install a 4TB drive, with just a quick trip to the Drive Management utility.<br /><br />Compared to large-capacity Seagate drives I've used, this WD is quiet.  Speed-wise, it certainly feels like a champion, helped in part by its 64MB cache.  Compared to a previous WD internal drive I used and reviewed, waking up from sleep is speedy on this drive.  Really, I have nothing negative to say about this drive's performance.<br /><br />Of course, beyond performance one's main concern is reliability, or how long a drive will last.  I've owned over a dozen WD drives, internal or external, and none of them has ever failed, going back as early as circa 1997, maybe even earlier (before 1997, when I built my first system from scratch, I had never paid attention to drive makes).  I hope this will last a long time, too, especially since I use it in an informal server environment.",

There are plenty of 15.6\\\\\" or 17\\\\\" screen systems out there that are able to pack the highest performing components inside, but leave your shoulder/back aching. On the other side of the spectrum, there are a number of sleek, ultra book class notebooks that are easy to carry, but leave you wanting more performance. I needed a high performance notebook that allows me to multi-task and game a bit while away from home. The MSI GE40 is a nice compromise between the two categories with a few caveats.<br /><br />Design:<br />Weighing in at 4.4ish pounds, the GE40 is quite light for what it packs inside. The palm rest and lid are a brushed aluminum. The lid has eye-catching red LEDs in the form of \\\\\"dragon eyes\\\\\". The rest of the body is comprised of your standard glossy plastic that attracts finger prints, but isn't handled all that often in everyday use. There is more flex in the palm rest and keyboard than a full aluminum chassis, but it doesn't scream poor quality.<br /><br />Screen:<br />My main issue with the GE40 is the quality of the screen. While it does feature a high 1600x900 resolution for a 14\\\\\" screen, it is an average TN panel with OK viewing angles. This evaluation is quite subjective although I personally think the vertical viewing angles are poor. You will need to view the screen dead on or the image will be washed out. This left me a little frustrated trying to watch netflix on my bed.<br /><br />Performance:<br />With a high wattage Intel Haswell Quad-core 4th generation processor, it chews through everything quite quickly. The lower wattage CPUs in ultrabooks are primarily designed for battery longevity and much lower thermals with decent performance. The difference between Apple's latest generation Macbook air with it's 15W Dual-Core CPU and the GE40 is very noticeable in the programs that I use (namely Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, transcode applications). The dynamic overclocking of the CPU also allows lightly threaded applications to take advantage of higher clock speeds whilst putting the unused cores to sleep.<br /><br />The graphics duties are shared between the integrated intel HD4600 and a dedicated NVIDIA GTX 760M. The switching is handled with NVIDIA's optimus tech. The integrated graphics are powerful enough to handle the Windows GUI acceleration, Flash, and movie playback to conserve power and reduce heat generation. The GTX 760M kicks in when you launch a full screen 3D application, allowing you to take advantage of a large performance increase. The GTX 760M did a great job of providing acceptable frame rates at the native resolution in the games I play. For specific numbers, look up the GTX 760M on Notebookcheck.com<br /><br />This version of the GE40 has a 128GB solid state drive and a 750GB hard disk drive (occupying the bay where the DVD-ROM is on the cheaper version). Out of the box this notebook is much faster, but you should ask yourself if that is enough room for your OS and programs. Personally, I think a 256GB SSD is the minimum size, but you can always put your steam folder and larger games on the mechanical drive if you're willing to deal with longer load times.<br /><br />While the GE40 has 8GB of DDR3-Low Voltage memory installed, it is a single DIMM. This is both a plus and minus. With a single DIMM, you drop your effective bandwidth to 10GB/ps for the CPU and integrated GPU. You'll be hard pressed to see a noticeable drop in performance, but this is supposed to be a high end system. On the other hand, if you were planning to go to a total of 16GB of RAM, you won't have to buy x2 8GB DIMMs. Just grab 1 8GB DIMM and you'll get your dual channel memory performance.<br /><br />Preinstalled Software:<br />Windows 8: You either love it or hate it. I personally like Microsoft's new OS due to the faster performance and support for new hardware technologies. I'm not a fan of the Start Screen, but that's easily remedied with a third party start menu replacement. The product key for Windows is integrated into the UEFI BIOS of the system so you won't need to enter a key during Windows setup. Just activate once you've reinstalled the OS.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Norton and other trialware is preinstalled. You'll be greeted with a number of desktop cluttering icons and background services taking up system resources. It isn't nearly as bad as some, but again, this is a gaming system that shouldn't have junk preinstalled to begin with.<br /><br />I personally reinstalled Windows 8 after installing an extra 8GB DIMM. Be prepared to download the wireless LAN drivers beforehand as Windows 8 doesn't come with them out of the box. There are also a plethora of other drivers that need to be installed to restore full functionality (Bluetooth, WLAN switch, ETC).<br /><br />Noise/Heat:<br />In normal operation, the notebook is a bit warm to the touch and the fan constantly runs at a slight hum. The fan is audible, but not overtly or annoyingly so. When gaming, the notebook does get hot. It's not unbearable, but it isn't super comfortable either. The fan kicks it into high gear and is very noisy. I was able to hear it every between explosions in game with my headphones on. Both the heat and noise levels are to be expected, especially with the amount of performance packed into such a small chassis.<br /><br />Overall evaluation:<br />The MSI GE40 is a great notebook that fills my needs well. The balance of portability and performance allows me to finish my work quickly to get a little bit of play in. If you can cram your programs and games onto a 128GB SSD, you'll find more value in the upgraded version of the GE40. Otherwise both notebooks can stand to have an additional 8GB of memory and a clean install of Windows to maximize its performance and your enjoyment.<br /><br />Update 7/10/2013:<br />I was curious if I could get the thermals down a bit, so I opened up my notebook again to see what kind of job MSI did with the thermal paste. As I suspected, they put way too much on which was hindering the heat transfer from the CPU and dedicated GPU to the heatpipe assembly.<br /><br />Dis-assembly was not that difficult; 8 philips screws and the fan and heatpipe was easily removed. I cleaned up the factory paste and wiped the CPU/GPU and heatpipe with some isotropic alcohol. I then applied a thin layer of artic silver 5 and put it all back together. Subjectively, the notebook runs cooler. The fan spins slower at idle and comes back down from 100% quicker after playing a game. The palm rest and WASD keys were also a bit cooler. I didn't record before and after temperatures, but there are a couple youtube videos detailing this modification and the tangible results.<br /><br />If you are comfortable performing this procedure, I wholeheartedly recommend doing it. Your left palm and wrist will thank you.edied with a third party start menu replacement.

The power button can also be a pain.  Every once in a while my hand will come across it and I'll be prompted to turn off my Fire.  Some people say you can just hold it in landscape mode or flip it over.  This works most of the time but some apps are locked on portrait mode with the power button at the bottom.

I first set it up with a single [[ASIN:B008JJLXO6 WD Red 1 TB NAS Hard Drive: 3.5 Inch, SATA III, 64 MB Cache - WD10EFRX]], and created a ReadyCLOUD account. That was simple and straightforward, and allows the user an interface to access the ReadyNAS from virtually anywhere. I also installed the free ReadyCLOUD app on my android (HTC One (M8)), and then mapped a couple of network drives to locations on the ReadyNAS. So far so good.<br /><br />I started by transferring a couple of files over by dragging and dropping, and found the drag/drop feature through the interface tends to freeze fairly often, particularly with large files. With patience, the system would unfreeze and continue as normal, but I found that somewhat annoying. However, I did not experience system freezes when drag/dropping between a local and the network drive I mapped to the NAS. Speed was unremarkable, with a read/write speed of about 11.5MB/s. However, this could have been bottlenecked by my own system/router.<br /><br />Next, I plugged in two more 1TB WD Red drives, and let X-RAID take over to create a RAID5 configuration. The rebuild took about 12 hours, and I was back in business. This time, I had a read speed of 66MB/s, with a write speed of 43MB/s measured with CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3.<br /><br />I set up Genie Timeline to use a networked location on the NAS for its new backup location, and kicked off my backup. While that was running, I installed PLEX through the Apps tab on the NAS interface, and transferred over a few movies, not expecting much. However, found I could stream MP4 movies with ease. It was literally as simple as turning on my circa 2011 Panasonic Viera TV, navigating to the DLNA app, then selecting the PLEX server I had installed on the NAS and choosing a movie to watch. Movies stream instantly, and seem to be more responsive than even Netflix. I can stream movies to my phone as well through the ReadyCLOUD android app, but cannot stream in a web browser on my laptop as HTML5 is not supported.<br /><br />While my original intent was to use this exclusively as a backup device, I'm sufficiently impressed that I've renewed my project of ripping DVDs and Blu Rays. While the ReadyNAS 104 cannot serve as an end-all media server - it's well-documented that you won't be happily transcoding anything with an ARM-powered NAS device - it works well enough for streaming media, and excels as a storage or backup device.<br /><br />At the ~$250 price point, you won't do much better.",

I love the feel of the Magic Mouse, but its erratic jumping around the screen in certain programs (anything from Adobe and Microsoft) drives me crazy. The M510 is a lot fatter, but not uncomfortable. Out of the box it worked pretty good with Mountain Lion. I'd say it was almost as accurate as the Magic Mouse, but not quite, except when it came to scrolling. That's where the M510 shines. Since Apple removed scroll bar arrows, it's really difficult to scroll through lists, especially Adobe's little palettes in Photoshop CS6. But the ratcheted scroll wheel lets you easily move from one Pantone color to the next with no problem. And the scroll wheel rocks right and left for sideways scrolling of big images, almost like the Magic Mouse. Sadly, the accuracy of the mouse declined after about a week. Using a mousepad helped a little, but then the M510 started clicking on its own, making dragging and dropping files impossible. Finally, I installed the Logitech driver, but it doesn't work with Mountain Lion so I could never try out the side buttons.<br /><br />PROS: Comfortable, very accurate track wheel, batteries supposedly last a long time (I couldn't test this)<br /><br />CONS: Clicker went nuts after only a week, accuracy is iffy, wireless dongle hogs a USB port (Apple's Bluetooth is built in), hard-to-open molded plastic packaging, old school design could go on a diet, driver doesn't work with Mountain Lion",

I'm sure this is not a good sign for long term reliability. Bottom line: I do not recommend this product at all - anyone found a better 1.5TB or larger drive at similar price please let us know.

And the 8 GB capacity on this guy makes it very useful for a lot of large file backups or USB storage and transfer.  There are a few things to keep in mind but overall this is a solid product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Kingston brand is well deserved<br />+ Reliable performance<br />+ Nice capacity of 8 GB has you future proofed as smaller USB drives start to disappear<br />+ Durable body and NAND memory stands up to a lot of abuse<br />+ Compatible with old and new Mac and PC Operating Systems (XP, Vista, OS X)<br />+ Very light<br />+ Rear bar to connect a lanyard or keychain<br />+ USB 2.0 connection is backwards compatible for older computers<br />+ Very quickly mounts and stops<br />+ Less scum-ware and needless apps than some other drives<br />+ Easy to format and enable encryption to protect your data<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cap comes off easily and can be lost; inferior to retractable designs<br />- Lanyard or extender accessories not included<br />- Doesn't have the good looks of some drives like the Sandisk Cruzer Micro<br />- Still somewhat slow speed in copying large files, limited by USB transfer rate<br />- Same old body is larger than it has to be<br />- Keychain / lanyard attachment bar is too easily broken<br />- Pricing here doesn't change to reflect when this item goes on sale elsewhere<br /><br />This is the same design that Kingston has used for these Data Traveler USB drives since the 1 GB I got quite a while ago.<br /><br />Transfer speeds are comparable to other drives, but still slower than one would like.  Load ups are fast and stops are only a little slower.<br /><br />In order to enable encryption, there are a few ways but the best may be to use another tool to encrypt the drive after re-formatting it.  This way you can test the drive as well as use the encryption you prefer.<br /><br />The main real competition is from Sandisk, whose Cruzer Micro has a tab to retract the USB connector [[ASIN:B000UZN2ZK SanDisk 8 GB Cruzer Micro USB 2.0 Drive with U3 SDCZ6-8192-A11 (retail packaging)]].  That way there's no risk of losing the cap, but there is more chance of getting dust in it.  It is more expensive though.<br /><br />Kingston produces some retractable ones as well.<br />[[ASIN:B000TZ5WSG Kingston DataTraveler 100 - USB flash drive - 8 GB - Hi-Speed USB - black]]<br />[[ASIN:B000TXEE14 Kingston DT100/8GB Data Traveler 100 8 GB USB 2.0 Drive]]<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This is a nice capacity in a small USB drive.

            "input": "I've been using this Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard & Mouse for several months now.  I have it connected to my laptop when I'm using it at home.  When the mouse works, it's very good.  However, the Bluetooth connection is not consistent, and I constantly need to reconnect the mouse by turning it off and on.  This happens at least once a day, sometimes more frequently, and it usually happens while I'm moving the mouse pointer.  Once disconnected, the mouse will reconnect if I turn the mouse's power switch off and then on again.  However, this is a hassle, and it takes 5-10 seconds for the mouse to be recognized again.<br /><br />Before using this Logitech mouse, I've been using a Dell Bluetooth Mouse.  That mouse didn't have this frequent disconnect problem, and usually lasted several weeks or more between disconnections.  I've also had a Lenovo Bluetooth mouse, which disconnected more frequently than the Dell one, but still much less than this Logitech one.  In my experience (and most other Bluetooth users' too), Bluetooth mice have a tendency to disconnect, so I don't think Logitech is completely to blame.  However, disconnecting on a daily basis (often more than once per day) is unacceptable, especially when other mice can work much better on the same laptop.<br /><br />Other than the disconnect issue, the mouse is well built, feels comfortable, and the extra buttons work well.  The buttons are customizable, but with some limitations (Logitech's SetPoint software gives you a limited list of functions to choose from).  The Hyperscroll function works well too, but may take a bit of getting used to.  The laser sensor works well on most surfaces (including my desk where my optical mouse didn't work too well).  The battery lasts about 2-3 weeks for me, which is adequate, but I would probably prefer user replaceable batteries instead, so I could get longer battery life, and also not have to deal with the extra charger on my desk.<br /><br />The keyboard does not have the same issue as the mouse, and I haven't experienced any disconnections from the keyboard yet.  The keyboard does get a bit laggy when the mouse spontaneously disconnects, but it is resolved when the mouse has been reset.  Also, it takes a couple seconds for the keyboard to connect when turning on the laptop.  When it gets to the Windows login screen, I can type my password and press enter, but it will take a couple seconds for it to register on the screen (not a big deal though, and I'm sure it's the same for all BT keyboards).  The keyboard itself is very easy to type on, and the keys sound like they are slightly dampened, so it isn't very loud.  I wouldn't say it's very quiet either, but at least it doesn't make annoying loud clacking sounds.  There are many function keys that can be customized, and the LCD calculator function is quite convenient too (you can have the calculator button go to Windows Calculator instead if you don't like the LCD calculator).  The media keys also work well.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, so I can't comment on the battery life.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product from Logitech, and since there aren't that many choices for Bluetooth keyboards & mice out there, I decided to keep this set even with the mouse connectivity issues.  Some users may not experience the same disconnect issues, and for those users, I'd give the set 5 stars.  However, for those that have the disconnect issues, the product is probably only worth 1-2 stars.  That is why I gave it an average 3 star rating.  If you want a good Bluetooth keyboard & mouse set, and are willing to take a chance with the connection problems, then order this product.  Amazon is very good with returns anyway, so if you find that the mouse doesn't work well with your computer, you could always return the product.<br /><br />KEYBOARD:<br />-Comfort 8/10<br />-Functions 9/10<br />-Keys Quietness 4/10 (0 being makes no sound, and 10 being unbearably loud)<br />-Connectivity 9/10<br />-Battery Life 8/10 (estimated)<br /><br />MOUSE:<br />-Comfort 8/10<br />-Functions 7/10<br />-Connectivity 1/10<br />-Battery Life 5/10",

I would buy it again. It has plenty of internal memory and I like the fact that you can add extra to it. I have so many books on mine that i had to expand more memory but you can cram a lot on 8 gigs in the internal memory. The only major complaint that I have is that you cannot get an exact fit case. All the universal cases block out the back camera making it useless. I don't use the camera so I am not to worried about it but Aluratek needed to provide a custom case.

A newer model (the N810) came out so I compared the newer and the older models and the older one won hands down.  Like the Iphone and Ipod touch, this offers a full internet browsing experience not just mobile sights and the clarity of the screen is stunning.  Also it is an internet radio with presets from all over the world so you can use it as a radio.  Also, hidden inside the radio but not mentioned in any Nokia Literature, the N800 has a hidden FM radio receiver (the N810 does not have this).  With a few commands you can activate it and you use the earphones as antenna - but you can listen thru the speakers. You can also watch videos on You Tube with no problems at all.  You can download the latest software that comes with the N810 for free from Nokia.   Speaking of downloads, ACCESS has made Garnet (Palm OS) available free for download so you can download Palm programs to the machine.  This is a Linux machine but don't let that put you off.  I had never used one and have found it easy.  Plus there are lots of free software like FBRreader available which lets you make the N800 a digital books reader.  They've also just released a program for free which completely simulates a Star Trek PADD from the Next Generation.  Whew!  Is that enough for you?  Oh did I mention that all this is a little over $200 - half of what you pay for an Ipod Touch and you get so much more.  PS there are 2 memory chip slots so you can put in as much as 32 gig on cards purchased separately.  The N810 only has one micro memory card chip slot.  Oh and the battery is easly changed - it is a Nokia battery available at any cellphone supply store unlike Apple where you have to send in the whole unit when the battery runs out.  All in all, this is a winner you will not regret.",

Adobe Gamma got me whole lot closer to my ideal of a perfect color match than my factory default unadjusted monitor, but it was still off... the colors were a little too warm and the gamma a bit too high.  Then I decided to order a hardware calibration tool.  Enter the Spyder2Express.  This thing is amazing!  It was very easy to install and set up.

Bottom line, this is a well-made product that will be up to the personal preferences of the user.     It is fantastic at reducing fingerprints. When the screen is off they are barely perceptible. It isn't hard to install, just PREP the area - canned air, wash hands (I wore disposable surgical gloves), go slow - and you'll be fine.    The only reason I removed my screen after two weeks was that I could tell there was a significant loss of clarity when viewing pages or using the Kindle app. At first I tried to ignore it, but after a family member visited and I used theirs, sans screen, I felt like I was viewing a HiDef BluRay DVD after watching an over-the-air lo-res cable feed.     The product is otherwise built really well, and I stored it in a ziploc in case I ever sell it, but having lived without it for a week-plus now, I don't miss it at all.

The black adjustment buttons on a black frame can be difficult to distinguish, and I would prefer the buttons were of a contrasting color such as silver or chrome.<br /><br />There is no vertical (height) adjustment or the capacity to swivel right/left with this monitor, but it does have a forward/back tilt mechanism.<br /><br />It is overly easy to assemble (three pieces not including display or cords) and no tools are required, with fairly good cord managment to the rear.",

I would not have gotten this much pleasure from the GTablet if I had not installed a third party ROM to replace the stock ROM that comes with the GTablet.  I went through Tnt Lite and Vegan which are Android 2.2 and give you full access to the Android market.  Now I am using Vegan Gingerbread (Android 2.3) and am looking forward to upgrading to Honeycomb (Android 3.x) in the next few weeks.      The viewing angle is indeed not great.  But only when watching videos.  For anything else, it is, at best, a nuisance, hardly noticeable.  But when streaming a video or movie, I notice it.  That said, I watch a lot of streamed videos.  For me it is an irritant, not a deal breaker.    Wifi is more than adequate.  I am frequently at least 50 feet from my wifi router. It is located in the basement. Last night I watched three episodes of a TV show with no problems.      The battery is amazing.  Eight to ten hours.    The Acer Aconia and the Asus Transformer are attractive, but reading their reviews, they also have issues you have to learn to live with.  Plus they are more expensive.  I got two GTablets for the price of one Xoom. The Acer cost 50% more, but I don't think I'd get 50% more value. I don't need a back facing camera.  An HDMI port would be nice, but I have only used the one on my laptop twice over a year.  I've got the same processor as the Asus, Acer, and Xoom.  I'll be gettingAdroid 3 soon.     If you absolutely have to buy a Tablet today, the Gtab is an excellent choice.  If I wanted to spend $450 to $600 dollars, I'd wait to see what comes out during the Christmas season.      Support from Viewsonic is worthless.  But the support from the community of Gtab owners and programmers is priceless.  People get a lot of problems solved by knowledgeable community members on sites such as XDA developers, and slatedroid. I have directly benefited from this community when I ran into problems installing a new ROM. Of course not every problem gets solved.  But I think the odds are in the Gtablet owner's favor.     The bottom line is that you must decide what you are comfortable with, how much you are willing to pay, and how long you are willing to wait.      I understand the features and advantages of the newer tablets on the market today.  But I don't seem them as a superior value to what I've got.  I know that the Gtablet will serve me very well for a long time.  I reserve the right to change my mind 6 months from now.  But as of today, having had these Gtablets for six weeks, I'm very happy with what I've got.",

The interesting thing is; I also measured the IO speed of this external SSD disk and the internal hard disk of my iMac with CrystalDiskMark. This external SSD disk clocked in at approx 86 MB/s and the internal hard disk clocked in at 111 MB/s. This means there is no incentive to look for extra-ordinary method to make Windows 7 boot from the external SSD drive. It is not going to be faster anyway. I later found out that 86 MB/s is petty close to max wire speed of FireWire 800. The take away from my little experiment is this; It is possible for a external SSD to be _slower_ than a internal hard disk. You have to also consider the speed of the connection technology.",

The cases are nice to hook on the back of a headrest that moves up and down, but if you have a head rest that is all one piece with your seat you can't really hang them on securely. Also would be nice if the volume was a little louder they seem pretty quiet. Also i like that fact that the top flips up to put a movie in and not down.

It's not just that it is buggy or unfinished (it is \\\\\"experimental\\\\\" after all), but it doesn't refresh the screen like it needs to and the menu system is poorly designed. Wikipedia is usable, but clunky. Google News is nearly inaccessible, and news subscription services sometimes charge more for Kindle access than other forms of delivery.<br /><br />Finally, the touch interface takes a little getting used to. I'm used to using iPads and iPhones, and it takes a little while to adapt to Kindle's touch technology. It isn't too bad, though.<br /><br />With my lack of satisfaction with this product so far, I am not eager to begin paying money for more recent books. I've only had my Kindle for a couple of weeks or so, but my expectations are low for that part of the experience.<br /><br />While I live near some great libraries and have ample access to a lot of reading material, I was hoping that the Kindle would instantly revolutionize my reading lifestyle with easy access to books, especially free or inexpensive public domain texts.

So if the mouse wheel advances you through pages, you may find yourself suddenly twenty pages down the line.  The remote units go to sleep rather quickly (to save batteries), so if you have been using the mouse for a while, and then need to enter a keyboard command, you will likely find the keyboard will take one or more key presses to wake up, and then another press for the intended signal to get through.    These flaws make this equipment unsuitable for detail work (fine brush strokes or tracings in image editors) or software that cannot be backed out of spurious or unintended commands.

When I tried to overclock the board and the cpu I had system restarts, which indicates the board reseting. I have gotten it stable just running regular factory settings and the speed is incredible. Even on factory settings I can run multiple programs at once without a hitch. I reccommend that if your going to purchase this chip, please make sure your mobo is compatible and dont take the cheap way out like I did on the board, buy a good solid board like ASUS or Gigabyte. Make sure its AM3+ socket compatible. Also, the stock cooler is ok but if your going to oc make sure you get a good aftermarket cooler, and with coolers make sure they fit in your case and on your board as I ran into problems with the cooler master hyper cooler not fitting on my cheap board.<br /><br />Overall- 4 out of 5 only because the stock cooler is shit and useless for overclocking and AMD knows its shit,<br />But the speed and performance is impressive and the price is terrific as well.",

No flaws from a technical standpoint. It works just like its price range is going for.<br /><br />BUT! There are a couple severe flaws, and this is where it really hits the fan. The trackpad is GOD AWFUL. It registers presses so poorly that half the time will be spent fidgeting around trying move the cursor. It is not smooth at all, and most of the time it will stop dead in its tracks even if you continue moving your finger. This is because the trackpad is somehow registering two or more presses. I can prove this because it will show arrows indicating you are either scrolling or zooming on a page. I have had cheaper laptops with better trackpads, and trust me, this is nowhere near what I have experienced. For me, its not very convenient carrying around a mouse as I rather prefer using the trackpad more.<br /><br />Another thing to talk about is how it sleeps. You would assume that once you close the display the probook goes into hibernation, which it does ... half the time. When it doesn't, it only turns off the display but keeps the computer on. There will be times I stuff my fully charged probook in my case, and come back to it several hours later burning so hot I could cook an egg on it, not to mention with a near dead battery. I fear that the battery will be short lived and so will my probook.<br /><br />And on a side note, upgrade the RAM. 4 gbs is just not enough. Fingerprint scanner works but is not very efficient half the time. How this probook is $750 on Amazon is beyond me. You can find it at any retail store for around half the price.<br /><br />Final verdict: Good laptop, but expect flaws and buy it somewhere else.",

I immediately unplugged it and let it cool down. I took the advice of other reviews and only charged the netbook when the power was off or it was hibernating. That seemed to resolve the issue. I also think if the adapter starts to melt or get too hot, it's also due to where it is... mine was under a blanket... of course it would melt.

The dual USB ports allowed for easy transfer of information from my older external drives to the drive itself. Initially it came with a 1tb WD hard drive, and I have since changed that out to multiple larger drives. The ReadyNAS sets up everything for you as it detects the new drives.

There are some surprising features, like an HDMI port, a relatively decent camera and a very fast processor. On the other hand it lacks bluetooth, but does have a 3.5mm headphone jack. I am not going to regurgitate the product specs, which are clearly spelled out in the product description. I will provide some highlights that I found interesting on the review sample that I received:<br /><br />DISPLAY: vivid and easy to read. I set mine for maximum brightness and larger fonts since my eyes are not what they use to be.<br /><br />SPEED: actually faster than my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 tablet, so while this is a stripped down tablet, it doesn't skimp on CPU power.<br /><br />EXTRAS: ships with an OTG (On-The-Go) cable that connects to the micro USB port. This allows you to plug in the also included USB Ethernet adapter for directly connecting to hubs, a keyboard or even a multi-port USB hub. It also ships with a 3.5mm cable.<br /><br />POWER CONSUMPTION: it takes about four hours to fully charge this tablet after it falls into the 10% remaining battery range. I got six solid hours of use between charges, which is an hour more than the product specs claim. That was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />OTHER: the camera function is not spectacular - it's not as good as the one in my Samsung tablet or my Note 3 phone, but it still takes relatively decent photos and video. The issue I have is it's a little touchy when you slightly move when taking still photos or in lower light conditions. If that feature is important you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />This also would not recognize any SD card over 32GB that I tried with it. For me that is not an issue because other tablets I have owned have similar limitations. I am mentioning this to set your expectations.<br /><br />DISLIKES: I do not know why this tablet requires a non-standard charger. You get a wall wart with a barrel connector that plugs into the charging port. I almost subtracted a star, but when I considered the price for the tablet I let it slide. The documentation is not that great either, but if you are an experienced Android user you won't need any.<br /><br />I mentioned that this is great for single-purpose use. I am donating this one to my bandleader who is legally blind. She has some vision, but is challenged when it comes to reading music and other visual tasks. [[ASIN:B006LR6K14 MobileSheets]] will address that issue, and also [[ASIN:B006C67NP6 iReal Pro - Music Book & Play Along]] for practice and backing.<br /><br />Bottom line: the key things missing are bluetooth, which can be worked around, and better documentation for folks new to Android. I am still unhappy about the power supply, and would give this 4.5 stars if I could solely because of that. However, this has a lot of pluses and for the price is a bargain.when I considered the price for the tablet I let it slide.

I performed every restart and reset possible, and it still locks up after only a few minutes of being turned on.<br /><br />Now, I am sure it is just a defective device, which is fine, it happens. But what I cannot understand is why the person at the other end of the phone in their customer service department almost refused to do anything except tell me to reset the machine or to take it somewhere where a technician can reset it for me... really? I have been using electronics for my entire life, I think I know how to follow a few directions on resetting a device. I was one of those people in the eighties who could set the clock on their VCR properly, so it is a little insulting that they assumed I was completely clueless.<br /><br />Their products may be fine, but based on the service alone, I will never buy another product of theirs.<br /><br />I hope this helps others to make a more informed choice when looking for a device. Don't just look at the cost, look at the service. That is why I normally spend a few dollars more on higher-quality products backed up by more responsible parent companies.",

Oddly enough, the Transcend 16MB Class 6 is available with and without the reader for virtually the same price.  I'm just lucky I found the Amazon ad that had the reader with the card before I pushed the button to finalize my order for the one without reader.    I also wish Amazon's system would have recommended Class 10 SDHC cards because I wasn't even aware such a thing existed until a week after my order arrived.  I would have sprung a little extra for a little faster, whether I need it or not.  The Class 6 is doing just fine but I always like to buy cutting edge when possible.    My recommendation is to be extremely careful about choosing the card you need for the device you're putting it in or you'll have a mess.  SD, SDHD, SDHC, miniSD, microSD, and others can get confused easily - especially when Class numbers are added as a specification.",

The second thing I noticed was a smell. While in hand reading, I don't smell it, but when close it's there. Is it the worst ever? No. Would it turn off some people? Probably, but I hope not. The leather (real or not I can't  tell) is very soft and very comfortable to touch. The interior padding, while grey against the brown leather, is very thick and soft. I would feel comfortable dropping the case on the floor so I'd say the build and protection is good. I think the case sets itself apart from other cases and I like that. I like having an extrodinary piece of technology wrapped in a  vintage leather looking case. The band that keeps it shut,  while serving it's purpose, also adds to the overall look.  The way the case builds in the kickstand is nice, but I don't read like that. If you like to read with your kindle on a flat surface then this feature is meant for you and works as advertised. Overall, I like the case a lot. It's has the look, the features, and protection I was hoping for. Afterall, you won't find anything else like it in the 25 dollar range. Go ahead and buy without fear.<br /><br />PS I hope you weren't buying this for the reading light, because if you were too bad. I threw it away the moment I laid eyes on it.

Its made out of metal and the fans aren't super loud (but still audible at the highest setting. Nothing out of the ordinary.)<br /><br />Con: I had the same issue with the little legs breaking just a few days after purchase that many other users reported having. The fans seem to have problems getting enough air especially without the extra extension legs. if I turn the fans up as high as they go they can't lift a piece of paper up in the air (not enough air pressure) but if i lift the cooler a few inches off the table, the piece of paper flies right off. Another thing is that the cooler doesn't create good positive air pressure where the fans are. The reason is that there's a pretty good distance between the fans and the top of the cooler and there's a big opening in the front of the cooler which makes all the air vented up by the cooler eject through the front.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you're looking for something that looks cool and not much performance, this is the cooler for you. if you want to cool a gaming laptop or an old machine that overheats, look somewhere else. This is more of a piece of furniture and doesn't significantly cool anything. The fans are good but the design isn't at all.",

But after trying every major brand of USB adapter made, my friend suggested that I try this lesser known brand. He was able to send a signal from his garage separated by 3 walls & a metal carport, across the parking lot, to his downstairs apartment. He had not been able to achieve this with all of the other brands he had tried. The installation was quick & painless & resulted in a \\\\\"good\\\\\" signal strength on his computer system. I have now used the adapter in several \\\\\"difficult\\\\\" installations, all of them resulting in either an \\\\\"excellent\\\\\" or \\\\\"good\\\\\" signal strength found on each system so far.

            "input": "I have been comparing my new kindle paperwhite to the touch this morning and found some things I wanted to share. I noticed that when you turn the light all the way down, it never really goes off. At first I didn't like that, but now I don't mind because it gives you a very slight glow that is helpful in a darker room but not so dark that you need more light. I also noticed that with the light down as far as it will go, the screens are two different colors of gray. This doesn't matter, I just noticed. Also, with the light at any brightness--low or high--the screen is not white but almost blue. Again, this doesn't matter but I hate calling it a paperwhite when it isn't white. Just my OCD coming through.<br /><br />Some things I absolutely love: the light of course, that was the whole reason for getting it. It also has a really great feature where you can see how long it will take you to finish the book or the chapter you are in, based on your reading speed. I love that because two of my previous kindles had dots at the bottom that told you if a chapter was long or short and you could judge about how long it would take you to read it. The touch didn't have those and I missed them. With this feature on the new kindle, it \\\\\"watches\\\\\" you read, times how long it takes you to read something, and calculates how long it will take you to read each chapter and ultimately the whole book. You can set it to glance down at any time and see how long you have left in that chapter. I LOVE that! A lot of people talk about how much faster it is than the touch, but I really can't tell a difference. However, there is more room on the touch than this one, giving it more room to work. Books may download a little faster to the paperwhite, but not enough to make a huge difference. As far as page turns, I found them to be exactly the same. Same with opening a book from your home page. One thing I do like is that you have to mean to turn the page on the paperwhite. On my touch anything would turn the page--a leaf falling onto the screen for instance. I know it is due to each kindle using a different type of touch screen. You can feel the difference too--the touch is smooth while the paperwhite is slightly rough feeling. I like that there isn't as much room between the screen and the casing because my touch stays dusty in the corners unless I get a Q-tip and wipe it out. The paperwhite has less distance between the two so that when you wipe the screen you get the corners too.<br /><br />Some things I don't like: The fonts are different. That shouldn't matter, but it does to me. For one thing, I had to increase the font size by one in order to make the letters the same size as they were on the touch with a smaller size setting. I know that isn't a big deal, but I just didn't like it. Also, I had to set the line spacing further apart. In my opinion the fonts seem to show up bolder and more crisp on the touch than the paperwhite. The light seems to take away some of the contrast, but only a little. Even with the light all the way down, the touch seems bolder and more crisp. Of course, though, the light could not be beat in a darker room. Some other things that bother me: 1) You cannot swipe up and down to go to next or previous chapter. 2) There is an extra step to turning off wi-fi. Rather than just hitting menu and choosing turn off wi-fi, you now have to hit menu, go to settings, then select turn on airplane mode. This turns off wi-fi. 3)I miss having text to speech even though I don't use it that much. 4)No one mentioned that the black spots along the bottom were normal because the lights are located there.<br /><br />I know I have only worked with it a short time, but AT THIS POINT, if I had to choose which one to keep it would be the touch. I want to read on it for a while in different lighting conditions and see how this light affects my eyes before I decide if I am going to send it back.",

The casing isn't the best, (the pocket grasper thing popped right off for instance) and sometimes there's some sort of battery contact problem and you have to tap the laser pointer or screw on the bottum part tighter, but for a 20 dollar green laser pointer that's fine with me.

It is very frustrating to determine what is going on with the system.  It does establish a link but it seems to be intermittent and is not good enough to download movies into the DVR.  It wouldn't be so bad if there were some diagnostic software that I could use to determine what is happening but the Asoka software doesn't seem to do anything.  And as mentioned in other reviews, the Asoka tech support line just connects to an answering machine with no call back.  The email support comes up as a non-deliverable mail address so there is no way to contact them for help.  I have searched in vain (probably not looking in the right place) for a piece of shareware software that would allow me to just go directly between two computers and measure link quality but there doesn't seem to be anything out there.    Bottom line, it may work for you but if it doesn't make sure that you have a way to return it for a refund.

The construction of the plug at the L joint (where the plug goes into the laptop) seems much more sturdy than that in the replacement adapter as well as in the original adapter (which stopped working at around 14 months). The thickness is good since this seems to be the chronic failure point. The wires inside detach from the plug at the solder points, and the cords stop working. I don't know how long this one will last, but I'm hopeful to get at least 6 months out of it. If it stops, however, I'm probably ditching Acer and moving to a different computer brand. The adapter came with a 12 month warranty that I hope to try out if it stops working within that timespan.  I will update this review if the adapter stops working soon. As of today, it has been working for 10 days without fault. However, I have begun to notice a slight deformation in the yellow plastic at the tip of the plug, which makes me worry about its longevity over time. There seems to be some overheating, which could be due to my computer or due to the adapter. Whatever the reason, it sometimes makes the adapter difficult to remove from the computer.

Obviously, how you are going to feel about this depends on how you are going to use or abuse your Kindle.<br /><br />As for ergonomics and features:  No magnetic closure/sleep function, something other users have touched on here.  This cover was clearly built for propping the kindle up to view video or email, vs. holding in the hand, but the notched easel assembly won't stand up to much screen poking (as in the case of game play, for example), without collapsing on itself.  I didn't have a problem with accessing the charge port with the cover secured, so perhaps they fixed that feature.  I also wasn't able to come up with a program that wanted to display \\\\\"upside down\\\\\" as the cover and kindle within is oriented, but of course any program displaying in portrait mode will display \\\\\"sideways\\\\\" on the easel.<br /><br />I'll still be looking into a second (well, now third) cover, hoping my story plays out like the proverbial 3 bears and I can find one that is \\\\\"just right\\\\\".

Although Anker is a relatively new company, with little to their name, people are often skeptical, even though their products are spectacular quality and well-priced. After purchasing a series of different mice, including both wired and wireless, gaming and non-gaming mice, I have finally found the best one, of them all.<br /><br /> Anker's Gaming Mouse has many amazing features. Besides the outstanding 2000DPI (up to 4000DPI by software), the mouse also offers a great variety of built-in LED light colors, a well-built structure and a well-designed ergonomic feel. Whether you're a gamer or not, this mouse is well made, creative, colorful and guaranteed to stand out and awe-inspire your friends.<br /><br /> I use Anker's Gaming Mouse to do many things. These things include: Surf the web (casually), play FPS (First Person Shooter) games on my PC, a variety of other non-FPS games, and accurately edit/create digital design on Photoshop. Only on this mouse, is my experience 100% flawless, with no jittering, solely what my hand does. With as high level of accuracy as this mouse has, the possibilities are beyond imagination. You can do everything you do with your current mouse, but most likely better!<br /><br /> Pros:<br /> 1. Low priced.<br /> 2. Sturdy plastic design.<br /> 3. 2000 DPI, and up to 4000 by software.<br /> 4. Easy to customize \\\\\"profiles\\\\\" for certain sensitivities and DPI speeds for select games.<br /> 5. Fresh LED lighting.<br /> 6. 7 Programmable Buttons.<br /><br /> Cons:<br /> I haven't found any yet.<br /><br /> Regardless if you're in the market for the new mouse or not, I would definitely suggest purchasing this mouse (even as a spare if you're not in the market for a new mouse). Don't bother spending $50+ on a mice from another manufacturer, instead, pay a lower price, and get nothing but a higher quality experience.<br /><br /> Their customer supportis outstanding as well! I myself have not had to contact customer support (being everything has gone so well), but I have seen the responses by their customer support team, on other reviews on their products. I must say, I wish other tech-companies had as reliable customer service teams as Anker.<br /><br /> Outstanding buy! Anker is officially my favorite brand for any gaming peripherals.",

Sharkk SK2541 MMO Laser Gaming Mouse - does EXACTLY what I want and feels great! $40 too :)  6/30/15 PM - received reply from tech support. the software and mouse does not support click and hold at all. they did not offer any alternative. i now have a $65 paper weight - but its still staying on long term storage - the mouse hunt continues.  6/30/15 - revised down to 1 star ... i got my new RAT TE mouse replacement and even though the cursor does not float away, it squirrels with small movement = not accurate ... so i lament that my Corsair M65 RGB does not support press-hold in any form. this is a software design that i wish Corsair would implement. I just read another persons post on the Corsair forums that pretty much sums up what i also require... seems that a lot of us do, but apparently not enough for Corsair to rewrite software for. Alas. http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=141442 ... in the future - if they do integrate this feature, i will use the mouse immediately. until then, it's in a long term storage box. i'll check the site and forums periodically to see if it becomes a feature.  6/12/15 - revised down to 2 stars from 4 ... the mouse still works - but the software or what it does not allow is what everyone needs to be aware of. the mouse and software does not support any-key press and hold. this completely kills using push to talk or any WASD assignments for strafing, etc. Again, the mouse is accurate and very responsive ... but this lack of press and hold - even with macros - is nearly a game breaker ... i am hoping for a software update in the near future from Corsair to implement this.  6/6/15 - just got today as a replacement for the failed 'Mad Catz R.A.T.TE Tournament Edition Gaming Mouse for PC and Mac' (see review on that page). The M65 RGB is accurate, precise, and instantaneous on my maxed out win7 pro 64 HP 17 Z-book. Once i dialed in the software, it was perfect. buy this mouse ... i will be quite upsetif anything fails within the first year. 4 stars as i have to wear a wrist brace (been doing computer design and stuff for over 20 years) ... so this is not an issue if you are not wearing a brace, but it is about 1/2&#34; longer than i would have liked. without the brace, it fits my XXL hands perfectly - easy octave-and-a-forth each hand on the piano.",

I finally found a different third party firmware and different firmware installer program that came with it.  Using the other installer program Tomato finally installed correctly.

It gets a bit frustrating, and I catch myself not putting the cover back on, which defeats the purpose.  The second thing is, I REALLY wish there was a hole/port for the camera so you could still use it when you have the cover snapped onto the back as you do when using the hand strap.  They would have had to move one of the attachment points but I think it would have been worth it.  I really need access to the camera for barcode scanning and whatnot.

Pros: Pretty good deal for the price, VERY powerful (to say the least) and has a battery life of 1-2 hours.

Cons: The graphics aren't switchable initially, one has to first download and install an updated BIOS, THEN go into the bios and configure switchable graphics. Then finally you're able to right click on your desktop and actually switch the graphics. If you do not do this, the laptop will always use the Intel card, even though it will claim that it is auto-switchable.     Overall this is a great machine, but it does come with a lot of crap-ware and needs the BIOS updated to use the Radeon 6770m graphics card for gaming.

The system is cooled via a Swiftech extreme water-cooling kit with two CPU waterblocks and one GPU waterblock.  I wanted the option of checking that my water loop was functional when the case was sealed with its side panels.  I planned to use the CL-W0033 for that purpose<br /><br />EXPECTATIONS<br /><br />[1]  Successful mating with my 1/2 ID water loop<br />[2]  High-temperature alarm to alert me when there is a temperature anomaly<br />[3]  High quality material for product longevity<br />[4]  Sufficient wire length for monitor installation in drive bay<br /><br />RESULTS<br /><br />[1]  I use PrimoChill PrimoFlex tubing, which is a thicker tubing.  Although the CL-W0033 comes with an attachment for 1/2 ID tubing, the PrimoFlex was too thick for that adapter to work.  I improvised by using a zip tie to secure the tubing to the 1/2\\\\\" nipple.  The 1/2\\\\\" nipple is not exceedingly long, but the zip tie has worked.  In 18 months of continuous use, I have not experienced a leak.<br /><br />[2]  Once I was working on my system and I forgot to reconnect the power cable to the circulation pump.  I powered on the system and the CL-W0033 sounded its alarm.  I immediately powered off the system and performed an inspection.  The CL-W0033 had saved my very expensive CPUs.<br /><br />[3]  The sensor body appears to be high quality, but also lightweight.  It is easy to mount with zip ties and is quite sturdy.  I disassembled the unit when I flushed the system (FluidX created particulates) and noted the fine machining and tight tolerances.  The sensor body is of excellent quality.  The display box is plastic, but it meets my expectations.  There are only two mounting screws on the half width mounting bracket, which is okay, but I would have prefer a full width bracket so that I could use four mounting screws.  The display is bright and the sampling frequency adequate.<br /><br />[4]  My chassis is a Lian Li V2100, which is a voluminous chassis.  The included wiring between the sensor body and display box is adequate for my chassis, which means that it will be adequate for any chassis.<br /><br />Afterthoughts:  There are two modifications that I would make to this item:  (1) sleeve the power cable to the display box.  Currently the power cable consist of a red and black relatively large gauge wire with sufficient length to accommodate a large chassis.  Given the length and thickness of the power wires, they are disruptive to an orderly wired/tubed chassis.  I removed the power connector, trim the wire lengths for my chassis, and sleeved them.  (2) a small mount for the sensor body.  I made a mount, but it would have been nice to have one included.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />I am 100% satisfied with this product.  It has met all of my expectations and saved my CPUs from overheating as a consequence of the circulation pump not being powered.  The components are all high quality and are expected to have a long life cycle.  I would highly recommend this comment to a colleague.cy adequate.

As some of you already know it, the Kindle Fire costs only $199 with IPS capacitive screen, duo core and 8GB.  So if you can get this tablet under $200, you get a pretty good deal if you want something decent with a front camera for video call.  Otherwise, the other good bet is MID 7022 which has a capacitive screen.  -----------------  Ok, there are a lot of things to be said about this tablet.  Some other reviewers have rated this tablet as bad as it could be (e.g. freezes, and etc...).  True and not true.  I have a Toshiba Thrive 16GB.  Comparing a 16GB 10\\\\\" screen Tegra 2 with 1GB of RAM to this little toy seems unfair, but this tablet is not bad.  You just must know how to fully utilize the Viewpad 7e.  The PROs:  - white case  - small form factor (i.e. 7 inch screen)  - front and rear camera  - Android 2.3  - microSD slot  - 4 buttons below screen  - sound  The CONs:  - limited 4GB storage  - 512 MB RAM  - single core  - screen resolution  ------------------  I was able to install Google Market.  It's really not that hard when you make some research on how to install it.  BUT I've found it useless because it's not the up-to-date one.    The 1Market and the Appstore pre-installed in the Viewpad 7e are good enough.  You just have to make yourself as a SuperUser.  Also, the device is already configure for the user to be able to move installed applications to the SD.  Or if you want you can install App2SD for free.  ------------------  Knowing that you have only 4GB, a single core, and 512 MB RAM to play with, you must know how to work with what you got.  The key is to clear any unnecessary program when not in use, not to use the 3D Launch (a.k.a. SPB Shell), and definitely NO Live Wallpaper.  It may sound easier said than done, right???  Well, there's a free app for that's called Gemini Taskiller Widget program.  After installation and setup, all you need to do is to shake the device so that it would clear your RAM every time after you close a program to open another one.  My 8 year old girl can do it.  Why can't you?  ----------------  With QQ Player installed, I can even play RMVB!  MKV can also be played for animation episodes.  This is all a cool and cheap tablet that can do it all with restrictions of course.  Overall, for something under $200, it is a nice tablet. I got mine for $170 during Black Friday.    The other thing I want to mention is the screen.  It's more resistive than capacitive.  It also means that it is not as hard as gorilla glass of course.    I was a little put off by it, but I eventually get use to it.  It is not that bad.  It's like in a Nintendo DS, if not better.  It is acceptable.  Although the resolution is not that high, it is really acceptable when watching NON-HD episodes.  Let's face it!  Who got enough bandwidth and time to download HD episodes regurlarly???  I was one of them, but then if you car recommended fuel is 87, why pay/waste for better grade?  On my Toshiba Thrive, when I play RMVB episodes, the pictures are very blurry because of the lower resolution format.  On this baby, it looks more acceptable on a smaller screen @ a lower resolution.  --------------------  The other downside is the Wifi.  I have really good reception.  I have good signal even when I am in another room with closed door.  The problem is that it seems to go to sleep even when I have set up Wifi to never go to sleep.  I have also set my device with static IP, and the trouble still persists whenever the device is left unused for a while.  No problem.  The solution is to reset the Wifi, and to find an easy way to do it. Just put a Wifi toggle switch as a widget in different pages, and flick it off and on whenever programs stop seeing any network connection. This usually happens after the tablet has been left unused for a while (e.g. charging).  Of course, in my more expensive Tablet (i.e. the Thrive), I do nothave this problem.  Hopefully, there will be an update soon to fix this problem.  But then again, I know my way around it.  -----------------  The sound on this tablet is pretty impressive.  I did not expect it to be that good.  The Toshiba Thrive has stereo speaker.  This Viewpad 7e only has one, but it sounds better than my Toshiba Thrive!!!  How so? Acoustic design. The Toshiba Thrive stereo speakers just throw sounds straight from the bottom. The Viewpad 7e resonates through the tablet nicely with only one speaker to make it more lively (kind of like a tube TV in hand)! Simply amazing! And with a white case, it's just class (with restrictive power).    - But as a Toshiba Thrive owner, I really have some hard time swallowing this. Yes, a bit mad indeed about what the Viewpad 7e can throw in the sound department. -  -----------------  Also, after installing programs (then move them to SD if possible), don't forget to reboot, then test the program.  The battery is adequate.  You just have to tune down the screen brightness, and lower the volume whenever you can.  My daughter just crams the volume to the MAX, and she still gets some good kicks for about 3 hours.  Good enough for me! I don't want her to be in front of the screen too long.  -----------------  Like I said, once you know how to operate this baby, for the price it is a steal if you can find it close to the price range of a MID 7200.  At least with the Viewpad 7e, you can still use Skype or other programs to do video call.  The Kindle Fire can't.  Also, the Viewpad has expandable microSD storage that you can total up to 36GB (4+32).  But it is no duo core, nor does it have IPS screen.  It is what it is.  It just depends what you want for something close to $200.  Otherwise, save your money, and buy an Iconia A100 for more $$$!",

Most of the newer, more expensive units use a USB3 header off the mobo, which seems silly considering that most boards only have 1 USB3 header (if they have one at all), and that's taken by the front USB ports on most towers.  Furthermore, most can only read one card at a time.  This unit uses USB2, which is plenty fast for most people's uses (simple file transfers) and there's usually several extra headers on the board. It reads SDHC (SD cards over 32 gigs), can use read from multiple cards at once, and is generally great.  Cons: The blue LED light on the front is absurdly bright. That isn't an issue for me because my case has a door covering the drive bays, but it's something to keep in mind.  The other thing to be aware of is that it reserves a drive letter for each card type. This allows the user of multiple cards and is a great feature, but you may have to go into disk management and reassign drive letters. My external drive wasn't plugged in when I installed it and it somehow overwrote my previously reserved drive letter (E:).  It messed up some file paths until I reassigned everything. It's a 3 minute fix, but is annoying if you aren't expecting it.  Also, don't make the same silly mistake I did and forget to order a 5.25-3.25 inch bay adaptor of you're sticking this in below your DVD drive. I had to wait 3 more days to install.  All in all, this is an amazing value. It's cheaper and better for my needs than other products.",

The battery life is great!! this Tablet will last me 8 hours ATLEAST, and that's with continual use. I use it mostly for my job as a network administrator, I like to access my network drives wherever I am, and be able to log into my server when away from my desk. I never liked carrying around a laptop, even a netbook was kind of awkward, I would rather be able to stand, then have to sit down to use my portable device.<br /><br />The only issues I have had, is with the digitizer pen. It's not perfect, and re-calibrating it doesn't seem to improve anything, but at least there is a crosshair that shows on the screen when you get the pen close enough, so even if it is off a little, you know where your going to press by looking at the crosshairs. Lenovo's pre-installed software/apps are nothing special either.<br /><br />Other issues I have had:<br />Firefox likes to crash occasionally<br />The display will sometimes go dim, then brighten back up for no reason.<br />Digitizer isn't perfectly accurate<br />My 1Tb external USB 2.0 hard drive wont connect. (I have read similar reviews stating the same thing. I read another review where someone was able to get there 500Gb external to work, maybe its just on 1Tb and up.<br />Atom processor isn't the fastest, but from what I have read, its better than the ARM. You can actually run x86 (32 bit) programs on this device.<br /><br />Things I love about this Tablet.<br />Its weight, I have no issues holding it all day, and I'm not what you would call a physically fit man.<br />The battery life is amazing.<br />Its form factor is really sleek<br />Digitizer pen (although not perfect) really comes in handy when trying to navigate thru windows explorer/desktop.<br />I'm really liking windows 8, not sure why everyone is hating on it, other than people just like tohate on Microsoft.<br /><br />Oh and more thing, I can actually run Civilization IV with no issues :)",

So far I have uploaded only using the WiFi and although it works rather well it is slow. All together I have uploaded around 1400 photos and 60 videos. When uploading from the IPad I was able to get it all done in one attempt but when uploading from the Galaxy S5 it kept hanging up. My solution to that was to upload a couple hundred photos at a time and when I was completely  done with the photos I then uploaded the videos about a dozen at a time this seemed to work allot better than trying to do it all in one batch. Now that they are all uploaded I will periodically use the &#34;auto upload&#34; feature so that I don't have to load so many files at once. I have not figured out how to upload files yet using cables and I'm not sure it is possible with the iPad or galaxy. All in all it's a great device and I love that the wifi doesn't need the internet. I haven't tried steaming with it yet so I can't comment on that. Also with 1TB it'll be along time until I need another one seeing as I am mainly using it for photos and short home vids.<br /><br />*** I almost forgot to mention this but one thing I noticed was that the size of the app on the iPad grew almost to the size of my entire photo gallery (3.5GB). I thought it was strange so I deleted the app an reinstalled it and that seemed to work. If I wouldn't have been able to do that the drive wouldn't have done me any good because that was the main (make space on the ipad) reason I purchased it.",

A8 AMD Quad core processor, 6 gigs of RAM (A 4GB stick & 2GB stick, both made by ELPIDA. I upgraded to the full 8GB capacity with a 4GB stick from G.SKILL. The AMD mahine is upgradable to 8GB, has a 640GB HD (the HD is made by Toshiba...what is this? coopetition? LOL) For the most part it has everything it promises.<br /><br />Everything works fine. This is a lot of PC for the money. No argument there.<br /><br />I was disappointed that HP's Mediasmart software suit is gone. You have to pay extra to get the features from the included software that were standard with the old Mediasmart package (the PC I bought that had it was last year's model - the hp dv6-3120us). Some people might find it \\\\\"gimmicky\\\\\" but the kids liked to play with \\\\\"special effects\\\\\" on the webcam and now I have to pay an extra $24.99 to add it to the included software on the new PC. If you want the \\\\\"Ultra\\\\\" version of Cyberlink's software for DVD's & Blue-Ray it's $59.99 for hp users (normally $79.99). Almost all the software is upgradable. If hp really wants to go head to head with the MPA or MBP, those sweet machines INCLUDE all the software you need for movies & music.<br /><br />The fingerprint reader is very nice. Sometimes it takes a few tries but its better than entering passwords.<br /><br />The HD webcam is pretty good, but it's performance has a lot to do with your ISP, if you are conferencing.<br /><br />Wireless connection worked immediately during set up.<br /><br />Battery Life, for me, has been outstanding. Considering everything that is going on inside this laptop it is running longer than I expected. Almost 5 hours on a single charge.<br /><br />This notebook runs very cool & very quiet. Even the optical drive doesn't make much noise when running at top speed. I can hear the Hard Drive when it's being accessed. It's not super loud butit is noticeable. My gf's MBP does the same thing.<br /><br />I have a word to say about the \\\\\"Xbox deal\\\\\". It's OVER as of 8-15-11. Was looking forward to a free Xbox 360 but the deadline has passed.<br /><br />The finish on the PC is fantastic. It doesn't show dust or fingerprints. That is a HUGE plus to me. It's actually brushed aluminum. Very classy.<br /><br />The PC said it was only using 25% of the original 6GB of RAM. The 16GB max capacity only applies to this PC when configured with an Intel i7 Quad Core processor. The 640GB HD is just under 600GB in reality but on the plus side it is very fast.<br /><br />1080p output is possible through the HDMI output to your HDTV. The included display can only support playback of up to 720p. The Blue Ray drive cannot burn hi-speed CD-R's & it will require software updates periodically according to the included literature. Just something to be aware of in my opinion.<br /><br />Great PC on paper and hp definitely has a winning combination here.",

I read multiple reviews on each, WATCHED video reviews on each, and talked to 2 or 3 IT professionals to get their impressions/thoughts.  I went to countless stores to play with each device (repeatedly), and I came away with the following verdict:  there is no 'winner' and each device CLEARLY has distinct advantages.<br /><br />iPad:  I love Apple products.  They're elegant, simple, reliable, and (in their own way) works of art.  I already have a desktop and a laptop, so I wanted something VERY portable (i.e. could fit into my handbag)... granted, if I had a BIG handbag, an iPad would fit, but truly the size makes it a bit cumbersome.  PLUS at $499, it was way more expensive than the other two options.  (Two strikes against the iPad.)<br /><br />Nook Tablet:  I love my local Barnes & Noble.  It's one of the last great 'brick and mortar' bookstores.  There are few things I enjoy more on a rainy Sunday than wandering the stacks at B&N.  Plus the advantages to the Nook:  there is more 'onboard' storage space than the Kindle.  You can go into any B&N and read any of their titles for 1 hour per day (free).  Last, there's always a human at the B&N who can answer your questions and help you.<br /><br />Kindle Fire:  (the eventual winner).  First, amazing price tag:  $199.  Really?  Is that a typo?  No, seriously, it's $199.  It's portable, sturdy, I can hold it in one hand, put it in my handbag, AND it does everything I want it to do.  Does it make phone calls?  Nope, but hey I have a smartphone.  Does it take pictures or videos?  Nope, but hey I have a little point-and-shoot digital that works just fine thank you.  What I CAN do with my Kindle Fire is surf the internet, check Facebook, send emails, watch instant videos (you get 1 month of Amazon Prime free with purchase, and TRUST ME, you will love this...) and READ to my heart's content (and boy do I love to read...)  You can read magazines, newspapers and books.  Oh yes, you can listen to MUSIC too.  And of course, there is the app functioning and gaming stuff you can do if you're so inclined..<br /><br />A couple items of note:  1)  the 'reading' screen:  I've heard mixed reviews on this; however, I love the screen.  You can change the font, point size, brightness of the screen, etc.  You can also read 'portrait-style' or 'landscape-style'.  You can highlight, make notes, and use bookmarks.  It's great.<br />2)  the on/off button.  Apparently there are folks out there who have accidentally hit the off button.  OOPS.  There's an easy fix, Einstein.  Just flip the Kindle 1/4 turn to the right or 1/4 turn to the left and - VOILA - problem solved.  The on/off button is no longer a potential problem.  (Really, this is such a non-issue I'm surprised people are bringing it up.)<br />3)  LAST (and this was the BIG clincher for me)... there are soooo many free and really cheap books at Amazon.  When I compared e-book prices between B&N and Amazon, there was a BIG difference.  Now, for people who don't read much, this might not be an issue, but if you read a lot, and B&N prices are $2 - $4 more PER book... that will add up.<br /><br />Bottom line:  each device is different and has pros and cons...  make sure you really investigate, take the time to play with each one, and purchase the best one for you and YOUR needs.<br /><br />Regardless, the technology we have access to now is truly amazing!

This is a challenge when they're set close together (i.e. with the ports on a motherboard).<br /><br />While it's possible that I'm having bum luck from heavy usage, the consensus of other reviews I've seen seems to be that longevity is an issue with these things.

            "input": "Logitech's Z-3 speakers are a quality set of basic stereo-plus-subwoofer speakers for use with a computer, game unit, or small near-field (close-up) audio setup. They are quite pretty, with faux-wood cabinets and brushed metal accents, and despite their small size are quite heavy. While the set is not exceptionally loud for its rated power, the subwoofer provides substantial bass (perhaps too much at higher settings), and the stereo mid- and high-range satellite speakers offer smooth sound, an attractive and functional design, and solid metal bases for stability. The wired remote, with its simple power button, large analog volume knob, and funky blue LED power light, is an especially nice design.<br />I purchased the Z-3 speakers for use with a digital stage piano in our living room. Logitech includes a wired-in male mini-stereo plug (the kind that connects to a computer, portable CD player, or other mini-headphone jack), as well as an adapter that converts the mini plug to two female RCA jacks, which plug into standard left and right RCA cables used by stereo systems. I needed additional adapters (which I had, fortunately) to convert those RCA connectors to 1/4&quot; mono phono plugs on the musical keyboard, but that was to be expected, since the Z-3s aren't aimed at musicians anyway.<br />Wiring up the system was straightforward: the power plug is part of the subwoofer, so you don't have to worry about multiple power cables snaking around-which also means there's no way to run the satellite speakers alone, without the subwoofer. Oddly, you must separate the main cables (which connect the subwoofer to the satellites and remote in a bundle) by peeling the wires away from each other, like licorice strips, to get them to the length you need, which is something the otherwise-good (and very short) manual fails to mention. As shipped, the free cables are too short to reach either side of a computer monitor, never mind a piano. Some might be wary of doing any wire-separating without anything in writing to make clear that it's safe (which it is, since you're just peeling off some rubber). The satellites are very nicely designed, with two stable cast-metal feet and removable soft speaker grilles that protect from poking fingers but don't seem to colour the sound significantly.<br />The volume remote is worth a mention on its own. Some PC speakers provide all sorts of doodads on the remote (or just put the controls on one of the speakers), and they often use little clicky buttons to control the volume. The Z-3 gives you just the basics, and is better for it. There is a power switch (which doubles as mute-just turn the power off!) and a very large, smooth-feeling old-style volume knob. There is a standard mini-headphone jack, slightly recessed, which could be awkward if your phones have a bulky plug, but none of mine do. The LED power button is a trendy blue, and perhaps a tad bright if you use it in a dark room. The remote itself is plastic, but feels solid and well built, like the rest of the set.<br />Although the Z-3s are rated at 40 watts total power (17 for the two satellites, 23 for the subwoofer), they don't seem to have much more overall real-world volume than my old Yamaha YST-M7 computer speakers, which lack a subwoofer and are only supposed to put out 10 watts total. That shows how meaningless wattage ratings really are for these kinds of speakers. But it's good for me, since my young daughters tend to turn everything to 10 if given a chance, and when 10 isn't that loud, it can be a relief. If you crank up the Z-3 subwoofer (it has a separate bass knob on the back), you can get room-shaking bass, of course, but at the expense of being able to hear much high-end articulation from the satellites. Apparently, if you have a hotter source signal than the piano I used, turning the Z-3s up yields too much high end in the sound, but I didn't find that in our setup.<br />With the stage piano, I found a subwoofer setting just a few notches above minimum to work best. The high keys give a realistic tinkle, while the lowest ones vibrate the keyboard authentically, and the midrange is rich and lush. Overall, the Z-3s beat my old Yamahas for overall richness and evenness of sound. Audiophiles might disagree, but they'd be spending hundreds or thousands of dollars for speakers, while the Z-3s barely break three figures in Canadian dollars. It would be nice to have some equalization control for the midrange and high end, but few computer speaker systems offer that, and it's always possible to add an external EQ unit between the sound source and the speakers if you insist.<br />There are less expensive &quot;2.1&quot; PC speaker systems, as well as more powerful and better-sounding ones, but if you want a set of speakers that look good in addition to sounding just fine for most near-field, low-volume applications, the Logitech Z-3 might be your ticket. For my application, they're great.",

I wanted a H.D. with a little more capacity and speed than the original Western Digital 320 GB one from Dec 2009 that had developed 42 MB of bad sectors on it. This computer was bought in late 2010, and I was disappointed that the H.D. was already failing after only 3.5 yrs. This was the first W.D. drive that has ever failed me. I still have ones from 2005 & 2006 that are still going strong!<br /><br />Replacing the H.D. turned out to be the easiest part---taking off the rear support stand bracket was the hardest. It required a very thin #1 Phillips screwdriver to be able to access the bracket screws. The removal of the computer's plastic back cover was straight forward.<br /><br />I partitioned the 750 GB WD drive into two partitions using &#34;PartedMagic&#34;, which turned out to be fairly easy!<br />I also installed a jumper on pins 5&6 to turn it into a SATA II drive, to match it to the original 320GB H.D. computer's configuration.<br /><br />Luckily I had made &#34;Recovery Disks&#34; when the MSI computer was originally purchased in Oct. 2010, so re-installation of Windows 7 Home, 32-bit, turned out to be quite easy, taking about 50 min. I also didn't have to re-register with Microsoft, since the operating system was already pre-registered by the manufacturer. Installing on a larger H.D. didn't turn out to be a problem. Nice! The hardest, and most time consuming part, was re-installing all the latest Microsoft updates. What a hassle!!!<br /><br />I have not done any speed tests with this new drive, but it seems to be working properly. I ran a quick W.D. diagnostic on the new drive, and everything was fine. No bad sectors!<br /><br />I would recommend this H.D. for any desktop or laptop that takes a 3.5 inch format drive!  I didn't need a larger 1 or 2 terabyte drive, so this 750 GB one turned out to be a nice compromise. 7200 RPM, SATA III, and a 64 MB cache are all pluses!",

For the most part, this product functions precisely as advertised: on all flat and most flat-ish surfaces, it props up an iPad.  On most sloping and all crazy sloping surfaces, it does not prop up an iPad.  But then, who would expect it to?  And who would take the chance it might fail to?  Some users appear to have had difficulties balancing their iPads on the ViewLounge.  If you're familiar with the law of gravity, and stick to flatter surfaces, you should have no problem keeping your own iPad steadily balanced atop its ViewLounge perch.  On balance, ViewLounge strikes me as a useful enough device.  But it's not something I'd ever go out and buy.  Less one star because it is, after all, a $21 beanbag with a plastic clip.<br /><br />UPDATE: I had previously given this item 4 stars for the reasons noted above.  After using this item some more, I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars.  Yes, this is a simple concept.  But it's very well executed, and it serves it's purpose to a tee.  Being able to prop up my iPad on the arm of my couch or lounge chair is a real boon, and something I'm not able to do with standard iPad stands.  So, for that reason alone, I think this is a terrific niche item.  And it's quite sturdily constructed as well.  Contrary to my previous assessment, $21 strikes me as entirely reasonable.  And knowing what I now know, this is definitely an item I'd go out and buy.",

The multi-touch gestures are exactly what you would expect coming from iOS or OS X. It has a space at the bottom providing a physical click if you need to drag and drop. The battery life is excellent, and it even works (without the multi-touch gestures of course) with my Dell laptop at work.<br /><br />My only gripe, and it's a small one, is that the physical click space at the bottom doesn't work if you're mousing on a soft surface. I suppose I should have expected that and it makes sense, but it limits what I can do while using this on the couch as I normally would, unless I put a book under it.

What a total joke, waiting on the phone for 30 minutes without talking to a human I give up, they're both going back.

            "input": "I purchased this Logitech G500 mouse after my Logitech G400's left-click wore out. Suffice to say, I was disappointed, but there is some good about this mouse. For example, the shape is very similar to the G400's, but slightly improved. The buttons are longer and the grips on the sides are better. When I gripped the G400, my fingers would hang over the edges and my hand would begin to hurt after a while - not so with the G500. The new improvements made the mouse a lot more comfortable. Even though it comes off as a bit gimmicky, I did like the dual-mode scroll wheel for moving through long Skype conversations quickly. I also liked the braided cord, which feels a lot more durable than the G400's cable. One of the best things for me was Logitech's decision to move the DPI up/down buttons onto the side of the left mouse button instead of on either side of the scroll wheel, where I would accidentally hit them on occasion when scrolling through documents or changing weapons in games.<br /><br />Which leads me to the cons of the mouse...<br /><br />First of all, the sensor is inherently flawed. The Avago ADNS-9500 will act up in a bad way depending on what kind of mousepad you have. With a soft mat, you'll see 5% negative acceleration. On a hard pad like the Steelseries 4HD or Razer Scarab, you'll see small amounts of positive acceleration. It's especially noticeable at lower sensitivities. Prediction has never been much of an issue for me, but acceleration is intolerable. That was my biggest reason for returning the mouse. I also found the weight cartridge to be incredibly useless because of it's placement inside the mouse. The slot for the cartridge is at the back at the mouse, so when you place the cartridge inside, the weight becomes unevenly distributed, which bothered me a lot. I'm also not a big fan of the sensor's placement on the mouse. To make room for the weight cartridge, the sensor has been off-centered, which can result in subtle changes in how the sensor tracks. I found upwards motions to be quicker than downwards motions, which was extremely frustrating in-game.<br /><br />All in all, if you can deal with the sensor flaws, enjoy the weight cartridge, and love the shape, this mouse is probably for you. But those who want a mouse with a cleaner sensor (such as the ADNS-3090) and don't need features like the weight cartridge, I'd say look elsewhere. The Razer Deathadder, Abyssus, Logitech G100s, and Logitech G400 are all excellent alternatives with prediction and acceleration-free sensors, along with solid customization options.acks.

The marketing pitch: The &#34;kid&#34; (or regular) mode displays items in a very straightforward and clickable manner making it very easy to select programs or functions - quite similar to an iPhone or iPad. There are many pre-loaded apps and games so it's easy to become familiar with the Nabi's capabilities. The &#34;mommy&#34; (or advanced) mode turns the Nabi into a sophisticated computer. In this mode you can pretty much do anything a regular tablet can do. Mommy mode determines the apps and functionality allowed in kid mode. Mommy mode also let's mom or dad use nabi as their personal tablet. My personal disappointment with Nabi is how advanced kid mode actually is. I assumed it would be very basic and easy-to-use for kids, but it's really not. Even just the clicking between screens is difficult and not very logical. For example, I would assume that a back button would be big and easy to use, especially for little kids' awkward inaccurate fingers, but this is not the case. The area to click the back button is in a tiny clickable area on the lower left hand side which is hard to see, illogically placed, and difficult for even an adult to accurately click. The camera function isn't very easy to use, the apps require much &#34;clicking-through&#34;, and everything just seems very tiny and hard to click. For something that is supposed to be kid-friendly, I am surprised at how kid un-friendly it is. I would even call this mommy-unfriendly as it definitely takes some practice to figure out the mommy-mode or even how to use the kid-mode. So far, this has been a lot of mommy having to click through the kid mode, find the video that the kid wants, turn it on, and hand it to the kid. Also, it is very annoying that the battery doesn't seem to last that long, and even more annoying that the Nabi doesn't come with a simple stand. I would say mostpeople probably buy this as a graduation from their kid constantly using their parents' iPad, to finally having a version of their own. But I think it can become more of a burden than a solution. I wonder if there might be something else that works better.",

            "input": "Others have written some great in-depth reviews here and elsewhere already, and there are plenty of resources online that clearly explain what the Chrome OS is capable of and what it's not good for.  So I don't feel a need to go into great detail here. My review is for those who are already familiar and comfortable using Chrome and extensions, understand the limitations of the platform, and and are just looking for a very cost effective yet reasonably capable Chromebook to have next to the bed or TV, and are now just looking up reviews for specific Chromebook models.<br /><br />If you get these during a Black Friday or similar sales event, you can pick these ASUS Chromebooks up for around 150-ish. For that price this computer is amazing.<br /><br />There are only 2 things I really wish were different, both of which aren't likely to happen unless there is a significant price increase: backlit keyboard and double the memory.<br /><br />If you like to use a computer in bed, or watching TV, chances are it'll be pretty dark. Unfortunately the letters on the keyboard are small and not bright on this Asus Chromebook, so the brightness from the screen may not be enough to see the keyboard clearly.<br /><br />The other issue is memory.<br />This Chromebook comes with 2 Gigs of memory and you can't upgrade. This is fine for basic browsing but depending on how many extensions you have installed, 2 Gigs may sometimes not quite be enough to get a really smooth experience out of it. I found that installing Adblock extension helped bring down some of the excessive memory use at times but it's not a universal fix by any means and my observation may well be incidental. One example is Facebook. FB has tons of trackers and ads pulling away resources at all times. Loading FB pages (not through apps or extensions, just regular webpage) can take a long time on a low memory machine. I find that Adblock cuts this down by at least half. Engadget is another one on occasion. The Gmail app canbe pretty memory heavy if you have a lot of emails in your inbox. The same is true for many other sites that go nuts with their ads and trackers. I find that this has gotten worse. This Chromebook, and most other Chromebooks, were conceived at a time when 2 Gigs was fine for basic online use. Over the past 2 years, however, many sites have dramatically increased their tracking and ad serving mechanisms, all of which tend to hog more memory. If you think this is BS, time load times on a regular Windows machine with and without ad blocking enabled. See what I mean?<br /><br />The more extensions you have active, the more resources you'll need. It's true that most extensions use a very small amount of memory running in the background, but they do add up. If you have lots of extensions, and frequent ad-heavy sites, 2 Gigs apparently isn't enough sometimes. I've experienced several low memory crashes (&#34;He's Dead, Jim&#34;- screen on Chrome). Disabling extensions to the bare minimum helped. If you're comfortable with the terminal you could mess with zram (swap enable) but if that's not your bag, and you need those 50 extensions running at all times, expect the occasional hiccup.<br /><br />Why do I keep harping on this? Because Chromebook is incredible with extensions. There are a LOT of things you can do with the right app or extension. But again, the more you have, the more memory you need. And since you can't upgrade you want to really think about this limitation.<br /><br />The battery lasts a surprisingly long time even with moderate use, anywhere from 8 to 10+ hours in my experience. The sleep function helps. It charges up quickly, too, the supplied AC adapter does a great job.<br /><br />The screen quality is acceptable, nothing more. Don't expect to judge color accuracy on photos with this. Videos looks a little washed out and HD videos on Youtube sometimes look pretty bad. But again, for casual use this is totally fine.<br /><br />The trackpad, while quite large, isn't great. It's not very accurate but should do fine for basic use. You can always pair a mouse with this if you need to have accurate and more comfortable control over the cursor.<br /><br />The C300 is very light. The specs claim a bit over 3 pounds but somehow it feels lighter. The somewhat cheap feel of the plastic probably helps with the illusion, but I like it.<br /><br />You already know that you can only install extensions and apps made for Chromebook. And while the selection of extensions and apps is very extensive, some notable options are missing. If you don't want to or can't use Gmail as your sole email client for your non-Gmail accounts, you'll be looking for a decent third party email client extension or app. Let me know when you find one because as of May 2015, there aren't any good ones. The ones that are there are severely limited, often don't work with MS Exchange, or have some other limitations and bugs. It's a bit weird, actually - you'd think something as basic as email would be taken care of by now. For most users, the Gmail app is fine. You can use third party emails through Gmail but it's a hassle, doesn't always work smoothly (emails sometimes come in late), and Exchange doesn't work at all.<br /><br />FTP is also an issue. There are very few FTP extensions/apps available as of right now, and the one least worst one you need to pay for. It's like 2 bucks or something like that but the point is that your options are limited. And none of the FTP apps right now are really good. They're buggy, seem to disconnect randomly, sometimes don't connect at all, delete stored FTP credentials randomly, have a very limited feature set, and so forth.<br /><br />This is not a heavy productivity machine, none of the Chromebooks are at this time. For example, there's no Photoshop available for the Chrome platform, and no real alternative is available. There are some basic photo editing extensions, and they tend to be ok for cropping and minor adjustments such as brightness and contrast. But anything fancier than that isn't happening right now. Wouldn't matter because the C300, like almost all Chromebooks, just doesn't have the power for heavy photo editing.<br />Forget video editing completely, even basic cut n' export jobs. Not happening at this time.<br />This Chromebook works perfectly fine for moderate spreadsheets (via Google Docs) but it may choke on some large corporate level Excel sheets with lots of formulas.<br /><br />I was surprised how well this Chromebook handles playing HD videos on Youtube (besides the aforementioned visual quality issues due to the limited screen specs). I've not experienced any stuttering and it just doesn't seem like the machine's processor is overwhelmed playing videos, even after doing this for an hour or so straight. On a 2011 Macbook Air, the fans go absolutely nuts when playing 720p or higher videos, and it heats up quite a bit. The Chromebook stays quiet and cool. In fact, there is no fan that can kick in. This is part of the reason why performance is limited - it had to be in order to keep the processor cool and omit the fan.<br /><br />If you rely on Dropbox, note that you cannot install a Dropbox folder on this and expect it to sync with your Dropbox account like it works on Windows or OS X. Dropbox does offer an app but it's really just a shortcut to the Dropbox web site. (Some third party extensions claim they can create a virtual folder on your device and connect it to your Dropbox account but security concerns prohibit me from testing these). Google really wants you to use Google Drive. If you do, you're all set - the C300, like all Chromebooks, connects and works nicely with your Google Drive account.<br />Side note: if you see the ad here on Amazon claiming you get 100 TB of free storage from Google Drive for 2 years...that offer expired January 2015.<br /><br />Chrome OS currently cannot connect to network drives. If you use a USB thumb drive or NAS connected to your router, don't expect to be able to access any of its contents from a Chromebook, including the C300. Again, this may change by the time you read this review.<br /><br />Chromecast. If you need Chromecast, this Chromebook does the job...kind of. It doesn't always do it very well though. Videos tend to be somewhat choppy (even if they play fine on the C300's itself) when cast over to your TV. Colors look weird, not sure why that is. The machine does appear to change the look of the video somehow when it casts it to a TV. It points to a problem with the Chromecast extension itself, not necessarily the C300.<br /><br />Skype: Microsoft/Skype really needs to make a proper extension for Chrome but as of right now they haven't. If you rely on Skype, you only have one realistic option: Outlook. Install the app, and sign in with your Outlook email account. You can use a very crippled version of Skype through the Outlook email app, but there are no proper notifications, and you can't search for or add new contacts. But it's fine for basic use.<br /><br />That's the gist of it - Chromebooks are for BASIC use. This includes the C300. It's good, does the basics fine, is light, lasts a long time on battery, wakes up from sleep very fast. Its limitations come mostly from Chrome OS itself and they are the same with every Chromebook. The Asus isn't alone in having only 2 GB of memory and no backlit keyboard either. So if you get a good deal on this (under 200 bucks), and are in the market for a Chromebook anyway, absolutely get this one.<br /><br />If you need more info, go ahead and read the other reviews here, most of them are really good and spot on. I close with saying that if you haven't been using Chrome as your main browser, aren't familiar with how extensions work, and don't really know about Chrome OS limitations, do check out a few online resources about Chrome OS before you decide to buy this or any other Chromebook. I will say that those reviewers who say &#34;it's great for X&#34; may be right in regards to how THEY like to work on &#34;X&#34;, but your personal workflow and style may or may not be accommodated by Chrome OS.<br /><br />For me, the C300 is wonderful for basic browsing, emails, doing very light Word or spreadsheet work, and checking social media accounts and watching some Youtube videos.",

Note that you don't have to use  Logitech's SetPoint software to use the universal receiver.  I'll note why that's important later on.  +/-  The wave shape is a bare change from regular form factor unlike the main competitor, Microsoft's Natural (Elite), which is a full split keyboard.  The latter certainly takes more pressure off of the wrists and, if carpal tunnel syndrome or related repetitive stress injuries have troubled you in the past, you can feel the difference within minutes of typing on the Wave.  On the upside, the lack of split gives the Wave a much lower profile than the Natural series did; the Wave fits under your desk on most sliding keyboard trays where the Natural bumps most.  -2 Keys are stiff, mushy and crowded in depth.  After buying the Wave I actually came back to positive reviews here to see if I had misread them.  The key presses are terrible; there is no indication of when the press is complete and you can release for the next stroke which makes for an necessarily long key press.  Moreover, they are stiff.  A quick typist is going to be considerably delayed by this keyboard.  -2 There are no indicator lights for CAPS/NUM/Scroll/Function locks.  With SetPoint installed, toggling each status gives you a brief on-screen indicator of your change.  There are plenty of game, video card settings, multimedia players and the like which completely conflict with this indicator so you frequently have no idea what status your keys are in.  Even if you're just typing, you more often forget your various statuses.  There's no light of any kind to reference on the keyboard.  You have to experiment.  While using it for both writing and gaming alike, checking your lock statuses frequently creates breaks in concentration and this is a critical design failure.  +1 The multimedia buttons are other extra programmables in general are well placed.  However, they require the SetPoint software to really get much value from.  Without it, not all keys are matched to a standard function within Windows 7.  -2 The SetPoint software is on version 6.2 yet remains a calamity.  I've installed and uninstalled probably half of the versions over the years across every incarnation of Windows.  It forgets settings across profiles which renders them pointless, conflicts with Windows settings for mouse sensitivity, and has very limited macro capability.  My biggest complaint, which you can confirm across the Web's related trouble-shooting forums is that it will frequently cause a stutter in mouse movement.  -1 There is no backlight.  A wireless keyboard is as often as not used with a multi-media setup in a darkened room.  Not having lit keys on a non-standard layout is poor design.  Logitech mastered the feature with the K800 wireless so leaving it out of this recent incarnation of the Wave has been lazy.",

My new computer, Asus 11AD w/ Windows 7 did not come with an internal modem.  I've been using dial up ISP (Net Zero) for years, these days still d/t very complicated wiring circumstances (I'm in a crazy condo) so needed a modem exclusively to get me back into Net Zero.  This modem could not do it - never connected with Net Zero server, ever.  I spent quite a number of hours using Net Zero help and also their tech support to try to remedy situation without any success. Tech support at HiRO was great once I called, though.  Returned my call promptly (on a Sunday).  Tech basically explained that while this modem type has been tested successfully with Net Zero that many circumstances could interfere including conditions at my site or a defect in modem I received, but that, in fact, either the modem works or doesn't and time spent altering settings in windows or Dial Up ISP is not well invested.  He suggested that I either try a different manufacturer (gave me 2 recommendations) or a new modem of this same type.  I elected to go to a different manufacturer (Zoom 3095) which did work \\\\\"out of the box\\\\\" once driver CD installed.  So, even though this modem was not able to do what I wanted it to, I give it more stars as HiRo tech was truly stellar!  Quite possibly, this modem would have done it's other functions (faxing) without a hitch. It tested fine in Windows Modem Query.  PS:  This modem is a \\\\\"soft modem\\\\\", ie. most of the operating software is run from your computer, not the modem, while the Zoom has the operating software running from the modem which is why it is pricier.  Perhaps, this made a difference in my case.",

I especially appreciated the video about the product, showing exactly how to stand the Kindle up.  My only complaints are: 1 - its such a strong sturdy cover, it adds a lot of weight to the Kindle.  I have, on occasion, left the Kindle home because I was carrying other things and the weight became a factor.  2 - The cover closes, but doesn't zip up around the kindle.  In a handbag, its possible for the kindle to get scratched on the sides and there is no way to carry the cord with it.  That's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  For traveling and longterm home storage, I had an old zippered cosmetics travel case that was the right size for putting the Kindle in (with the cover on), along with the power cord, and the stylus I also bought.

A mouses accuracy, feel, and reliability is very important to me.  After about a week of constant use, I highly recommend this mouse!<br /><br />This mouse works very well and it is a great value at $14.99.  The left and right mouse click buttons are smooth and produce a nice sound in terms of volume level and tone/pitch.  The tracker ball is smooth and nearly silent.  The sides of the mouse have a smooth grip material that has a nice consistency (not too sticky, not too slippery).  The nano transceiver is nice, but seems to be a common option on portable mice.  The size of the mouse is perfect for my hands and convenient for travel.<br /><br />The biggest difference between this mouse and other mice is the laser. This mouse users a 'blue laser' technology that is extremely accurate and works on nearly any surface.  As I write this, I am using it on my couch. The couch material is microfiber and it is not smooth. The material has a bunch of ridges that are not uniform or consistent. Yet, the mouse works perfectly.  I have been using the Logitech M325 for several years now and have really enjoyed it. As of right now though, I believe the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 is superior to the Logitech M325.

That is fine as long as my both pcs are used at home, but I have to change my network setting everytime (to autodetect an IP address) whenever I have to take my PC out or if someone bring another device to my home.

I bought this D-Link DNS 323 NAS about a month ago and I love it. I ordered it with 2 [[ASIN:B001IEZX3G Western Digital 1 TB Caviar Green SATA Intellipower 32 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive WD10EADS]] drives and set them up as one disk, giving me 2TB of space. The first NAS unit I received had a faulty right drive bay (amber light came up no matter which drive I put in and both worked in the left bay), so I returned it to Amazon and they sent the replacement promptly without any hassle. The replacement NAS has been excellent since then. It is nice to be able to back up my files (I know RAID1 would be better due to the redundancy, but I don't want to sacrifice overall space) and access them from anywhere, especially my music, videos, and pictures. I got married just over a year ago and the photographer gave my wife and I digital copies of all of the photos, and the NAS makes it easy to share the full-quality images with friends and family.    The only other problem I've run into was an issue with permissions for files I had uploaded. For many of the first files I uploaded to the NAS I had difficulty in reading them again after a system reboot. I'm still not entirely sure what caused this, but after just a quick search online ([...] - this is a great site for tips on hacking and enhancing the device) I was able to set up a telnet to the machine, telnet in, and change the permissions through the Terminal on my Mac (thank God for Linux-based firmware).    One of my favorite features is the built-in bit torrent client (on the newer versions of the firmware). I am a huge Dave Matthews Band fan and I download audience recordings of the shows, so having a program on the NAS to download and seed the shows without having to keep my computer running all night has been a welcome change for me (especially since the NAS runs much more efficiently than my 5 year old laptop).    If you are looking for a good NAS system, I recommend the DNS 323 to you with no reservations, especially now that it is $110 after mail-in rebate.",

I was very underwhelmed with this thing.<br /><br />First, it should be noted that I am an admitted bibliophile. I read all the time and the purpose behind my digitalization of the book was because I got tired of lugging several books with me each time I trudged off to work. I loved the idea of having an near-limitless supply of books at my fingertips. Much in the same way that I have a 500GB Archos for transporting the majority of my music collection, I wanted something to drag around the majority of my books.<br /><br />The issues with the Kindle were immediate. I'm not going to buy everything from Amazon's eBook store and therefore needed more format support. No problem, I'm told, use Calibre. Except calibre seemed to wonk the format of every ePub book I fed through it. So I either stick with it in the hopes of future ePub support or I resolve to buy nothing but Amazon's wares (or the third option was of course to scour the seedy corners of the interwebs for bootlegged, non-DRM MOBI versions of things but that's not the way I roll if I can avoid it).<br /><br />Plus, as a technophile I like rooting, Linux-ing and otherwise voiding my warranty whenever possible. So I returned the Kindle 2 in favor of the Nook and couldn't be happier with the decision. (A fairly simple rooting took care of the one issue I had with the switch: the Nook's initial lack of a browser. Plus now I have Pandora but that's neither here nor there.)<br /><br />Let's be honest though: this is all a personal choice, isn't it? The same way I prefer Archos and you might prefer Zune.<br /><br />The Kindle does have a nice interface and the eInk screen is insanely clear and easy to read. For someone this'll be the perfect device. Just not for me.<br /><br />And for the record, Amazon was incredibly easy to deal with and fast when it came to the return process.

The form factor was sleek, and not bulky, so if you want a case that you can slide into a laptop bag or carry-on, it may interest you. I needed something a bit more hefty, but not as bulky as the more rugged/military-grade cases like the Griffin Survivor.  So, despite some negative reviews about chemical smell, I went with the SwitchEasy Canvas, which is the only A-rated iPad case from iLounge: [...]  Here's why this case stands above the rest:  - No chemical smell  - Sturdy front cover with magnetic locking (like the Apple smart-cover)  - Clear screen protector (and plastic inserts for headphone and charging ports)  - Just the right amount of bulk to give you a sense that it will survive a fall or two, but not overly bulky  - Great price for all that's included (read the iLounge review linked above)  - Solid build quality with good feel/texture  - Sturdy in stand mode (works great in your lap, unlike the Joy Factory Smart Suit, which was too wobbly in upright stand [picture frame] position).    I got the Charcoal cover, which looks great. It's not a dark charcoal, and looks really sharp on the black iPad. Very happy with this purchase.",

I am very careful with my iPad but dropped it once from the bed to my hardwood floor. The case broke at the corner. The rubberized grip if you would call it that broke at landing and the corner of my iPad got dinged. I have included a photo. So... It does not protect corners all that well in my opinion. Of course compared to griffin survivors, this product cannot compare to that type of cover. I wound up buying a different case- not a survivor but something similar and a stand to see if it's better for me. I had hoped for better protection than what I got.

My advice to potential buyers is to spend some hands-on time with the competing Apple and Android tablets and then try the new ones running Windows 8. Once you touch the Microsoft Surface you will know who the winner is.<br /><br />Windows 8 RT is super intuitive and takes about 5 minutes to learn (nobody running iOS or Android can claim that). The built-in kickstand is an absolute must (nobody else has it). The keyboard/screen cover is fantastic (nobody else has it). You can run Office on it (nobody running iOS or Android can claim that). You can attach peripherals and memory to it via a full-size USB 2.0, a HD video out port and a microSDXC card slot (a few other tablets have these features, Apple's doesn't). The build quality is superb (Apple's is comparable but most Androids are cheap junk). Every time I needed something actually useful in the app marketplace I was able to find it.

Maybe I'm asking for to much here but I think for that much money the product should work and if I have to fix your firmware fresh out of the box then you should pay me for finishing your work. At least give it an auto update ability instead of having me call tech support to find out what the problem is when you already know. I read many reviews for these adapters (after the fact)and found most people are having to send these back for replacement. Once they find one that isn't broken out of the box they are reasonably happy. Sorry, but if I'm paying this much money for a little adapter then it needs to work the first time without me having to fix or replace it. Overall quality is not acceptable. I have abandoned this idea completely and will simply add another video card to get the third monitor working and maybe a fourth.

So far I Love it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Beautiful looks! Inside and outside. Somehow the color and the texture was chosen with aesthetics in mind.<br />-The trackpad is sensetive to light touch. I prefer touch-clicking rather than tapping the button. 2-finger scroll works pretty well for webpages.<br />-BLAZING FAST ! Boot time : 20 sec to reach login screen. After login, 5sec to fully load the desktop with startup apps, bluetooth connection to speakers, wifi etc . Shutdown time - 10sec. I believe this is possible because of the solid state hard drive.<br />-No bloatwares! In my opinion , bloatwares are utter garbage and a waste of resource. For every preinstalled program, there are 10 free open source programs out there.<br />-Vizio has done a fairly classy job with there own logos, startup screens etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The trackpad does not respond well at times. It has completely frozen on a 2 occasions. That doesnt bother me too much. The way around this problem is a quick sleep-wake or several taps and clicks.. Its still a glitch<br />-I miss the Alternate Menu (Right-cick menu) key thats usually near the Right Ctrl key.<br />-The edges around the palm are kinda sharp and might bother you after long hours of use.<br />-The 128GB size of the hard drive might come and bite you one day. I have been used to a 500gb HDD for a long time. I'm already figuring out ways to put the old laptop up as a file server.<br /><br />This laptop is probably the best value-for-money in the ultrabook category.

First, the Belkin protector kit has a little cloth to gently wipe the front of the screen to get rid of dust and fingerprints. The protector itself is fairly thick, much thicker than anticipated, making for good, strong protection from scratches. The screen protector is attatched to clear plastic that you peel off and then apply the protector to the front of the Kindle Fire. Secondly, you get a little credit card sized piece of sturdy cardboard to smooth down the clear protector and get all the bubbles out. I've gotten most of them but not all, when I am reading though, I can't see them.<br /><br />All in all, good protector pack. There are 4 screen protectors with this Belkin pack.

I also take it with me on trips so I can watch movies and Hulu in my hotel room.

Everyone has to make their own choice in that area...<br /><br />As for this Samsung, I think the Amazon description doesn't quite do it justice when it comes to the measurements - 2.7 inches thickness seems really unlikely to be true, I bet that's a typo...<br /><br />The Sony SA series is less than 1 inch thick, and I think so is this Samsung.<br /><br />So, if you really need \\\\\"dramatic curves\\\\\" on your laptop, by all means, go for this one..  I guess you can tell, I'm a bit tired of all the retarded advertising texters, its insulting. Does anybody read this stuff without cringing?  Who are they writing it for? Do they think the earth's population had a collective lobotomy?<br /><br />Beyond that, I have nothing against this notebook.

Definitely louder than any membrane keyboard.  When I'm playing RPG's I'm much lighter on the keys, so I can actually play totally silently since you don't have to push the key all the way down to actuate it.  It all depends on how forceful you are when you type.  The switches are Cherry Reds which have a good linear feel to them with a lower actuation force than the Cherry Blacks.  I can still rest my fingers on they keys without actuating them, so it's a good balance.<br /><br />The keyboard is also very well made and weighs about 3.5 lbs.  It really looks and feels like a high quality product.  The enclosure/bezel has a glossy finish, so be prepared to wipe it off frequently if smudges bother you.

It would be mounted using a suction mount tablet holder suctioned to the dome light. An IR transmitter would feed the audio to IR headphones on the kiddos, leaving the adults in blissful silence! Alternatively the FM adapter can play the audio through the Excursion speakers.<br />The tablet needed to included the following:<br />1. less than $100  - technically right at $100 but within the budget.<br />2. expandable - yes it does have this capability although it is labeled TF Card. Handled a 32 GB micro SD.<br />3. 3.5mm headphone jack  - handled the IR transmitter and the FM adapter both beautifully<br />4. 10.1&#34; - the screen was large enough for kids in the back to easily view the movies. We were a little concerned with viewing angle but we didn't seem to have much issue. The tablet was mounted near the roof. The only problem came when the mount would slip and the tablet would tilt down. Otherwise the viewing angle worked very well for us.<br />5. decent battery life - we got 4 full movies at full screen brightness both going to our destination and coming home<br /><br />We didn't need a super speedy tablet but this Dragon Touch is surprisingly powerful. It did a good job loading the few apps I put on and surfing web, facebook etc. It seems to be a pretty powerful tablet. We are pleased with it. It came with a screen protector already put on and it does have a few bubbles. But that's very minor in the grand scheme.",

Now for the reason I'm posting a review, since the above is not exactly ground-breaking:  I have arthritis in my left wrist due to a fracture I sustained several years ago.  It makes holding a print book open quite painful.  Reading had been one of my favorite activities but I all but gave it up 8 years ago when I broke my wrist.  The Kindle is, for me, a miracle.  It's given me back the ability to read.  Since I bought it, I've done almost nothing but read.  I understand that many, if not most, like the look, feel and even the smell of print books, but for the small minority of us who can't effectively use print books, the Kindle is a godsend.  That may be a good thing to keep in mind as a present for a loved one who suffers form arthritis or a similar challenge.",

But @ $107 I thought it was steeply priced, I didn't need a backlit keyboard, it didn't put the iPad in portrait mode, the power cord was so short I had to charge my iPad on the floor or remove it to charge the keyboard and the manual left much to be desired. So I searched Amazon.com for an alternative and it seemed like this product was the right solution. Alas it almost, but isn't. Because you can read so many glowing other reviews, I'll just state what I find lacking.<br /><br />1.  Don't let the stock photo fool you that accompanies my review; you CANNOT use your iPad without retrieving the arm from the base. Trying to put the iPad at a decent viewing angle otherwise upends the keyboard causing it to tip up.<br />2.  Retrieving the arm from the base is an exercise in delicacy and agility. The way I found to do it is: (a) put the iPad to sleep; (b) grab the button the locks/unlocks the arm at the base of the hinge; (c) while holding this slider button with one thumb, pull the slider with your other hand. It takes some effort.<br />3. Putting your iPad into portrait mode also requires effort. You'll have to repeat (2) to slide the arm all the way out, rotate your iPad; and place it in the groove on the keyboard table.<br />4.  If you want to take the iPad out of the arm and use it as a tablet, that works OK, but restoring it is a bit awkward. Again, it's best to put the iPad to sleep before removing and restoring it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm too embarrassed to return this item and re-buy the Zagg after I returned it, and then return the AirBender 2.0. Also, I expect that, assuming its a sturdy unit, I'll adjust to its quirks and use it just fine. After all, the keyboard is better and it has many features I want. For example, the Zagg doesn't have cutouts for the iPad's 2 microphones, the AirBender 2.0 does. Great for recording your instructor in class. Works for me.",

I came to Amazon to buy another because I like it so much. When I wasn't sure of the manufacturer, I dug it out of the trash. Grandtec is the manufacturer. I started thinking heck its in the trash let me take a further look at this, I can't make it worse. Come to find out, the cord was pulled out of the socket inside. I cut a little slit in the silicon and plug it back in, Now its works again. But this one doesn't Illuminate. So I will be buying the newer version here.",

The TPM's  nine switches have two positions but can't be programmed to have two functions ( ie one for each physical switch position), and because they send commands that are interpreted as if they are coming from another Saitek device (in my case even with the Proflight Throttle Quadrant disconnected), they are really useless. Saitek support is pretty useless as well.

It's bright orange, so I may not forget and leave it behind as I clean up my equipment and leave fire camp.  Of course the color and styling also scream \\\\\"LaCie\\\\\" to any passers-by but that's not important is it ;).

In my case, installation was smooth and product registration easy.  You can also choose to reformat the drive, lose the software and run with a straight-up external lettered drive.  I kept the software to test the whole package.  When I buy the less costly/bottom line dollar drive products, the software included on them gives users less choice in installation.

This vanishes when I turn the page, and will pop up again at random times. This never happens indoors. So my advice is: do not use it in direct sunlight. Indirect sun is fine. I believe the product will wear out rapidly in direct sunlight.<br /><br />My main concern: as a student pursuing a PhD, I was thinking I would use this for organizing my PDFs, and generally making the PhD process more streamlined. Yes, you can put your PDFs into the Kindle document folder easily enough. The problem is, that PDFs cannot be highlighted, unless you go through any number of 'fixes' found on Internet blogs. I have tried them all, and all of them fall short in various ways. OCR, Mobipocket Creator, Calibre, MS Word and every iteration of those in tandem/mixed/jury rigged...<br /><br />Solution for now: NOOK Study app for students (FREE) can only be used on my PC. However, it does everything I need it to do as a student: Highlights, organizes, I can open multiple books at once, PLUS: I can drag and drop a PDF into the interface, and it automatically transforms into a useful mark-able format that is perfect, just like having a book to mark up. This is the main need for my study habits.<br /><br />The downside to the NOOK Study app, is that the Kindle is far easier on the eyes. I can read for hours without eyestrain, and this is why I will keep it for some of my research (books that are already in Kindle format). However, if I make the brightness of my computer screen dimmed, it can approximate the look of Kindle e-ink to a large degree.<br /><br />So for now, I will keep both DX and NOOK Study app. This is a hassle, but I suspect that both companies (Barnes and Noble and Amazon) will make these devices more user applicable as time goes on.<br /><br />Oh, one thing I love about the DX: listening to books while working out, I can also read while doing a treadmill. I listen to books while driving too! Listen in the dark while falling asleep. Love that. One design flaw here: the volume level goes from zero to a little louder than I like. This can be solved by loosely inserting ear-buds, although I would think the volume control could be more sensitive.  The battery will wear down much faster when using ear-buds, so keep that in mind.

They're well made; no argument there. They just happen to be rather noisy.  Fix:  1. Buy some paracord. Easily found on Amazon or Google.  2. Remove the metal grab tabs that attach to the zipper (just the part you would pull on, not the part that actually zips). I used wire cutters of a decent build, because these are hefty pieces of metal.  3. Attach the knot of your choice. I used blood knots, because they're fast, easy, and solid.  Done: No more jingle jangle.  Synopsis: Great pack, but noisy. Easily fixed by replacing the pulls with knots. The zippers are excellent, so you shouldn't think this is a downside. They're metal on metal, and that gets noisy, but 10 minutes of your time is all it takes to swap the pulls to knots. If you want to add reflection you can always use reflective paracord, so that vehicles will spot you more easily.  End note: Easily fits a 17.3\\\\\", books, pens, small umbrella, water bottle, notepads, extra battery and power supply for the notebook, and whatever else you're willing to lug along. I carry about 20 lbs in it normally, which feels very light with this pack. I would expect it could lug 40 lbs or more without difficulty, and the straps would still ease the load well. This is a good uni commuter bag for those with a large load.",

I called Samsung support and in many different sessions we tried installing updates, wiping the hard drive, and other techniques that did not work.  They finally admitted it was a hardware issue and said I would need to send it in for repairs that would take up to 15 business days to complete.  I explained it was defective from day one and I can't be without a computer for over three weeks and that I would need a replacement sent or sometype of loaner.  They were unwilling to honor that request. I asked to speak with a supervisor, was placed on hold for 20 minutes.  I was then told the supervisor was talking to someone else but would call me back at the first opportunity.  I received a call about 18 hours later, but only after my wife tweeted to Samsung on their lack of follow through.  The supervisor said she had no ability to override their standard policy but someone from the exeuctive team would call me back within 2 business days.  As you could guess this call came well past two days in the form of a brief voice mail that said we revieded your case and we will not accomdate you.  No attempt to speak with me.  I can understand a repair if I had the laptop for a while, but not working brand new....not the experience I have had with other companies.  It is a shame because it is a nics machine and would have been perfect for me if it work ad advertised.<br /><br />Since Samsung is resolving a known issue and had so little respect for its clients needs or time I would strongly recommend a differnet ultrabook.",

Only works in USB 3.0 ports, and each part has to be on its own USB BUS. If both the throttle and stick are both plugged in to the same USB BUS, via a multi plug device or a hub plugged into a USB 3.0 port, button presses randomly get sent fairly frequently. Probably a driver issue.)<br />- I've had the throttle randomly lose power while playing. It doesn't disconnect from the PC (windows still sees it), but the lights go off and none of the buttons work. This is an issue when you're maneuvering to dock and the throttle and thrusters get stuck on. I've never leaped around to the back of my computer to unplug and plug it back in so quickly! (which fixes the issue) This issue is pretty rare, but it's very problematic when it does happen.

It has to be configured with an IP address, which is ridiculous because the wired router connection is normally plug and play.  However, no amount of configuration in the xbox dashboard would allow the xbox to connect wirelessly.  This was even with the assistance of tech support, which is spotty at best.  The folks are nice enough, but getting through can take a very long time.  I'm okay with networks - all of my other stuff works great - but definitely not an expert, and I could go on and on about the changes I made.  I won't, though.  If you prefer painless set-up it's probably best to match brands when designing a wireless network.  I'll give D-link the benefit of the doubt and admit I was using a router of a different brand, but with all of the configuration options on both ends, this should not matter.  Oh, and I read some of the earlier reviews and I agree that this thing runs real hot.  Who knows what that'll do for the product's longevity because I don't plan to keep it.

The wake/sleep feature works flawlessly, and I had no problem accessing  any of the ports and buttons on my Mini. I would recommend it, definitely.",

Don't pay attention to the other reviews saying that the bass is to loud because their wrong the bass is right on the money. The speaker design is so sexy that beautiful circle speaker in the middle of the speakers is very unique no other speaker system have I seen with that design in the middle of there speakers. The sound coming from these speakers is so crystal clear and kick ass; I'm listening to freestyle right now and bumping my head to the sweet sounds this system lets out. Bar none my favorite speaker system to date & the sub woofer is so cool and lets out mega sweet bass jams yeah. The cables are all long so you will have enough to reach every part of anything you want to hook up the system to and boy does it make the room vibrate and look sexy just watching it do its business and pump those jams out hardcore style yeah. It's a must buy wireless speaker system for your TV or laptop if your economy shopping like I was this is the babe to pick up. 5 out of 5 stars all the way for the Creative Labs A220 2.1 Wireless Multimedia Speaker System with Subwoofer a kick ass little guy to make your neighbors squirm and your parents yell turn down that racket and make you feel like a renegade again yeah.",

It works both when connecting to your USB 3.0 port directly on the motherboard and also thru a USB 3.0 hub. I also found the transfer speeds to be limited by the type of drive connected but performance was as expected.

Best of all, if i need the keyboard for easy typing, i dont need it attached to the IPAD at all. You really get to appreciate the multifunctional role this little device gives you after some time. The shortcut keys on the keypad are great and help access the internet and control your music, photos or videos. The ability to tilt the IPAD or even change the orientation from landscape to portrait is easy, so when you play that video you forgot to record in landscape, just a twist and your watching it right side up. Two additional features allowing you to remove the Ipad from the hinge is great when you dont need the keyboard or removing the IPAD with the hinge attached from the keyboard allowing you to place the IPAD further away but still allowing you to control/type away is an added bonus.

Even with 32GB capacity, I seldom transfer files larger than a few hundred MB and I had no problem with the few extra seconds I may have had to wait as compared with higher speed USB 3.<br /><br />The novelty of the waterproof skin is definitely novel.  To test it out, I copied some files to the drive then submerged it in a glass of water for about 15 minutes.  I took it out and dried it off and was able to use the drive fine on my computer.  (That said, my son had a cheap 1 GB thumb disk go through the washing machine a few months ago and it worked fine afterwards as well...as long as the internal circuitry is protected, you're usually going to be fine).<br /><br />The rubber skin made the disk bulkier in my pocket and gave it added traction when pulling it out of pockets, backpacks, etc.  Not a problem, just an observation.  I'm not sure if it adds any &#34;strength&#34; or &#34;ruggedness&#34; to the disk (beyond just waterproofing) but the disk felt sturdy enough.<br /><br />It has a nice hole for stringing it onto a lanyard/necklace/bracelet/strap/whatever.<br /><br />The standard retail price is maybe a little high for the USB2 transfer speed and the capacity but the average sale price is about on target with other products.<br /><br />Overall it's definitely an adequate USB Drive for your pocket sized storage needs.

The case can easily be setup and will quickly connect to the iPad.  It only took me around 3 minutes to remove it from the packaging, hook up the power cable to ensure it has enough power to connect, then sync the bluetooth.  Pretty great in that regard.  I gave it another +1 for the keyboard.  The keyboard is not quite a full keyboard, but it is as close as I have ever got with a bluetooth case.  Also the keys gave good feed back, and had good finger feel.  So we are now at 5 stars.  I did give it -1 star for the fact that the plastic enclosure and slide out stand did not feel durable.  I mean kid durable.  It would probably work well for a business commuter or student, but not great for the home user with kids.  Since the iPad is largely a media consumption device I had to take one star off.

Of course now when you think of bytes for hard drives and certain files, it's nothing but what it is--BYTES-- Well that was the day I learned about flash drives and how important they can be, especially if you are limited on your hard drive space.  Ever since I have tried different FLASH DRIVES, but I really like the Cruzer the best. It's space designed, lightweight, can be used with one hand and most important it's very reliable with a cost friendly price. I keep several on hand just in case my hard drive crashes or maybe I want to download something to it instead of my hard drive. Keeping your information stored and logged can be a time saver when something goes wrong with your system. I know there are other ways to back up information, sometimes you just might want to carry it around in your pocket and with some backup devices that would be hard to do.It's amazing that something so small can hold so much information.  So my thinking is this---If you are just beginning to learn about computers and want additional storage without having to update your computer then get yourself some of these. They go much higher in bytes than this one, but for me this is just right for now.",

Network performance marks are up across the board. Part of the attraction to the N600's is the out of the box DD-WRT firmware/factory support. I setup my AP's with tagged VLAN interfaces to distribute my WiFi network via copper (saving the bandwidth that would be consumed by traditional WDS). I use 2.4Ghz for better range/penetration and 5Ghz for closer range/faster throughput scenarios. I believe these are also MIMO 2+2.<br /><br />Are there even more capable router/AP's on the market today? You bet.

I have a Logitech G400, for reference, but I'm confident that no mouse will have a problem with the QcK.<br />-Excellent quality.<br />-The material feels good to the touch, with a slight texture. It is thin enough to lay flat on your desk without any noticeable raise.<br />-The logo is not obtrusive at all. It doesn't detract from the attractiveness of my computer setup.<br />-Perfect size, although this is a subjective opinion. I recommend that you draw out the size of the mousepad onto a piece of paper (12.6 in x 10.6 in) to get a good perspective of how big it is.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-It attracts fur like crazy. I have two cats that love to walk all over my desk, and pieces of fur end up on the mousepad each time. It's a little difficult to brush the fur off with your hands, but a damp paper towel works fantastically.<br /><br />The mousepad is the highest quality I've ever used -- better than the numerous aluminum and foam mousepads that I've burned through. I recommend the QcK fully. It would be great as a personal purchase or as a gift to a PC gamer or any computer user in general.",

The first thing to do when you get it is carefully stretch the handle and REMOVE it! The shell attaches to the Asus with four very small tabs. Since the Asus is a somewhat heavy tablet for it's size, using the handle just means you're stressing those attach points and just asking for the shell to detach and for the tablet to fall out - it's as simple as that. My handle came off easily and as someone else noted the handle attach points do make for a slight elevation of the keyboard which is nice. I would just like to add that there is very little if any &#34;protection&#34; offered by this shell, the weak attach points mean that it'll fly off if you drop the tablet, so if you're aware of that limitation then go for it. I bought mine just so that I wouldn't have to constantly wipe-down the tablet after use from fingerprints and I liked the color it added better than the slate grey that the tablet ships with.

At the current setting, the cursor moves too quickly, so I often overshoot my destination.

I bought my ST31000333AS over a year ago, use it in an external Vantec case with firewire connection. Blazing speed, never a problem. Note that if you buy the drive alone you don't get rails, disc, anything but the drive itself. If you want a kit with all the cables, etc, then go for that and pay more. I was using Western Digital HD's for years, finally gave up after the n-th one died. Been using the Seagate Barracuda line exclusively for several years now, 300GB, 400GB, 1TB. No complaints. They run so quiet you don't know they're there. Highly recommended.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/10/17: I had to respond when I saw comments from 2010. I purchased one of these drives in Dec. 2009. It's now 2017. It's still running -- though it's getting noisy sometimes. That's high-tech talk for &#34;nearing the end of its life.&#34; 8 years. Not bad. I've had good experiences with Seagate drives for 20 years. I've got ones that have been running virtually non-stop for 3,4,5+ years. Have I ever had one die? Yes.

            "input": "This review is for the Dell Venue Pro 11 (model 5130) with the Atom Z3770 (aka BayTrail) 2.4 GHz (Windows: 1.46 Ghz) CPU, 2GB RAM (Windows: 1.88GB usable), 64 GB SSD (Windows: 50.3GB usable, 14GB used (includes recovery partition), 36GB remaining), and Windows 8.1. The review also includes the Slim Dell Tablet Keyboard (does not have a secondary battery), but not the Dell Active Stylus.<br /><br />Background: I am in the IT field, but don't consider myself a guru on the hardware or software side. I do use Windows 7 at work, Windows Phone, and iPad Air. I feel this is important for you to know, since what I use on a daily basis shows what I'm comfortable and familiar with. An active digitizer by Synaptics initially caught my eye too, but as the reviews from DVP8 users started coming in, turns out (so far at least) to be a false positive, the recent software update seems to only make it slightly better, it is Synaptics first generation attempt so it looks like major teething troubles (in fact, between December 2013 up to now, February 2014, Dell has stopped selling it).<br /><br />Packaging: I will mention the packaging because US carriers are known to drop and sometimes throw packages, so it's important for electronics. Both tablet and keyboard came double-boxed (box within a box), providing good insulation from shocks, though curiously the keyboard's box was almost twice as big as the tablet's. Excellent job Dell on the packaging, I don't think it could have been any better.<br /><br />PROS:<br /> - good performance/battery balance: from complete power off to login is about 12 seconds, sleep to wake is almost instantaneous, and orientation change takes about two seconds. Passmark scores show 538.2 overall and CPU mark of 1358. Internet Explorer, Skype, and other apps load responsively, you never get a sense that it's slow, although I haven't multi-tasked too much with it yet. Official battery life is about 8-9 hours, for my general/light usage, seems to live up to that. Heavier continuous usage with wifi I see about 4-5 hours. Battery life on standby/sleep seems to drain about 1% every hour, so you're looking at about 3 or so days of standby time. Text-based reference programs (x86) are no problem for this machine, and MS Word 2013 loads to blank document in about 4 seconds. I would guess heavier programs like full Photoshop would struggle.<br /> - 10.8-inch screen indoors: bright indoors, most of the time I have the brightness set to 38%. At 1080 HD (1920 x 1080), text and pictures look sharp, and viewing angles are excellent. Touch responsiveness has also been accurate except the virtual keyboard.<br /> - size/features balance: officially weighing at 1.57 lbs without the slim keyboard and a fan-less design, pretty happy with what they squeezed in physically for that weight: 10.8-inch 1080 HD screen, full USB 3.0 port separate from the charger-USB port, mini-HDMI out, and micro-SD card slot. The full USB has been convenient, being able to instantly plug in mouse, backup drive, and external CD/DVD drive.<br /> - full Microsoft Office Home and Student edition: this means full editions of Word, Excel, Note, and Powerpoint with an activation key. I don't think the i-Core(i3,i5) versions of this tablet come with this<br /> - full Windows 8.1: whatever is lacking in the Microsoft Store, I usually can find a free, powerful version for full Windows. Example: Sound recorder, the standard Microsoft touch app is very basic, with no control on the quality, format, or save location. With full Windows, there is Audacity. Same thing with encryption software - TrueCrypt, or PDF viewer/annotator called PDF-Exchange (this one is not free though), and so on and so on. With the power and productivity of desktop-class programs, the fact that this machine can run both (touch apps and desktop) to me is a large advantage<br /> - consistent and decent-range wifi performance: thankfully have not experienced the wifi issues plaguing some DVP8 devices<br /> - removable battery: I can't think of any tablet that has this (the battery is rated at 4220 mAH). I like this not so much that I would have multiple batteries, but that if the tablet is still alive and useful after several years and the battery starts to fade, I could easily replace it without surgery<br /> - reasonable price considering all of the above pros<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br /> - camera: 2MP front facing, Skype video renders relatively sharp and clear, the rear camera at 8MP is just ok, typical for mobile devices - with enough natural light (outdoors), pictures come out nice and sharp, indoor pictures not as a nice - white balance not that natural, blur and high noise from medium to low light (flash would have been nice). Compared to iPad Air in indoor medium/low light, the iPad Air pictures come out better, meaning more natural/detailed and less grainy.<br /> - graphics: Games like Reckless Racing take about 17 seconds to load to start screen, Asphalt 7 takes about 7 seconds, Reckless Racing is relatively smooth but can get jittery, Asphalt 7 bogs down to about 10-15 fps and barely playable. Passmark shows 2D mark of 194.7, and only 2.36 for DX11 and 48.6 for DirectCompute. You'll have to do some research on how this measures up to your requirements, it is nice how you can play full-fledged PC games on this tablet if the graphics can keep up, but I don't care too much about games, you might.<br /> - speakers: the speakers are stereo and there's one on each side of the tablet (along the shorter sides) about 2cm long, but they sound tiny, at medium volume voices sound thin and can distort. The iPad Air speakers are in a different league and have a fuller bass than the Dell, but for general usage and with low expectations for a device of this size, it is ok<br /> - windows capacitive button: I heard DVP8 users complaining they don't have it, but I find I can accidentally press it and wake up the tablet from sleep, I wish it only worked after the tablet iswoken up by the power button. The capacitive button is in the middle of the long side opposite of the power button, and by default it provides haptic feedback on press. By pressing it, you go to the start of the metro view, touch it again and it switches to desktop view<br /> - virtual keyboard: like with other Windows users, I'm experiencing repeating letters using the virtual keyboard, even though the press itself is accurate/deliberate/careful, making the typing experience frustrating. Adjusting the settings in Windows does not seem to help. My Windows Phone does not have this issue, and this is probably more a Windows thing than Dell, which is why this in the NEUTRAL section<br /> - add-on slim keyboard: pricey, although maybe reasonable compared to iPad's smart case. Magnets work well in keeping it attached and the cover on, even when upside down. But curiously the keys are hard/smooth plastic, which does raise concern about screen contact and scratches. I would prefer the keys to have a rubbery coating and back-lighting similar to Microsoft Surface keyboards. Key travel is minimal (1-2mm) but allows fingers to rest on the keyboard, something you can't do with touch keyboards, and the \\\\\"precision\\\\\" track pad, although small in size, is very accurate and responsive. Unfortunately, both the keys and touchpad are not fully sealed, so it raises the possibility of debris getting in and jamming the keys. Lap typing is not a good experience because the keyboard flexes so much, to the point where any key can all too easily press down due to flex pressure. The keyboard experience on a flat hard surface is optimal and almost required. The keyboard has a built-in deactivation feature, where if it swings past ~190 or ~70 degrees, it will deactivate, which is a great idea. The keyboard has come quirks - disabled auto-orientation (locked landscape orientation), and disabled virtual keyboard when the keyboard is swung back. These can be major drawbacks when you think about it- eg. PDF viewing/editing in portrait mode with the keyboard swung back, trying to keep the orientation in portrait, trying to find the virtual keyboard when using touch apps, etc. is an exercise in frustration. Microsoft Surface (regular and pro versions) do not have these drawbacks, so if seamless operation while the keyboard is attached is important, this is something to consider. A representative from Dell in the support forums says the engineers are looking into this.<br /><br />CONS:<br /> - NEW UPDATE February 2014: un-usable rear camera: using the standard Windows Camera app to take pictures with the rear camera sometimes does not work, instead you just get a gray screen. I know physically the rear camera is not broken because strangely the video and panorama modes work. When the camera sometimes does work, it eventually causes the tablet to freeze or shut-down (crash) that day or the next. Apparently, other 5130 users in the Dell support forums are experiencing the same issue, and BIOS A05 does not fix this.<br /> - quirky stability/bugs: search the Dell Windows mobile forums for all the bugs and stability issues one might encounter. I've experienced the Windows camera app freezing/crashing the system, battery not charging, auto-brightness being too dim, touchpad being slow on wakeup, random freezing, random shutdowns, etc. These are not dealbreakers for me, they are annoyances that mostly have workarounds and hopefully will improve over time with firmware updates. Hopefully.<br /> - 10.8-inch screen outdoors: outdoors the screen is very reflective, also noticeable indoors depending on the light-source and angle. There doesn't seem to be any anti-glare baked into the glass, like with Nokia's ClearBlack and Assertive Display Technology. Add-on solution: 3M anti-glare matte screen protector sold from Dell, does a nice job in diffusing glare hitting the screen, but also diffuses the screen sharpness going the way. A built-in solution is preferrable since therewouldn't be this sharpness/anti-glare tradeoff<br /> - no built-in GPS (although Bluetooth or USB receivers are an add-on possibility, I prefer a built-in option and not have anything sticking out)<br /> - no hardware orientation lock, but you can through the software in about 4 steps<br /> - no camera flash. To be fair, not too many tablets have this either, including iPad, but why not?<br /> - no physical covers for exposed slots: I'm not sure of the long-term consequences of this, and I understand most laptops do not cover their ports either, but as a tablet that goes everywhere, I am a little concerned of debris going into the exposed ports. The only port covered is the micro-SD.<br /><br />Tips:<br /> - if you see a subtle screen flicker, try the \\\\\"Intel HD Graphics Control Panel\\\\\". Inside this program, there are two settings: Panel Self Refresh, and Display Power Saving Technology, by turning both off, the flicker went away for me<br /> - to install x86 programs from CD, either use ImgBurn or similar utility to create and mount an ISO file, or just buy a cheap USB CD/DVD drive<br /> - be aware that Windows has two levels of lock screens - screen lock and account lock, and both have different settings configured in different locations<br /> - if the screen seems dim, in desktop mode, click on the battery icon in the task bar, then click on \\\\\"more power options\\\\\", then click on \\\\\"change plan settings\\\\\", and then click on \\\\\"change advanced power settings\\\\\". Expand \\\\\"Display\\\\\", and turn OFF Dimmed brightness and Adaptive brightness.<br /> - if you're having trouble with the SDXC card, even if it's brand new, it could be the quality of the card. I purchased a new generic 64GB card and had problems with file and copy corruptions from the start, and formatting to NTFS, FAT32, and back to exFAT did not help. Eventually returned the card, and spent more for the SanDisk brand, which worked flawlessly. In hindsight, saving a few dollars for the cheaper card was not worth the hassle.<br /><br />Dell sales/service: No Dell product review would be complete without the usual mention of Dell's abysmal sales/service, which seems to be consistently rude across the board, and sometimes (ok, many times) I find them hard to understand, it doesn't help that they get impatient or just hang up on you. I find with my colleagues that have used Dell products, as long as you can stay away from actually talking with someone, or if the request/problem is relatively simple, the experience tends to be better. One commenter said she got better experience going through Dell's small business channel.<br /><br />Overall: NEW UPDATE February 2014 - overall rating now drops from 4 to 3 stars due to the un-usable rear camera. Overall a decent tablet as long as you can work with the bugs. Dell seems to be aware of and working on some of them, so hopefully things will improve soon. On the OS front, Windows needs some improvement too, looks like some good changes are coming to Windows 8.1 Update 1 and eventually Windows 9. In the meantime, especially on the touch side (live tiles and apps), there could be some frustrations, for example, closing an app by swiping from top to bottom and holding for a few seconds (try that in portrait orientation on this screen) is a drastic step back from the infinitely easier red X of the desktop. This is just one of many examples of possible irritations you might encounter, and combined with the almost un-usable touch keyboard, if touch interaction and refinement is a priority, would lean the review to lower ratings.",

Seriously?!?<br /><br />I've tried repeatedly to use the online player but it doesn't work.  This needs to get fixed.  Being able to share Pencasts is an important feature.  The fact that it doesn't work is a \\\\\"deal breaker\\\\\" in that I can't whole-heartedly recommend the product.  Livescribe get this fixed ASAP!<br /><br />If that feature gets \\\\\"fixed\\\\\" I would give this product a much higher rating.  It is easy to use.  Helps with my lecture notes.  It would be phenomenal if it had the ability to OCR formulas, but I realize this is difficult.  However, there is an iPad app that does it...hint hint hint....<br /><br />UPDATE (7/28/2014)<br />I've had this pen since May and have some reflections to share:<br /><br />First, the IR sensor which tracks the pens movement gave out.  Livescribe has been very quick and responsive about replacing the unit.  If your pen starts missing strokes when you write, make sure it isn't lag and then check in with Livescribe.  There is a knowledge base article that shows you how to check to see if you are having IR issues.<br /><br />Second,  while in general I really like the pen and have found it to be very useful, I'm not sure the Livescribe 3 was the right choice for me.  I want to share my thoughts so to make it an easier choice for other consumers.  I am a student and I use the pen to record notes/lectures.  Lectures run anywhere from 50-75 minutes or so.  This makes my pen casts very long.<br /><br />I also want to be able to share the pencasts with other students.  Herein lies the problem.  The Livescribe 3 pen, which runs on iOS, requires that users who don't have an iOS device (which includes me when I want to replay casts on my MacBook Pro) use the online Player.  My files which are > 10M don't play on this and in fact Livescribe recommended that I record 1page at a time.  I haven't tried this yet to see if it works, but I'm not sure I want to be thinking \\\\\"Is this a good time to start a new recording?\\\\\" when I'm in class.<br /><br />If you use the Echo (USB transfer) or Sky (Wifi transfer), this is not a problem as the player is part of the desktop app.  Therefore, if you are a student who wants to record pen casts to share with students who may or may not have iOS devices, I recommend going with one of the other models (and from what I've read of wifi model, I might stick with the Echo.<br /><br />I'm still not increasing the stars to 4, until I get the IR issues straightened out.  But I'm hopeful that in a few months I will be able to increase the star rating on this.  It has a bunch of potential and I'd really like to see the product succeed!<br /><br />Customer service has been great and very helpful!",

Once you connect this device to your computer via the FireWire cable it is seen as a standard FireWire device and is treated just as if you had connected your modern camcorder to the computer. Within your video editing program you capture video just as you would normally, except that instead of the capture program being able to control playback you will need to manually start the playback on your source device (VHS VCR, 8mm camcorder, etc.).     Connecting the unit is easy. Simply plug your analog source into the standard RCA ports (or use optional S-video for the video portion) and then connect the fireWire cable between the device and your computer. Optionally you can connect things in reverse and use the FireWire as the source with the converter changing your digital video into analog (I guess if you want to output your digital video to an older TV). I have not used the device this way.    My main use for the ADVC110 is to import lots of old VHS and 8mm tapes that I had recorded throughout the years into my computer. From there I am simply archiving the video files to external hard drives. This is great because now I can easily review tons of records straight from my computer with instant access instead of searching for tapes, rewinding them, etc. The video files are standard DV format and take up about 13GB of disk space per hour.    So far I have imported about 100 hours of video with this device and it has worked flawlessly!    There are two things that the ADVC110 did not come with that I had to purchase separately: An AC power adapter and a 4-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable. This may not apply to you if you are using a Mac computer or a desktop Windows computer, but for my Lenovo laptop they were required. Why? Since my laptop only has a 4-pin FireWire port I had to buy the 4-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable (Canopus includes other cables in the box, but not this particular one). The problem is that 4-pin FireWire cables do not provide power to the device, so you then need to connect an AC power adapter to the ADVC110 in order for it to turn on. Once you have this setup and working everything is fine, but you should be aware that you need these two extra items if you will be using a 4-pin FireWire port. Also be advised that the AC adapter is quite expensive for what it is (search Amazon to see).    All in all this is a fantastic device if you are serious about capturing high quality video from analog sources.",

It's certainly the only one where the light is powered by the Kindle battery and that's the whole point of it I think.  It locks your Kindle in nice and tight (it's not going to fall out on it's own) and looks very smart.  It is not poor quality like some other reviews suggest. It is very well made and looks quite streamlined and upmarket.  I guess as with anything, the leather may show some scuffing in time. A leather protectant or periodic polishing may help if you can be bothered. If you want something crazy robust, look for another cover.  The light swings out to illuminate the text adequately and it's neat how it's built-in and powered off the Kindle battery.  I guess it does make the Kindle a fair bit heavier but nothing unmanageable and it would be better if there was a strap or a magnetic closure to keep the front flap shut. If you're concerned about this, it would be a cinch to make a strap to go around it out of elastic.  I went for black, just couldn't commit to a colour sight unseen.  My only real gripe is that Amazon would not ship direct to Australia so I had to use a parcel-forwarding service (highly recommend boxvoyage.com) and literally the day before the cover arrived, I received an email from Amazon saying they now ship Kindle Touch and it's accessories to Australia. Bummer.  I think most people would find this cover fits the bill.",

If you are planning on using this mouse from time to time, its a great option, I'm sure under normal usage just traveling or in meetings it would stand up quite well to the task, however under heavy usage... choose something else. The responsiveness of the mouse and the ease of moving it were great, as I said I used it for PC gaming as a cheap laptop alternative to using my Bluetooth Logitech MX1000 mouse which is too laggy for gaming.",

So far, all other software and hardware has worked fine in Vista 64 (most importantly, my old games).      I haven't run into any issues yet, just the typical bloatware that was installed on the PC by gateway. One other annoyance with the scroll function on the mousepad. The right area is dedicated to the scroll function, and it's not quite as responsive as I'd like, but so far, that's my only complaint about this laptop (one that I'll not have to deal with once I get a compatible USB mouse).     I have played both Titan Quest and Age of Empires 3, with the detail cranked all the way up, and while I had to dial back a couple of the settings, the laptop has performed admirably well.

The other thing is I almost always have the audio &#34;headphone&#34; jack plugged into my home stereo, and I am startled by a loud buzz when the book goes to sleep or turns on, or at other times (it happens fairly frequently) and is really unsettling. And I guess a third thing is I do have to limit the number of tabs (pages) open, or I get the &#34;he's dead Jim&#34; message. On the whole though, I'm very happy with it. I use it to read, often when it isn't plugged in, and the battery life seems fine.

But in October I finally got down to saying right, time to get one. So I was pretty sure that I was going to get a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 32gb but I couldn't find a 32gb on amazon that didn't come with a bundle of some kind. Which might be great for you but the offer I saw I didn't like. Then the other 32gbs were Tab 2s.  And the Galaxy Note 32gb was too expensive and I didn't want to spend that much or need all of the processor. In fact I could only find the Tab 3 16gb for 399 and it went on sale for 299. So I had resigned myself to that. Then I found the Asus MeMO Pad FHD 10.1 32GB and it was priced at 299 on sale for Black Friday. It had the same chip and the 16gb Samsung tab 3, but double the ram and the storage. So it started to become a no-brainer. It had the removable SD storage, dual cameras, a Micro USB port and a Micro HDMI. And that pretty much sold it. I checked out some online reviews and the machine seemed like it would be fine and it is. It's my first tablet, and it does what I expected it to do, browse the internet, play a youtube video, connect to the cloud and allow me to read a book. I have not tried to play a movie yet but I don't expect that will be an issue. The speakers are great, clear and loud, good sound. The apps all work especially the ones I wanted. I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say that patience in waiting for Black Friday, waiting for android 4.2, doing a lot of reading and reviewer research really helped me to make a decision on this tablet.

The computer is awesome, it really is, but after using it for about 5 hours I got a BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH (BSOD), I updated the nVidia drivers and that was the end of that error. About 3 hours later it started FREEZING constantly, but the temp was ok and I had not too many programs open. Everytime it freezed I had to turn it off pressing the on button for like 5 seconds, then it turned on fine... The freezing became more constant and I couldn't even use it for 10 minutes straight, then it came the WORST, It doesn't even turn on now, just gives me a black screen and that's it. One time it turned on fine and I managed to update the BIOS with the latest version, it did it ok, when I restarted the computer I got on the BIOS information and in fact it was the version I updated it to. It turned on fine, got on windows, 5 minutes later it FREEZED AGAIN, that was the last time it worked... I called Asus, they gave me a RMA and I'm going to send it back to get it fixed, however I don't live in the USA and I'm here for vacations only, after they send it back I'm gonna have to pay like 150$ to get it send to Venezuela and that's not on Asus...    Good luck with yours, but give it a try and search \\\\\"Asus freezes\\\\\" or \\\\\"G51JX freezes\\\\\" on Google before buying, that might help you reconsider...    EDIT: My New 5 star review would be after this: I contacted Amazon and in one day I got a replacement laptop for the one that was bad. The one I received worked great... Great Laptop for real!    Pros: Awesome Machine, Graphical Applications like Autodesk Maya 2010 and Unreal Development Kit works like a charm. Everything you would expect from such machine.

The modem was easy to connect to existing cables.  However, I had to make a direct connection to the data source in order to provision properly.  Eventually, I used the online Comcast capability to provision and once completed, both Internet data and telephone data were readily available.  It's a bit costly, but will save over time.",

I've never had the battery run low, I charge the keyboard as often as the iPad, every 1-3 days.  The keyboard actual feels better as time goes by, since I get more and more accustomed to the feel of the keys. I would recommend this!<br /><br />*****************************************************<br /><br />Initial review:<br /><br />The keyboard paired easily with my 1st Gen iPad, within 2-3 seconds. Previously used primarily as a media device for music and movies, I will now be adding a touch of productivity to the device.  Within the first hour, I found myself reviewing productivity apps to view and edit Office files.  And with 4 different corporate emails from 4 different companies, this will make keeping up with emails MUCH easier.<br /><br />Imagine getting this much use from a 4-year old original iPad...!<br /><br />The value in this purchase lies in the LOW discounted price,,, $22, if it was priced at it's original cost of $69, I would agree with other reviewers and purchase another item.  It's seems well-made, but also inexpensive-made.  Only time will tell how reliable this will end up being, but at $22... there is no doubt about it's value.",

I've been looking for the right book to inspire me to read for enjoyment again and instead of a book to inspire me it was the Kindle.  It peaked me interest so I started researching e-readers and found that I didn't want a stepped down version of an iPad,iTouch,iPhone, or small laptop, all of which I own.  All the other e-readers out there seemed to be some sort of version of the aforementioned.  I also didn't want anything that reminded me of reading on a computer screen. I wanted something that's only real function is dedicated to the written word.  I decided on the Kindle for that reason and after downloading all kinds of free classics I found myself excited in the books I purchased as well.  I'm finally reading for enjoyment again.      The pages on the Kindle looked so much better by far than any other e-reader I looked at (which is basically most of the e-readers on the market today).  The words on the Kindle seemed to pop off the page without looking like it was a computer screen.  All the other e-readers seemed like it was on a computer screen.  The battery life as stated far surpasses the competition as well and so far it hasn't disappointed me on that claim either.  My friend has a Nook and needs to recharge his battery at least once a week.  I can go multiple weeks without charging my Kindle.  I also bought the leather companion case with LED light in the corner and couldn't be happier with that purchase as well.      Maybe because I can carry a variety of books with me all at once now and have many options is what rejuvenated my spirit.  Either way I couldn't be happier with my Kindle because I have finally found a way to get me a way from the Internet, TV, and other distractions for a little while each day.  I never thought the day would come when I would start reading for fun again... That day has finally come.",

The earpods aren't like the normal plastic but a velvet like cloth material that does a good job of being comfortable and canceling out noise around you so you can hear your team or chat without outside noises interfering.  The swivel earpods are nice for storing them and if wrapped can easily keep your cord from getting entangled.  You can turn on or off the mic by a switch on the earpod.  Right under that is a volume button to control the sound.  I don't play online games on PC much but when I do I like to keep the mic off until I need to use it so this makes it a little hard for quick on and off function without messing up the game, but if you play with the mic on all the time then this will not be a problem.  The cable is sturdy and solid and should hold up.  The sound is good especially with the velvet like ear gaurds they really help keep the sound in and the outside sound from interfering with your game.  I watched a movie on them also just to see how well they could be used as earphones and I was pleased makes the movie loud and crisp and keeps outside noise out.  Will be using these for both movies and when I play online.  One last thing I will note because in the past most PC headsets say only PC but will hook up to the PS3 I tried them on Xbox and PS3.  I tried to hook them up and as most headsets will configure to the PS3 this one would not so this is strictly a PC headset.",

Often times, this battery would overheat and swell, making it difficult to remove from the socket. After only a few months of use (normally on the charger because of the low capacity), it now continues to charge even after the computers say it is at 100%, and the laptop immediately loses power if the charger is removed.

I can't drill holes or anything, so I feed it upstairs and it's working great.<br /><br />So I recommend this cable and $%#%# wireless. PEACE!",

Can be placed on keyboard with no issues. Just a warning, they toss in a screen protector, I wish I didn't waste my time with it. It was not easy to apply and looked like crap afterwards.

Technically, for normal USB 2.0 use, a port cannot supply more than 2.5 watts (5 VDC nominal x 500 mA), a number that barely works for the iPhone series. Thus, no matter how much power I provided through the power input connector for a powered USB hub with seven connectors, the individual USB port circuitry limited it to something that would not charge any of the iDevices. That right: NONE of them.<br /><br />Enter the XMultiple connectors. These connectors apparently use the little-known specification for \\\\\"charging only\\\\\" USB service. This provides up to 9 watts (5 VDC x 1800 mA) of power by placing a 200 ohm resistor across the D+ and D- pins. (Thanks to Wikipedia for finally making this clear to me.)<br /><br />The end result is that all of my devices now charge simultaneously off the dedicated multiport powered hub. Power to the hub is supplied through a 12VDC battery source (our off-grid house battery bank) running through a heat-sinked 12V-5VDC regulated voltage converter, which never even gets warm.<br /><br />There's nothing out there that is commercially available yet to charge multiple devices, but this workaround does the trick. I bought four of the connectors at once. They're well built, match Apple's USB cords very nicely, and simply put, they all work.",

The Chalkee did seem to jump in some small areas, but that was due to some food or other residue on the screen. It worked fine when the residue was cleaned up.<br /><br />A little pricey at $15 (a couple of free apps can justify this cost!), but worth it for all the time saved in cleanup and laundry!<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Good product dimensions enable ease-of-use even for dainty toddlers<br />* Stylus works!

There is a lot of hating on Acer that goes on on-line, and I thought, how can a laptop be that bad? It's got the same Intel processor and Microsoft software as all the others, why not get this one that is so much less expensive and does all I want?<br /><br />In the interest of fairness, I will say, I wanted so much to love this laptop. It was lightweight, had the cool 360 degree thing all the way to tablet mode, and the touch screen is absolutely the way to go with Windows 8. The problem was that it didn't work, and in subtle ways at first. The laptop was always unresponsive when booting up. It was necessary to hit enter or whatever key several times before getting to the login screen. Then, when switching to tent or tablet mode, the touch screen would become wonky - only letting me type in caps, opening a million new browser windows, or not working at all. Each time this happened, returning to normal laptop mode did not correct the issue, and a restart was required. So after a few days of this, I exchanged the laptop at another location (which was easy to do because I was well within my 15-day return policy period) for a new one - same type. The new one worked okay for about 5 weeks. I say &#34;okay&#34; and not &#34;great&#34; because there were still little issues - the unresponsive keyboard at startup, the &#34;g&#34; key not working properly after a couple of weeks, the issue where I couldn't connect to my wireless router when I returned home from being connected at work and had to reboot to make the computer connect. Finally, these little issues were overshadowed by the touchscreen ceasing to work at all. I had not really been trying to use it in other modes - turns out it's an awfully big tablet and not very appealing to use in that manner - but in simple laptop mode, it would work and then itwouldn't. When it didn't, the driver would disappear completely from the device manager. A chat with Acer support had me update my bios, which made things better for a couple of days, but then back to the nonworking touchscreen and the disappearing driver. Acer support chat had me do a factory reset (be prepared to give up a day to back up your data and then do the reset), and after that, the driver didn't load with the Windows software. After updates, it did load, but then there were the same issues in tablet and tent mode as with the first laptop. They told me I would have to mail it in (with at least a 3-week wait time) for repair.<br /><br />I went back to the box store (that I believe this model is specifically made for), despite being well past the 15-day return period, and since I had already been in for a touch screen issue, they let me exchange the machine for an entirely different laptop. There's also a lot of hating on the internet for this particular store, but I can only say nice things about their customer service. Anyhow, two laptops both with touchscreen issues, purchased in two different states, no less, indicates that that is an issue with this particular model. Add in the wireless connectivity issues, the flimsy keyboard, and the slow boot, and it's clear that this is not a well-made computer.",

This change happened at the beginning of March 2011. The NextBook NO LONGER shows YouTube videos because the NextBook does not support Flash. This might change at a later date, but as of March 2011 you cannot watch YouTube videos on NextBook anymore.",

It is definitely the most functional and also attractive case I have seen for the Kindle Fire. The rotating feature is priceless and ingenious-it allows you to use your Kindle in landscape and portrait view without having to detach anything or maneuver the case in awkward ways. It also has 3 different slots so you can prop up the Kindle for hands-free viewing from all angles. The case also allows you to lay it flat on a surface or fold the front flap back completely so you can just hold it comfortably in your hand. In terms of appearance, the leather is high quality and the microfiber/microsuede interior is incredibly soft. The color is also a beautiful light aqua. Viewing it on the computer does not do it justice! I also love the magnetic closure and the fact that the interior prevents the screen from becoming scratched. I cannot say enough about the functionality and beauty of this case. I have absolutely no complaints! BUY THIS CASE!! You will be so pleased!",

I prefer to use the keyboard's volume control keys. When closed, the clamshell provides protection all around. I'm not sure how much impact it would absorb, but the plastic feels sturdy. A semi-soft rubbery clasp locks the shell closed. When open, it sticks out below the spacebar.<br /><br />Something to note: The top photo in the Amazon listing shows the older model. This upgraded case has proper openings for the iPad Air 2\u2019s dual mics.<br /><br />The keyboard synced easily with my device. It's very comfortable to use. The keys are responsive without being overly sensitive. The subtle click of the keys is reassuring to those of us who like tactile feedback.<br /><br />As a teacher, I roam around the classroom with my device. One feature I'm excited about is the ability to detach from the keyboard without removing the protective shell. The two halves do not need to be connected to use the wireless keyboard.<br /><br />Probably the biggest selling point for the Airbender 3.0 case is the infinite viewing angles. It takes two hands to slide the metal arm out of the back of the case, feels a bit awkward, but it's well worth doing. The hinge is reassuringly stiff and holds the angle perfectly. The upper shell pivots 360 degrees without restriction. My previous keyboard case had one viewing angle in landscape only. That case cost nearly one hundred dollars! It will be gathering dust in the back of a desk drawer.<br /><br />New Trent could make one improvement\u2026 Color variety! I would like sour apple green please!",

I have only one issue with the card reader... the SD slot works only once per computer one/off cycle. After that, I either have to reboot the computer, or unplug the card reader and replug it in for each time I insert a SD card. When I sent Lexar an email explaining the situation, they told me to \\\\\"zap the P-ram\\\\\". No problem doing that, and it worked again... once. Then, the same issue. I sent Lexar a follow-up and got no response from them.   Don't get me wrong, this is a very fast card reader, and I really enjoy it. I just wish:  1. I didn't have to go through the hassle of unpluging it and re-pluging it in each time I use it.  2. I wish Lexar would have sent me a new one to see if that was the issue. Or, at least maintained dialogue with me.",

The kindle camera takes pretty good pictures. It doesn't hold a charge as long as my kindle does. That could be because she sometimes leaves it running. While having a year free subscription to FreeTime is totally awesome (it really is) the fact that she can click on multiple apps at one time uses up the kindle memory.

The weakness of this laptop drop on the small button of PgUp, PgDn. I do not feel comfortable to work with these buttons and hope the Lenovo company can make changes in future models of thinkpad. The display resolution is not so high to compare with other multimedia laptop like Dell XPS or TOSHIBA L755. However, this laptop is ideal for people who works at the office and mobile travel. The anti shock features of the HDD protection or anti-liquid through out the keyboard are plus marks. In my point of views, in comparison between price and performance, this gear can be rated as the good choice for students and official who do not need extra values like gaming or video editing.

Sadly, it's harder with a Mini, especially when I want to touch up a document or tap out an email.<br /><br />I ordered this keyboard as a way to do just that.  It fits very well and I have to say, even though I've had issues with wireless keyboards in the past, this one was reliable for me.  However, and this is a big caveat, the dimensions of the keyboard are still pretty small.  I know it has to be compact to fit with the form factor of the Mini, but it's still a little difficult for me to type on it.  Doing regular typing was out for me, so instead I resorted to finger-thumb style typing.  It works, but I'm not sure carrying around the extra bulk of the case is worth it.<br /><br />That all said, the product is great quality.  The keys, though Chicklet style, are enough to give you positive feedback when you're typing.  It also does double duty as a stand, so if you want to place your Mini on a table and watch something, there you go.<br /><br />This is a good product if you simply *must* have a keyboard that fits the footprint of the iPad Mini.

The CR-R supplied with the burner failed to work, prompting a call to HP.  I was getting the &quot;high speed media&quot; error and not too happy about it.  With the technician's help (we all agree they need an 800 number) this was solved by simply going into &quot;options&quot; and telling it to NOT perform a write speed test.  Then we set the write speed at 1X.  It seemed to work, but I was having quite a few disks fail during burning, so I called back.  This time checking the system performance was done and the whole turning off all startup menu programs.  But I would not deal with a product that forced me to turn off my antivirus software and decided that if it took this much trouble, I would return the 8230.  I have since discovered that if I simply reboot my system prior to burning, even with all startup items intact, that I have no problems burning either data or audio CD's.  You may say this is not ideal, but I find it to be a small inconvenience for a sure thing, instead of a possible coaster.<br />Yes, it is slow, but I don't need speed and am totally uncomfortable with installing anything on my computer.  Since updating to &quot;Record Now&quot; software, I have not turned off the write speed test or checked the write speed, but have not had trouble with data CD's and I think my son has been burning audios.

But I would echo what others have said: Only after installing the newer drivers from Happauge's Web site. Upon initial install, the unit offered only herky-jerky, unwatchable video. The new driver took care of that.     Since I live in an area with no direct OTA digital or sd tv channels, I'm using it exclusively with a DirecTV basic satellite box. So I can't speak to the efficacy of the tuner, or, for that matter, the remote control, which is superflous to me because I simply tune channels with my sat box. But it does provide smooth, pretty sharp SD TV to my Dell Latitude 2.2 gig dual core with 8 gigs ram and 256 MB ATI video card.    Note that to hook up the unit with a satellite box, your box needs a video out (such as S-video) and audio out jacks to feed into the card. Note also that this card will NOT give you HD channels through a sat box, as it has no HDMI or composite inputs. But I didn't expect that for the price, and HD TV in a small screen window seems sort of a waste.     The WinTV app is a little annoying, but it works OK. I tried to set up this card through Windows Media Center, but the setup wizard would hang everytime it tried to link the tuner to a Media Center remote, and I don't have a Media Center remote. Dumb, with no workaround apparent. The software does recognize the tuner, however, for those of you who do have the full whiz-bang Media Center setup.    Also, the audio from the card through my onboard PC audio system is excellent. Overall, I'm pleased that I can junk my clunky old office TV for fifty bucks or so.",

That really is a huge letdown since it basically forces me to take the nexus out of the case when I want to use it for more then checking the clock :( pls fix it<br /><br />2. The front cover,when folded back is not even and puts the nexus in an awkward angle when placed on a table or holding in hand. I understand that this might be due to how thick thick the cover is,but I wish this could be differently.<br /><br />The 2nd point isn't why I give 3 stars,it really is the 1st point.

I tried using the adapter of my wife's Samsung NC10 netbook but I it seems like its not charging my laptop properly when you are using it at the same time (flickering red and green light). So I decided to shop around for a replacement adapter. I first checked the Samsung website and found the AA-PA1N90W which costs $79.99. Then I checked Amazon and found this adapter for only $24.90. I asked my friend if it's ok to use a non-factory issued adapter. I was afraid that a non-factory issued adapter will do some damage on your battery. He told me that usually if you buy a warranty from Best Buy for parts replacement (Geek Squad?), they will just replace your defective adapter with a generic one. I decided to try this one because of the big difference in the cost. It's been a month now since I first use this product and I don't have any complains. It's been able to do what it is suppose to do which is charging my laptop.",

Under heavy graphics load it does run a little warm, but no where near some of the other laptops I have had and used in the past.  My only complaint about the laptop is the internal sound card started cutting in and out.  I have an external sound card and it works perfectly.  I have read on Toshiba's website that it is a common problem for this model to have.  It started doing it after about a year and a half after purchase (after the warranty expired, of course.)

Now I'm connecting an Amazon Fire TV Stick and having similar problems.  Switching the Fire TV Stick over to my new wifi access point also (a separate physical router), almost all of my problems have gone away with these devices and their connectivity.<br /><br />One possible problem here is that I'm connecting these devices to my 'guest' Wifi.  I should explain here that the N600 has the ability to separate a primary wifi network from a secondary guest network--in my case, I use the primary to enable connections to my NAS, so the guest wifi cannot access my secure files.<br /><br />Overall, I've spent enough time trying to forgive this device, because I wanted to like it.

I have yet to edit video on the system but my first tests indicate it is very capable of this task and I edit full HD Blu-ray quality video at 1920 by 1080 resolution which is native to this laptop.     So far the system has been equal or above the performance of my AMD Quad 3.2 GHz desktop system (which is expected from an i7 chip vs the AMD)  I was disappointed that the Raid 0 did not make the drives in this system faster. And the drive speed is the rate limiter on the Microsoft performance rating. I assume this would be a great system after swapping out the two drives for solid state or hybrid drives.  I can't comment on its gaming power but I assume since it does well on music and video tasks it should also perform well for gamers...   Bottom line: Really good powerful system lots of features, excellent keyboard which can handle audio and video tasks with ease at a really really good price point.",

It does miss a keystroke here and there but it's really nothing you can't deal with. I'll update this later with battery performance updates but as of right now eveything seems to be working pretty well.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 was because it took over 2 weeks to get to me.

Pros:  -Sandybridge CPU, very fast and snappy.  -G520M with optimus. I love this technology, as it saves a lot of battery. You can choose what program to use with the discrete or integrated video card. I've only tested counter-strike source and I got up to 150fps, ranging around 50-70 average on High settings!  -Keyboard looks very nice and clean and feels good to type on  -Not too heavy, something you can carry around with you.  -Build of the laptop is very good, wish they would put the same material thats on the palm rest to the case. (Oil resistance)  -Battery life is VERY good! So far I get around 8 hours (Surfing, Gaming, Install programs, Movies, Brightness at 30-40%)  -Touchpad is good, but clicker attracts oil!!  -Nice and quiet, no vents on bottom, doesn't get burning hot.      Cons:  -Speakers are very dull. No clarity at all, nor its loud. I can live with it but would prefer to have headphones on.  -Resolution is at 1366x768, but it looks fine on at 13\\\\\" laptop. Viewing angles arent great and can't really see outdoor.  -Finger print magnet on the cover.  -Webcam could be better.  -No USB 3.0  -Not 7200RPM HDD like advertised  -ASUS BLOATWARE      So far I'm satisfied with my purchase, battery life is good, moderate gaming when needed, sandy bridge, build is nice and its not too heavy. I plan to use this laptop for some business work/ personal entertainment. If you can deal with the cons, this laptop is for you!",

Right after getting it, I tried to switch to this from my old Bamboo, but I eventually gave up in disgust. Unfortunately I never got around to sending it back. I found it in a box today and decided to try again-- still no dice. I've installed/uninstalled the drivers and software several times, but while it all seems to install correctly, the minute I plug the tablet in, the light blinks for a second or two, then goes out, and it sits there like an awkward paperweight. Luckily I've moved past the extreme frustration I first experienced; I'm just so tired of messing with it. Otherwise I'd probably lob it out of the window.<br /><br />But for anyone considering buying this, I'd definitely advise you make sure you can spare the money just in case it ends up being a waste. I've heard of it working perfectly fine for some people, so hopefully it'll work for you. But after a glance through the negative reviews I can see I'm not the only one who can't get it to work at all. And it seems other people get it to work only for it to die within a few weeks.

Dragon Age II looks amazing at full resolution with the High Def textures installed and can be played 2D or 3D at a very nice frame rate. The HD add on pack makes this game look absolutely beautiful!    Mafia II looks amazing and runs very well in 3D and 2D.    Call of Duty: Black Ops also runs excellent with all settings turned up in both 2D and 3D.     I plan to test GTA:IV, Arkham Asylum and a few other games soon and will post how the card performs with them.  All in all, it's an amazing piece of hardware. If you want to upgrade to NVIDIA 3D vision in the future you cant go wrong with this card, if not, you also cant go wrong with it.    The card runs about 63-68 C at high loads on my system.

Full cycle including a high-speed spin dry in a front-load washer. I figured it was a goner after I found it, but I let it dry for a few days and then tried it out (with an old SD card that held no data of any value). It works! It's a bit scuffed and smells a bit like Tide, but it still reads and writes just fine. The manufacturer makes no claims about water resistance, and certainly nothing about being washer-safe, but this little guy can take a punch. The cap didn't even come off in the wash!<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this SD card reader. It's very nicely built - feels solid and able to hold up to getting bounced around a bit in my travel bag. Good quality plastic with rounded edges so you don't stab yourself when you carry it in a pocket. I especially like that the cap over the USB port fits tightly so it won't come off unless you want it to. Granted, I'll still probably lose the cap in a few weeks as I usually do, but until then it does the job of protecting the port very well.<br /><br />There are two side-load slots for SD cards (one for regular, one for micro SD cards).<br /><br />Installation was non-eventful. Just pluged it in and in a few seconds Windows recognized it. I used it on XP (SP3), Win 7 32 bit and Win 7 64 bit machines without any problems. Although it is a USB 3.0 device it works just fine on a USB 2.0 port.<br /><br />The speed is excellent. I timed copying a directory of 400+ jpgs with the following results (the camera was a Panasonic Lumix; the same SD card was used for all):<br /><br />Direct connect the camera to the PC = 1 min 39 seconds<br />Reader built into my monitor = 1 min 21 seconds<br />Pixelflash reader = 44 seconds<br /><br />Excellent speed, good construction quality, simple installation.

Many reviews stated that Linux worked great out of the box. The stock Broadcom BCM4306 worked great with Win XP, but failed at the Linux distros. I didn't want to use ndiswrapper, fw cutter, fuss with command lines, etc. Broadcom cards have been a problem with Linux. I have another laptop using an Intel 4965 card, which connects to Linux out of the box. My thought was that there was better Intel support/drivers built in the Linux kernels.<br /><br />I purchased several Intel 2200bg cards in a package at an unbelievable price with the intention of selling the extras.<br /><br />Installing the card was super easy. After shutting down the laptop, removing the battery, loosening 2 screws, removing the small back cover, popping off the antenna wires, releasing 2 latches and popping out the Broadcom card, then installing the Intel card and doing everything in reverse, I was ready to go. It took all of a minute or so to replace the card.<br /><br />I excitedly booted up the computer and tried out several linux distros and later Win XP.<br /><br />Puppy Linux was a flop. The card was recognized, but it took several attempts to get a connection. I have a couple other desktops and use USB wireless dongles on both, and Puppy/Ubuntu/Mint connect effortlessly. Not with this card. Then, onto Ubuntu 10.04. No luck. My wireless network was recognized, but after typing in the wireless key, no joy. Finally, Linux Mint 11.04. Of all the distros, this connected to the wireless decently, but the connection did drop and I had to reconnect. I did not have this problem with my wireless USB's on my desktops. Overall, my experience with Linux was disappointing.<br /><br />Next, I tried out Win XP Pro. I downloaded the latest driver from the Intel website, and installed it. Originally, I used Network Magic as my wireless utility. I could not get a connection. I uninstalled Network Magic and used the native Windows wireless zero configuration utility to connect. It worked a little better, but it took a couple minutes to connect. However, the connection was inconsistent, and there are dropped connections. Sometimes, when I put the laptop to sleep and wake it, I cannot get the card to reconnect.<br /><br />I tried several cards to make sure that I wasn't using a faulty card.<br /><br />Finally, I replaced the Intel card with the original Broadcom card, and then booted up Win XP. Right away, I got a connection within 10 seconds. The connection has been rock solid. The Broadcom is excellent for Win XP on this laptop.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with this card. For linux, I will use a wireless dongle for this laptop despite my preference for a mini PCI card.",

Saitek quality is very good and the yoke and throttle quadrant work fine, although it was much more difficult to use than expected. There is no manual supplied with the equipment that is useful and the manual for the SST programming software is useless.  I have another Saitek input device, the x52 fighter stick and throttle which have been in use for a few years along with Saitek drivers and their SST programming software. Being somewhat concerned that I would have a conflict with the older system when I installed the new yoke (they would be used for different sim software and not at the same time) I attempted to contact Saitek tech support as shown on their website. The phone was never answered, the email server was constantly having \\\\\"connection issues\\\\\" and the \\\\\"official forum\\\\\" is closed to new registrations. Support is presumably provided by Mad Catz something or other.  Installing the new software provided with the yoke was a disaster. None of the profiles developed using the other version were recognized, the new software is much more difficult to use, one reason being that none of the button assignment numbers in the software templates match anything provided by Saitek, so you have to guess. I finally managed to create a profile for Flight Simulator 2004 but the program refused to use any of the commands. It also broke my other stick so I had very basic use of that. I wound up removing all the new software and drivers and reinstalling the older version for my fighter stick and got that working again. I then had to manually assign commands within FS 2004 for the yoke and throttle and have that working, but without the programming capability due to the older software not being aware of the newer yoke.  I would buy this product again, but just aware that you are on your own with faulty software and non-existent support from the manufacturer.    As an update, after a week of frustration trying to get this to work correctly and getting no useful information via support email I have returned the unit to Amazon. The throttle quadrant refused to work in FS2004 and I could not get one button on the yoke to program. In addition, doing a calibration within FS would reprogram the entire unit with commands from some source I could not track down.",

I wanted an alternative (read cheaper) solution than Apple's Airport Base Station.<br />The iMac came with an Airport card pre-installed and has since been upgraded to Airport 2 in OS X.  I also recently acquired a Lucent Technologies Orinoco (formerly Wavelan) Silver PC Card from Agere Systems, which offers 64-bit WEP for my Powerbook.<br />The most challenging aspect of setting up the WEP security is getting it to work on each hardware device.  I'll explain the three steps it will take to get the above configurations working.  We're still using Macs, so it's relatively painless once you know how.  The steps below assumes you're familiar with the wireless aspects of your hardware and that you're not yet using or haven't figured out how to enable WEP using your SMC router.<br />Step 1 for the router: Access your SMC router via your web browser on any Mac using a hardwire Ethernet connection and click on the last link in the left pane, &quot;Wireless&quot;.  In the main window, under Wireless Setting, select a name for your wireless router in the space next to Network ID(SSID).  The next item, Channel, can be left alone.  The item after that is where you set your WEP Security.  In my case, since the PC Card in my Powerbook uses 64-bit WEP encryption, I chose the &quot;Enable IEEE 64 bit Shared Key security&quot; option for the router.  Now choose &quot;WEP Key 1&quot; and enter a Hexadecimal string of 10 characters (you can only use the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f).  I try to come up with a nifty pass phrase to help me remember the string, which may prove challenging using hex.  In our example, let's use decade2010.  Save your changes and reboot the router.<br />Step 2 for the iMac: In either OS 9 or X, invoke the Airport Setup Assistant.  The assistant should detect your SMC wireless router now.  In OS X, you'll get an Enter Network Password dialog box where you'll need to enter the hexadecimal string you came up with in Step 1.  But in order for it to work, you have to enter a dollar sign ($) before the string.  In our example, the network password that will work with your Apple branded Airport card and the SMC router is: $decade2010<br />Step 3 for the Powerbook: Open the ORiNOCO control panel and click on the Encryption tab.  Click on the Enable Encryption check box and next to Key 1: enter a zero (0) and the letter &quot;x&quot; before the string in Step 1.  This lets the Wavelan card know you'll be transmitting using a hexadecimal string.  In our example, Key 1 will look like this: 0xdecade2010 (don't forget to set the &quot;Transmit using&quot; to use Key 1 and then click on Set to save your changes).  If you click back to the Basic tab, you should see Closed Network for Network:, and your router's name for Net Name: which you set up in Step 1.<br />This setup works flawlessly for me and I highly recommend this non-Apple branded hardware.<br />The SMC wireless router has a printer server port and a serial port if you want to add your old 56K modem to it. This is good if you have broadband and it goes down. I've only tested this scenario and I pray to the Wireless Goddess that I never need to invoke it!  It also bridges AppleTalk, which is awesome for printing to old laser printers that have Ethernet, but don't support TCP/IP and for easy file sharing.  The USB Printer Sharing in OS 9 works great too.<br />The Lucent wireless PC Card is actually an Apple Airport card, but Lucent of course adds the antenna. This card is compatible with any Powerbook with a PCMCIA slot in it (even the 5300 and 190 series!) using Mac OS 7.5.2 and greater.<br />And best of all, SMC and Lucent support Mac users while many other non-Apple wireless hardware vendors do not.<br />Have fun in the wireless zone!<br />- Jarrodr Network Password dialog box where you'll need to enter the hexadecimal string you came up with in Step 1.  But in order for it to work, you have to enter a dollar sign ($) before the string.

If you click back to the Basic tab, you should see Closed Network for Network:, and your router's name for Net Name: which you set up in Step 1.<br />This setup works flawlessly for me and I highly recommend this non-Apple branded hardware.<br />The SMC wireless router has a printer server port and a serial port if you want to add your old 56K modem to it. This is good if you have broadband and it goes down. I've only tested this scenario and I pray to the Wireless Goddess that I never need to invoke it!  It also bridges AppleTalk, which is awesome for printing to old laser printers that have Ethernet, but don't support TCP/IP and for easy file sharing.  The USB Printer Sharing in OS 9 works great too.<br />The Lucent wireless PC Card is actually an Apple Airport card, but Lucent of course adds the antenna. This card is compatible with any Powerbook with a PCMCIA slot in it (even the 5300 and 190 series!) using Mac OS 7.5.2 and greater.<br />And best of all, SMC and Lucent support Mac users while many other non-Apple wireless hardware vendors do not.<br />Have fun in the wireless zone!<br />- Jarrod",

I could not scroll through on-line pull-down menus, Hulu+ play stuttered and jerked in full screen mode, and even the operating system would not allow me to scroll through some lists of programs, files, etc.  Online research yielded varied results:  some people had re-installed their computer from scratch, others had purchased new mice, Kensington's in particular.  So, I ordered the Kensington wireless mobile with the nano receiver and I called HP help.  When the tech got on my computer by remote, since even he had the same difficulties with the features same as I did, I began to think it couldn't possibly be the mouse, and was wondering if I should even open it.  My current mouse was a Logitech laptop mouse with a nano receiver.  I did the system recovery myself and might have saved myself the time, because, although improved very mildly, the same problems continued to occur and get gradually worse again.  So, when the Kensington mouse arrived the day after, I was very curious to see what would happen.  Lo and behold, the Kensington mouse \\\\\"healed\\\\\" my notebook!  Amazed, I experimented.  As soon as I pull the Logitech nano receiver out of the port, and put in the Kensington, everything, and I mean everything, that didn't work, works perfectly!  As soon as the Logitech nano receiver goes in, problems!  Not all is lost with the Logitech however, it works great as a game mouse.  I just have to remember to take the receiver out as soon as play ends.  Now I think the problems began when I installed an HP game, but even after uninstalling it, the problems remained, probably because as with so many uninstalls, stuff gets left on or alterations made remain.  Anyway, the best part of all this is that I find the Kensington to be an EXCELLENT mouse in its own right; a very functional and stylish mouse, it fits my hand well and it is VERY portable.  Plus, it has a great feature in that it turns itself off after not being in use for about 10-15 minutes, saving on battery drain!  I thought I would be a little mad to have paid a few dollars more for it, but not at all! I LOVE this mouse and will buy Kensington again and again!  Definitely worth every penny and I recommend!",

The back screw hole is lined up flush with the heatsink blades, meaning you have to push the screwdriver against the heatsink.

What is of most interest probably is that it is an exact replacement for the Toshiba Satellite C675 S7200 laptop supply.  By changing the connector I was able to use one to power a Samson S amp (head phone amplifier) after the power company destroyed the original wall wart.<br /><br />Finally, I use two to power a very fussy prototype scientific amplifier-synchronous rectifier that measures very low currents around 0.0000000000001 Amps.  If something needs 19.5 volts regulated DC at less than 3.5 Amps, try this power supply first before considering something much more expensive.  Device to be powered should have filter capacitors as this supply is well regulated but is not fully filtered.<br /><br />The second and third units were purchased in 2013.<br /><br />Despite being made in China, they seem well built and don't get overly warm at near full load and are stable at a 35 milliamp load as well.<br /><br />These run very well on a simulated sine wave inverter.  Input power to the 12 volt inverter is less than two watts when the supply has no load, less than one watt for the inverter and likewise for the HQRP supply.  Overall 12 volt to 120 volt to 19.5 volt conversion loss is around 15 % on average.  Some other power supplies do not function well on simulated sine waves,  making this a vital piece of my power backup kit.  Ideal for solar power apps.",

There are these TINY tabs that the flap rests under to keep it in the proper position to watch a movie - unfortunety, any little slight bump and the flap slips out from the tabs and the iPad falls flat.  This is a serious flaw that needs to be addressed.  I still face it 3 stars because I liked the material and I especially liked the clear back cover (so my gold ipad showed through) - i also liked the rubber corner bumpers - in fact the iPad is surrounded by rubber - seemed very well protected from drops - but not being able to securely prop up the iPad to watch movies is a deal breaker for me and i will be returning.

Once I decided I wanted something solely dedicated to reading and not just a tablet to read books/comics/ etc on I then went and investigate and compared this product to Nooks Glow light reader.<br />*why this over just getting a kindle/nook app on your ipad/surface/etc?: battery life is the biggest reason. read more than 30 minutes at a time? You will love this. Want to read at any time under any light with zero issues? grab this or the nook glow light. You have the best of all worlds. My product has been on for nearly 2 weeks and it has only gone down in energy by 20 percent. The percent is an estimate (this will lead to a negative they have to fix). It is super light and super inexpensive and I can read in the bright light. I keep it on airplane mode unless I am downloading a book. No other reason to leave the wifi on.<br />You can google all the different articles comparing this and the nook eglow reader and they are all very true. The nook only glows and doesnt offer you different levels of glowing. I can't tell you how often I have needed a certain percent glow vs just a general glow. Also, the feel and look of the nook eglow is cheap and awful. It really makes a difference.<br />Negatives: very few but they do and should be fixed. There is no percent battery charge left button or way to find out. Sorry but we all need to know how much percent we have so we can figure out when we need to charge.<br />They do need to restate or reverse what they say with the light. it says to turn the light all the way down in the dark. Ummm I tried that and i can't see it! I understand it is suggesting you don't turn it all the way up so you get eye strain. just reverse what it says and make it easy or just say 'adjust to brightness needed but not too bright to avoid eye strain'.<br />Great product, great price and wonderful experience.",

            "input": "This is my first Fire, so please bear in mind that I cannot contrast/compare to the Kindle Fire (traditional). I have numerous other Kindle e-readers, and work with numerous other Android and Apple tablets on a regular basis.<br /><br />First impressions - when it arrived today, it looked very sleek. Well-packaged, easy-to-open (unlike reports of the Nexus 7). No power plug, but I have it charging as I write this using a standard USB charging kit. Please note that if you plan on charging this device, you will (preferably) need a USB power adapter that supplies a full 2 Amps of current (or better). Otherwise, the unit will take forever to charge. And by forever, you can just check the FireHD's site out - 13 hours. Yeah. More than all night. No thanks. :) I personally believe that not including such an adapter was a wise cost-cutting move on Amazon's part... many of us already have a 2A charging adapter from other tablets/etc, and it cut $10 off the cost of the unit (or $20, if you didn't buy Amazon's special charger when you ordered the FireHD). By the way, my particular FireHD came charged to 68%.<br /><br />The size is perfect - it's got a good, solid feel, as well. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to let you know it's not a toy. The back is a nicely-textured matte finish. I don't like larger tablets that much, since it obviates one of the major advantages of a tablet in the first place (mobility). At iPad/Transformer sizes, I start to wonder why the person didn't just have a Netbook or regular laptop.<br /><br />Setup: The FireHD comes, as all first-bought Kindles should, pre-registered to your Amazon.com account. After power-on, the device asks for a wireless network, a timezone, and (optionally) Facebook/Twitter integration. That's it. Then it gets to the carousel/shelf interface and is instantly linked to your account's purchases. All my latest books, music, and videos were there, even those purchased earlier today, along with a Kindle Fire Welcome Guide. The device automatically updated itself after the first sleep I put it in.<br /><br />Incidentally, before the device arrived, I had pre-registered to remove the ads, for $15. From what I have heard on other Kindles, the ads are actually not very invasive or annoying, and actually can help pay for the Kindle over time through reduced prices or coupon offers. Me, I prefer an uncluttered and un-advertised-to interface, so I opted out. I think it was absolutely excellent of Amazon to offer this option in response to those who wanted out of that, but I would have been fine with them being there if there was no option to turn them off.<br /><br />Screen: The screen is gorgeous. Here, Amazon has learned from its competitors, who on their tablets used an application where the LCD panel is laminated/applied directly to the back of the cover glass. This allows the FireHD to have a clear, crisp screen no matter what the viewing angle. When I first powered the unit on, I cringed for a few seconds because it felt like the screen was too small - like I would feel cramped. This, however, was absolutely not the case, once the Kindle was active and into all the content, it was very open and inviting. I can only imagine how big the 8.9\\\\\" would be!<br /><br />In terms of usability for the touch-like nature of the display, this is the best tablet thus far I have ever used. Even light presses register properly. Many other tablets I've used are very particular about how hard you need to press or linger before registering. And yet, even with the \\\\\"hyper-sensitivity\\\\\" this device has, I have yet to have it register anything false (wrong button pushes), which are another hallmark of other tablets. Bravo, Amazon.<br /><br />Apps: The fire comes pre-loaded with OfficeSuite (a free version of a larger suite for editing documents), the Silk web browser, a Calendar, and various other supporting apps for things like Email, Contacts, IMDB, and Help. I like that they kept the initial load relatively free of bloatware (MOTOROLA: TAKE A HINT PLEASE!!!). I personally do not like the lack of some applications on the Amazon App Store... for instance, I would have liked to load Firefox or Chrome, but they are not there. Also, a link for Skype is on there but the app is not pre-loaded.<br /><br />Books read well on this, and this being my first Fire, I like the interface for reading books, though I definitely prefer e-readers for eyestrain reasons. It's nice that the FireHD has text-to-speech, especially since the PaperWhite lost this functionality (which I think was a great move; that device is an e-READER, not e-audibleprovider). The three backgrounds should help users with some of the eyestrain for limited periods of reading.<br /><br />I have not yet connected this to my corporate Exchange servers, and quite honestly I may not bother. But it's nice to know that's an option. Email for Gmail works well, with an occasional \\\\\"stutter\\\\\" to the interface while it's loading something from the web (see my comment in the next paragraph for Performance). I doubt I will do much email from this device, but again, it's nice to know that it's there, in a pinch.<br /><br />Performance: The processor is fast. It's not perfectly smooth, but reasonable. The vast majority of the lag, from what I have seen, revolves around network operations. Basically, if a screen has to load an image, or some other content, from the Internet or Amazon, the device can, and will, \\\\\"stutter\\\\\" occasionally. I guess there could be adjustments done to the interface to avoid this, but the fact is that to me, it isn't distracting from the experience. Temple Run and various other games run very smoothly on the device. I know it's about to sound harsh, but I would expect nothing less from an Android 4.0-based device. :)<br /><br />The storage (I got the 16GB version) is adequate for what I will use it for - mostly media streaming from the Web, plus some locally installed apps, games, and side-loaded books. Anything else will be on the Cloud. If you're a heavy movie watcher and want them loaded on the device itself (perhaps you would use this on a bus or commuter train), you may want to wait until October for the 32GB version; the $50 difference would be worth it, then.<br /><br />Wireless: Out of the box, Bluetooth is disabled (which is a good thing, don't want anyone hacking our precious new toy, now do we?). Since I have not been able to get Flash, I cannot benchmark the wireless (TWCable and Speedtest.net use Flash). Huh, now I know what it's like to use an Apple product. :) However, all file transfers happen as fast as most other wireless hardware I have around the house, and video streaming of HD looks crisp and clear. Video playback looks clean and the controls are easy to use.<br /><br />Buttons/Interface: I don't like where they placed the camera on the device. I personally think it should be on the other side, so that the camera is \\\\\"up\\\\\" when put in a case that allows for stand-up (though, this might be my case - but I don't see how they could have easily engineered around it). The camera provides a good, clear picture for video conferencing after a brief Skype test, and appeared to operate fairly well in low light, which is encouraging for me, since many areas in my house aren't adequately lit (hence my additional order for a Kindle PaperWhite :)). The interfaces on the unit are the speakers (which are decent, but don't expect huge bass or amazing sound from tiny speakers), USB and HDMI out (THANK YOU AMAZON! The HDMI interface, ALONE, should sway folks to this platform over other tablets!), the headphone jack (which is well-placed, not too near a corner and not recessed as early iPhones were), and the power and volume rocker buttons.<br /><br />Quite honestly, the only poor thing about the device is the power and volume rocker buttons. They are flush with the chassis, have little gap between them and the chassis, and are the same color as the chassis (black). This means that, every time I sleep the unit or adjust volume, I'm squinting at the top of the Fire to figure out where the heck the buttons are. While it is, technically, possible to \\\\\"feel\\\\\" your way to the buttons, it's impractical - since the volume rocker buttons have a tiny raised edge which \\\\\"announces\\\\\" their presence, but they are not differently-sized (smaller nubbin for \\\\\"lower volume\\\\\", larger nubbin for \\\\\"increase volume\\\\\"). I think that, in time, the power button will be easier to find, since it's smack-dab-in-the-middle of the top, but for now, it's kind of a hunt, especially with a case on. I would have preferred a raised button. But believe me, this is a very minor complaint on an otherwise excellent interface implementation.<br /><br />Here's where the \\\\\"religious war\\\\\" starts. First off, I refuse to compare tablets purely on a hardware basis as, inherently, a contest of \\\\\"this one is best.\\\\\" That's a technological no-win situation. Also, I firmly believe that, as a technology, tablets (of all kinds, not just the FireHD), since their inception, have been a solution looking for a problem. They are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. They are neat gadgets, but in and of themselves, they cannot do a tenth of what an average Netbook or laptop computer is capable of, and with current price points for decent laptops in the $400-500 range, it's hard to justify a tablet based on hardware alone. And I'm glad that Bezos and others at Amazon \\\\\"get\\\\\" this - I can't tell you how many friends and family members I know that own tablets, and never use them - because they want a keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Here's where the FireHD shines. I think that the perfect niche for a tablet, where it can have a chance to be a \\\\\"master\\\\\" as opposed to a \\\\\"master of none\\\\\" - is in the singular application of being a multimedia consumption device. When a user wants to read a book, listen to music, watch a movie - they want a simple, point-and-shoot interface. And a tablet provides not only the interface, but the mobility.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />I feel that the FireHD is really what tablet users should be looking for.

If you're a heavy movie watcher and want them loaded on the device itself (perhaps you would use this on a bus or commuter train), you may want to wait until October for the 32GB version; the $50 difference would be worth it, then.<br /><br />Wireless: Out of the box, Bluetooth is disabled (which is a good thing, don't want anyone hacking our precious new toy, now do we?). Since I have not been able to get Flash, I cannot benchmark the wireless (TWCable and Speedtest.net use Flash). Huh, now I know what it's like to use an Apple product. :) However, all file transfers happen as fast as most other wireless hardware I have around the house, and video streaming of HD looks crisp and clear. Video playback looks clean and the controls are easy to use.<br /><br />Buttons/Interface: I don't like where they placed the camera on the device. I personally think it should be on the other side, so that the camera is \\\\\"up\\\\\" when put in a case that allows for stand-up (though, this might be my case - but I don't see how they could have easily engineered around it). The camera provides a good, clear picture for video conferencing after a brief Skype test, and appeared to operate fairly well in low light, which is encouraging for me, since many areas in my house aren't adequately lit (hence my additional order for a Kindle PaperWhite :)). The interfaces on the unit are the speakers (which are decent, but don't expect huge bass or amazing sound from tiny speakers), USB and HDMI out (THANK YOU AMAZON! The HDMI interface, ALONE, should sway folks to this platform over other tablets!), the headphone jack (which is well-placed, not too near a corner and not recessed as early iPhones were), and the power and volume rocker buttons.<br /><br />Quite honestly, the only poor thing about the device is the power and volume rocker buttons. They are flush with the chassis, have little gap between them and the chassis, and are the same color as the chassis (black). This means that, every time I sleep the unit or adjust volume, I'm squinting at the top of the Fire to figure out where the heck the buttons are. While it is, technically, possible to \\\\\"feel\\\\\" your way to the buttons, it's impractical - since the volume rocker buttons have a tiny raised edge which \\\\\"announces\\\\\" their presence, but they are not differently-sized (smaller nubbin for \\\\\"lower volume\\\\\", larger nubbin for \\\\\"increase volume\\\\\"). I think that, in time, the power button will be easier to find, since it's smack-dab-in-the-middle of the top, but for now, it's kind of a hunt, especially with a case on. I would have preferred a raised button. But believe me, this is a very minor complaint on an otherwise excellent interface implementation.<br /><br />Here's where the \\\\\"religious war\\\\\" starts. First off, I refuse to compare tablets purely on a hardware basis as, inherently, a contest of \\\\\"this one is best.\\\\\" That's a technological no-win situation. Also, I firmly believe that, as a technology, tablets (of all kinds, not just the FireHD), since their inception, have been a solution looking for a problem. They are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. They are neat gadgets, but in and of themselves, they cannot do a tenth of what an average Netbook or laptop computer is capable of, and with current price points for decent laptops in the $400-500 range, it's hard to justify a tablet based on hardware alone. And I'm glad that Bezos and others at Amazon \\\\\"get\\\\\" this - I can't tell you how many friends and family members I know that own tablets, and never use them - because they want a keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Here's where the FireHD shines. I think that the perfect niche for a tablet, where it can have a chance to be a \\\\\"master\\\\\" as opposed to a \\\\\"master of none\\\\\" - is in the singular application of being a multimedia consumption device. When a user wants to read a book, listen to music, watch a movie - they want a simple, point-and-shoot interface. And a tablet provides not only the interface, but the mobility.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />I feel that the FireHD is really what tablet users should be looking for. We should be looking at a device that provides easy, mobile access to an ecosystem of rich media, with features and accessibility that make it easy to use and enjoy.

Long story short is that the CISCO bridge is a pain to set-up. I returned it. It isn't even compatible with a MAC unless you manually set it up with the help of someone over the phone in India. WHich I tried to do but as soon as they heard I didn't have a Linksys router/DSL modem they didn't really know how to help me. It was comical.   They said \\\\\"Don't you have a PC you can use to set this up?\\\\\"  And then \\\\\" You mean your DSL modem/router is not a CISCO/LINKSYS?\\\\\"  No and No.  Sorry!  Their help was very limited and this was a function of the bad design of this bridge.  Annoying that the bridge isn't plug and play in 2010! AND WHY WOULD SONY NOT BUILD IN WIFI? Apple TV does it! Wii does it! Xbox does it! AND YOU KNOW WHAT? They are all plug and play!!!! Can you imagine inserting a disc in your computer to configure a wireless device like the CISCO bridge? Apparently CISCO can!!!!! Crazy!! I guess we are all so spoiled by technology that when something bone headed like this comes along there is no mercy.    I ended up moving my DSL modem/router to behind my TV and plugged it into my Blue-ray directly. Probably a better configuration anyway with no real downside to my home network needs.

Usability on the device is also good and battery life is satisfactory at 1-2 days depending on wireless usage.     Some of the additional positives include decent prices on both books and newspapers. Plus, the newspapers at present are advertising free.     Regarding areas of concern, I am fairly certain I don't like the idea of having my content locked-in to Amazon/Kindle due to their DRM. How will I feel after purchasing tens or hundreds of books that can't be moved to some other eReader? Not too good. This is a question all potential buyers need to ask themselves.    I also find the charges for blogs to be a bit silly since most haven't even been reformatted for easy reading on the Kindle (they contain numerous links and such that are generally useless given the poor browsing experience of the Kindle).    Overall, I rate the Kindle pretty highly and look forward to seeing future evolutions of the product line that will solve some of the current concerns.",

(The BIOS it came with clocked it at 1333). Flashing the BIOS with the downloadable @BIOS utility was a breeze.<br />-All the ports that I've used work.<br />-I like the look of it. Gunmetal blacks and grays really do make it seem like an &#34;Ultra Durable&#34; motherboard.<br />-It's stable, and has all the options you'd want to to overclock (which I don't.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The BIOS is less intuitive than my old ASUS motherboard.<br />-USB support during POST is touchy (making entering the BIOS set up frustrating). I have an older keyboard with a split end so it can be either USB or PS/2, but that means I have to drag out another device while trouble shooting.<br />-There's a completely unexplained lag between the POST screen and the Windows 8 loading screen. It shows a blank screen with a blinking cursor, then a screen that says &#34;Loading operating system&#34; both for about 5 seconds each. I'm running a SSD build, and I'm this annoying sequence is slowing down my reboots. I've tried IDE and AHCI modes, and disabled and removed everything but the SSD, and still those 2 screens plague me. I've upgraded the firmware for my drives, all the drivers, and have the latest chipset. There's no &#34;Quick Boot&#34; option for this motherboard, and I doubt that would fix it anyway, since nothing else I attempted made 1 second of difference to those screens.<br /><br /> My wife inherited my old ASUS M4A785-M Motherboard running a Phenom II X2 555 Black Edition Callisto 3.2 GHz, unlocked to 4 cores. (Both purchased from Amazon.) I also upgraded her to a SSD drive and Windows 8. Now, that 2+ year old rig boots in about half the time my current one does,and the sole culprit is THIS motherboard. (Hers barely shows the POST screen, and you see the Window's loading for half a second before it's up and running.)<br /> After doing some research online, I've found out that this is a big issue with various Gigabyte motherboards, and the fix that works for most people (setting the SSD/HDD as the 1st boot device) does nothing for me.<br /><br />I've had this board for over 4 months now, and I wish I would have stuck with ASUS (the maker of my previous two MOBOs which had lightning quick boots.) I would send it back, at this point, if I could. What's the point of having AMD's best processor and a SSD drive if I can't even have boot-time bragging rights?

            "input": "The Toshiba Encore 2 WT8 is a basic/value personal travel PC that hits the target. This full Windows 8.1 tablet provides a responsive experience in the user interface, but isn't speedy by any measure.<br /><br />The entry nature of the Encore 2 is apparent by the very low price ($144 best price on Amazon as of this review), only wireless N (no AC), just one USB 2 (not USB 3!), no HDMI or other video out. Bright spots are 64GB storage, and 2 GB of RAM as opposed to the more common 32GB storage and 1GB RAM. The extra RAM helps make this a bit faster than 1GB Win 8.1 tablets.<br /><br />This is a home/personal oriented tablet. This is apparent by the selection of preloaded apps/adware/and trial-ware.  For business I'll be removing a bunch of this annoying stuff.<br /><br />The Encore 2 includes Office 365 personal for 1 year. I don't like the Office 365 subscription model and would rather have had the perpetually licensed office 2013. I don't consider this a big plus or minus with how I plan to use this tablet.<br /><br />A 30 day trial of  Norton Internet Security included. I would suggest dumping this older version of Norton and installing the newer [[ASIN:B00MHZ6Z64 Norton Security]] or [[ASIN:B00MHZ71G2 Norton Security with Backup]]. Those will cover 5 or 10 devices respectively. Useful if you have several Windows, Android, Mac devices. Norton has an IOS app but with very limited function.<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 5, 2015:<br />There is an adapter to use the more common USB A ended cables with the Encore WT8 micro USB connector: [[ASIN:B00KSTFNBO IVSO Micro USB 2.0 Host OTG Cable for Toshiba Encore 7 ,Toshiba Encore 2 8-inch,Toshiba Encore 2 10-inch,Toshiba Encore WT8 Tablet]]. While would not help in charging it may help in hooking existing USB devices to the Encore.<br /><br />The Encore 2's 8 inch is large enough to be usable. In general the touch screen has been responsive. With some closely spaced buttons on the screen I have hit the wrong one. This might be my fingers or the smallish screen or both. The screen is bright and pretty sharp. There is no external monitor connection on this tablet. No mini-hdmi like the 10 inch version of the encore 2 adds.<br /><br />The on-screen keyboard is surprisingly good and easy to type on. I got a [[ASIN:B00KMQ5LLU Bluetooth Keyboard Portfolio Case]] since I didn't expect the on-screen typing to be so good. The case is nice and the keyboard works fine. If I had it to do over I might choose a non-keyboard case to be lighter and more compact. To be clear: this is a nice case.<br /><br />The 64GB of flash storage seems about right to me for this level of tablet. A micro SD card can expand storage by up to 128GB (192GB total with internal). I have not used a microSD so far in my testing and use.<br /><br />Battery life has been fine. I have used it all day without getting below 25%. This is intermittent use traveling from client to client. It charges in a few hours via the supplied charger and USB cable through the micro USB port.<br /><br />I have used the Encore mainly for web surfing and managing email while away from the house/office but within range of a WiFi signal (including my phone's mobile hotspot). For these purposes the 8 inch screen is large enough to be useful but not so big I am likely to leave it behind.<br /><br />To summarize: the Toshiba Encore 2 WT8 is targeted to the personal/home market with a bargain price. Getting that low price is a tradeoff in features/performance. This is an entry level tablet and with that expectation you get what you pay for.<br /><br />For those who like details here is a list of the Specs for the Encore 2 WT8-B264 Tablet:<br /><br />Software<br />- Windows 8.1 (Bing preinstalled)<br />- Office 365 Personal* 1-year.

I did some looking around online and discovered this beautiful piece of technology. <br /> <br />What this does for you is it places most of the important hotkeys you need for first person shooters and pvp-heavy games like World of Warcraft right within your left-hand's reach so you can switch weapons, abilities spells almost instantaneously, and will improve your performance a LOT.  Ever since I got this, my reaction time has improved dramatically.  When you fight another player in WoW, use of skills to counter-attack other players is CRITICAL.  Once you get used to playing with it, I bet you can't play without it. <br /> <br />That being said, there is a transitional period for this thing.  I used to play games using the W,S,A,D keys to move around and the mouse button to look.  What the speedpad does, is force you to learn a new method of controlling your character, which takes a bit of time to get used to, but after about a week, it becomes second-nature.  I personally wanted to throw this thing through the window after configuring the WSAD keys to the thumbpad on the Nostromo, since using the WSAD keys on the Speedpad takes up valuable hotkey spaces unless you bind them to the thumbpad.  After dying over and over and over and over, you'll get so frustrated, but give it a week, and you'll notice your gameplay getting better and better and better...to the point where you can't play without it.  It took me about 3 days to start to notice some improvements, and about 7 days before I got used to it. <br /> <br />The customization program along with it is amazing too.  You can customize your own macros to use in games to get off some nice combos.  Or single-bind any one key to any button the speedpad.  Its totally up to you, you have total control.  What I will suggest though is that you bind the WSAD keys to the thumbpad and take the time to get used to it. <br /> <br />Now for the downsides.  Well I only found two.  The orange/red trigger above the d-pad and the mouse wheel.  Both are VERY VERY hard to press.  The mouse wheel turns just fine, but pushing it in requires a little bit of effort, and requires a little more force to push in than to push a key on the keyboard.  This is a small problem though, nothing to worry too much about.  I bound my jump key to the red button or pushing in on the mouse wheel so jumping isn't really THAT essential.  If there was a way to make it easier to push in, it would help a little :). <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great buy.  Even if you don't like it, you can send it back to the company for a full refund.  Just give it one week, and even though you might get killed a lot, don't give up on it.  I kept wanting to go back to the keyboard every time I would get killed, but I kept at it, and I'm glad I did.  If you set this up right, you'll notice some signifigant improvements in your gameplay - just keep at it!",

I teach computer science part-time at the university level.<br /><br />The short of it is that the Samsung is more tablet for less money. I bought mine for under $300. Both have a 1Ghz dual core processor. The Samsung has double the RAM (1GB vs. 512MB), microSD storage expansion capability, and significantly higher resolution (1280x800 vs. 1024x768). The Samsung display is also larger (10.1\\\\\" vs. 9.7\\\\\"). Both have Bluetooth, but the Samsung runs a newer version (3 vs. 2.1).<br /><br />Unlike the iPad, the Samsung is Flash friendly. Installing Flash from Google Play is easiest on all but the most recently produced Tab 2s. If you have the most recent one, like I do, installing Flash for Android 4.0 from the Adobe Flash archive site was just a little bit more work.<br /><br />Battery life is another advantage of the Tab 2 over the iPad 2. The Tab 2 has a 7000 mAh battery rated at 14 hours. The iPad 2 is rated at 10 hours (Apple tends not to share detailed specifications).<br /><br />The iPad 2 and Tab 2 have comparable forward and back facing cameras. At a little over 3mp on the rear camera, neither is particularly special. The iPad 3 and Galaxy Note include a 5mp rear camera that does a better job. Still, neither the 3mp nor the 5mp camera is going to give you results comparable to even a sub $50 digial camera with a much higher resolution chip and larger optics.<br /><br />When you compare the Tab 2 with the comparably priced iPad Mini, the iPad does even more poorly. For a tablet that gives the Tab 2 a run for its money, you might want to take a look at the new $400 Nexus 10. The Samsung produced Nexus 10 display is the highest resolution on the market at a fraction of the price of iPad 3s and 4s.",

I\u2019ve had no issues with it not working as designed in regard to the \u201cfolding\u201d stand.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because mine had a small wrinkle in the \u201cleather\u201d where it\u2019s glues to the back which should have been pretty obvious to the manufacturer when they did their QA checks (If they even do QA checks). And the edges of the cover are annoyingly \u201dsharp\u201d.

Nope, shipping was crazy fast, I open the package and find a true leather/pleather case/stand that I saw going from anywhere from 20 - 60 dollars plus shipping from others. I was amazed!! It uses velcro to adjust the viewing angle which I like. I would rather be able to adjust to my needs than be stuck with the common 3. The tablet fits perfect, both front and rear camera holes line up perfectly. I trust my tablet being in this case, it is very sturdy. The only con which I could not hold against the case (thus the 5 star rating) is the thickness easily doubles the table size in thickness, BUT that is due to the function of the amazing case. So this boils down to function over form or 10 bucks for an amazing case....no brainer, get one now!",

When you configure any accessory for your existing device, what you do is: choose your device (in my case it was Kindle Fire HD 7inch), then choose other properties of the accessory. In this case it was: color. And I really went through a few colors, from my original choice of color: blue to white, red, (...), and back to my original blue.<br /><br />When this is done, you just place the order. WRONG! You really have to double check what you are ordering! Because... Guess what: some color (while) was not available for my device. So, when I chose white instead of stopping right there and telling me that white is not available for _MY_ device, the configuration tool just showed me this body case for incompatible device (Kindle fire tablet), and from this point on it stays with this incompatible device when you further change color.<br /><br />So: I consider this a major fault of the configuration tool. Hence the [very bad] rating. None of accessory configuration tools I used during past 10 years ever did something like that.<br /><br />I did return my case and got refunded for that (Thanks, the seller!) - minus shipping both ways. As being honest person, I couldn't say wrong item was sent to me - I received what my order reads. And I did order the compatible one - from the same seller!<br /><br />I hope, this helps others, as the configuration tool is a crap and is pushing to sell you what you don't need (it does this under some circumstances I mean ;-)<br /><br />Valeri",

Those are the \\\\\"smart charging\\\\\" ports (maximum 2.4A output). The other tablet and other phone were connected to regular charging ports (maximum 1.0A output). All devices had less than a 60% charge at the start of the test. The two tablets and the two phones recharged at speeds comparable to what I've noted with the single port chargers I've been using. I put a USB power meter on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\\\\\" tablet, and I showed the results in the accompanying video. I had the charging station connected and powered up for about four hours, and the charging station and AC power supply never got more than slightly warm to the touch.<br /><br />The 6-port charger makes a lot more sense than the shelf full of single port chargers that my wife and I use.<br /><br />A product sample was provided for review purposes.",

Clip the two sensors over the two incoming 240-volt lines feeding your breaker panel, plug the sensors' output lines into the provided transmitter, push the LINK buttons, and the transmitter is wirelessly connected to the portable display unit.  The robust wireless link operates at 433.5 MHz and will not suffer interference from cordless phones or WiFi networks.<br /><br />The display unit is updated every 10 seconds. It shows the instantaneous power in kW, and the average daily energy consumption in kWh for the current, and each of the previous seven days. Other informative historical data are also stored in the device and can be displayed readily. When set to display the instantaneous power, it is useful to walk through the house, display unit in hand, as you turn lights and appliances on and off. It's quite an eye opener.  (Five stars so far.)<br /><br />The company also provides software for Macs and PCs.  After reading the literature, and after contacting the vendor, it wasn't at all clear to me how the data get to the computer, but it became obvious once the equipment arrived: there was a USB cable included that plugs into the back of the display unit and into one of the computer's USB ports.<br /><br />There was no software disc included, instead a link to the company's website was provided. Things now became confusing with the software links buried in advertising. To make a long story short, one claimed Mac link downloaded the PC version, but ultimately, after major fiddling, the proper software was installed successfully.  I would recommend that the company appoint an individual to sit beside a newbie as he attempts to follow the installation instructions.  This way the major potholes (sink holes) in the instruction manual would become obvious and could be paved over.<br /><br />The Mac software v2.2 (I can't comment on the PC version) appears to be quite solid andinformative and provides a valuable adjunct to the handheld display. It is NOT required if you are happy with the information provided by the display unit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.  The unnecessarily-frustrating software fiddling cost the company one star in my evaluation.",

I do wish that the grooves that hold up the iPad were just a little bit deeper, but they aren't too bad and are much better than other options available.  Overall, this is a good case.  I love how it looks and the quality is better than most comparable options.<br /><br />This case looks great!!  I love the color and love the style of it.  However...<br /><br />First, after having it for only a couple of months, the edges are peeling off.  It looks very hammered and very used.  I am not rough with my iPad.  If I am not using it, it is on a table or in my purse.  I would expect a higher quality from Moko and I would also expect something that would hold up better and longer!<br /><br />Second, the grooves are not deep enough and my iPad slips a lot when it is propped up.  I do not want a cheap case to be the cause of my iPad screen getting cracked or something.<br /><br />Not really pleased with this case!!",

It took less than 5 minutes to do the initial backup, and now that I've connected the passport to my PC to update the files already backed up, it's been going for over an hour.  Same data (just a couple of edits on some excel files), same USB port, etc.  For 5GB of data.  You can copy / paste to the drive, but the whole reason I liked it is because I thought it would backup changes for me.  Sigh.    ********************************************************************  So easy to use!  I was dreading picking out a new external hard because I was sure I would experience some awful technical issue and end up buying my brother a plane ticket to Atlanta just to help me backup some music and photos of my kids.  But the WD Passort Ultra is really fast and easy to figure out.  You plug it into the USB 3.0 port if you have one (it will say &#34;SS&#34; = Super Speed) or any other USB port if you don't.  It does it's &#34;installing new hardware&#34; thing and then the notification pops up that the device is ready to use (I use my Passport using Windows 7 and Windows 8).  You go to My Computer, double click on &#34;WD Apps Setup&#34;, follow the prompts and after a minute the WD Smartware is installed on your PC.  You then double click the WD Smartware icon and you can set your preferences.  I chose continuous backup, but you can also set a certain day of the week and time to have your files backed up. I don't intend to keep the drive plugged into my PC while I work, this way it updates right away when I plug it in.  For the backup scope, I chose the advanced setting.  It says this is for experienced users, but all it asks you to do is select the folders you want to back up.  I selected my Document, Pictures, Videos & Music folders.  If you need your email backed up or anything that is not in a central location, you might want to use the default setting.  You click &#34;enable backup&#34; and it begins backing up the folders you've specified onto the Passport.  I use this drive to backup personal documents on my work PC and all doc/photos/videos/music from my personal PC.  I can view them by viewing the folders on the drive and opening the &#34;WD SmartWare.swstor&#34; folder.  There I see a folder for each of my PC's and if you drill through into those folders you will see your backed up data.  You can do all kinds of other fancy things (versioning, etc.) but I'm just trying to keep it simple.  I bought the Amazon basics case for it, and it's perfect, holds the device and the cords.",

I have a somewhat small case in terms of a mid tower, (Corsair 200R), so I need to be creative with my cooling options. Sure, you can fill your case with fans but I want to keep my noise at a bearable level. This is by far my most silent component now. I mean it can be almost inaudible up close when you play with your speed setting. Heck, my SSD is louder when the fans are @ 50%. I am very happy with its quality build. When I took it out of the box it just felt sturdy and worth the money. The heat pipes felt solid, there are tons of cooling fins, oh and by the way, just assume they are sharp when handling this one. Installation instructions were very clear and on quality paper. Overall a pretty simple installation, just make sure you plan out how your cables  will run. I had a lot of difficulty plugging my CPU power back in with this thing in the way. I installed one time to check the viscosity of the included thermal compound. A grain of rice I found to be perfect. Check ALL screws for tightness before you lock it down. Luckily I noticed some loose ones and tightened them before the final seating. Below are the results of some basic tests I ran for this cooler vs my previous.<br />Previous cooler: Corsair H50(Fan @ 100%)<br />Idle: 38-42C<br />Prime95 torture test: 68-79C<br /><br />Noctua(Fans @ 50%)<br />Idle: 32-35C<br />Prime95 torture test: 56-60C",

The screws that attach the wheel and shift stick to the table are made of plastic and give impression if you screw them too hard they'll crack. But so far so good.      Lots of cables.

I was contacted by the support team within 3 hours after I installed the program and my first scheduled maintenance started on the next day. You also have the flexibility to tell them what time of the day you want the maintenance to be performed. I would recommend to pick a slot when you do not need to use your PC for hours as they spent more than 4 hours for my first scheduled maintenance. Besides, you would not be able to tell easily while they are performing the maintenance and you might be colliding with what they do by getting on the PC. They performed 17 essential maintenance tasks on my PC including upgrading the XP service pack to SP3. They also offered to install one of the top free spyware removal programs for me after the maintenance was completed. I also received a comprehensive report through email which describes all the tasks that were performed.<br /><br />I do share some of the concerns by other reviewers. In order for Clean machine to perform remote maintenance, they installed a program called RADAR on your computer which basically gives them full control of your PC remotely.  This also means that your sensitive data could be exposed to someone you personally do not know. It also installs another program called the Bomgar jump client which I believe is for remote access and communication with the user. This program is left running continuously every time you boot up your computer. But to be fair, the exposure to your personal data would be the same whenever you send your PC to a computer shop for maintenance. If you have complicated applications which require certain windows settings untouched, I would highly recommend that you inform the support team upfront so they do not perform upgrades/changes in those areas.<br /><br />All in all, this is a nice service for those who are willing to shelve out $120 yearly for someone to maintain their PC. The type of maintenance they do could easily take 1-2 hours on the average. If you decided to terminate their service, make sure you request them to help you remove their windows user logon and  all the remote access clients they installed on your PC.<br /><br />3/21/09 (update)<br /><br />My PC was infected with some real nasty malwares last month. The support staff from PC Clean was very proactive in helping me to diagnose and fix the problems.  Kudos to the PC Clean Machine team.br /><br />All in all, this is a nice service for those who are willing to shelve out $120 yearly for someone to maintain their PC.

I built and all new computer and everything was working great for a few days it was the first time I've ever been able to play a game on Ultra settings... then poof. this thing decides it wants to update its Vbios (is part of the software) and normally I don't like updating bios for motherboards or graphics cards but I paid so much for this I figured It'd be able to handle it... NOPE!  The program crashed in the middle of the update and when I restarted it it said the most current version of the VBIOS was installed and wouldn't let me try to reinstall it through the program... so I though nothing was wrong and went about my business.  Needless to say, when I restarted my computer the motherboard kept giving me code 62 which meant something was wrong with my graphics card.  I put in and old graphics card in addition to this (my Motherboard didn't have built-in graphics) and tried to flash a new BIOS onto this card but it wouldn't work.  The computer recognized the card was in, but everything I tried to get the VBIOS corrected did not work.  After 12 HOURS of agonizingly trying to fix this card I gave up and returned it.  Thank the Maker (Dragon Age reference) for Amazon's return policy because this was my first time using an AMD/ATI graphics card and I switched back to NVIDIA.  Another beef I had when running this card was the Temperatures it ran at (normal operation) were just WAY too high... (it got to 80 Celsius before even half-way through a benchmark test) and I have 3-200mm fans (2 in 1 out) and 3-120mm (2 in 1 out) fans plus a Cooler Master case (tons of airholes) so it wasn't by any fault of my computer build that this thing ran hot.  I had to manually adjust the fan profiles to make the fans actually do their job because they were set to only kick in at 40% speed for unsafe temperatures (anything above 80 Celsius is unsafe for long-term operation I don't care what the manufacturer claims).  I was able to get the cooling under control and never saw above 87 Celsius even though it supposedly can withstand temps above 95 Celsius.  Now that I have NVIDIA back in my computer the Nvidia card runs cool(ish) not going above 70 Celsius and is idling at 27 Celsius right now (The R9 290 seemed to idle [if I remember correctly] near 40-50 Celsius).  Overall this is a good card for the buck... but if you buy it don't let it update its VBIOS (it should give a self-destruct warning since essentially the update bricked the card)... have a case with good circulation... and have it in a room with an Air Conditioner because in the middle of Northeast Ohio winter my room got HOT when running this thing.",

That is, the drive light would keep blinking and the drive would make continuous seeking noises, and if it was already mounted you might be able to open it and see the top-level folders but if you try to open anything nothing would happen (any folders will appear empty).<br /><br />If you then disconnect the drive and try to plug it back in, it'd just keep seeking and making noises. Eventually, though, after not using it or unplugging it then plugging it back on enough times the drive would be mounted successfully again and work like normal.<br /><br />At first I thought it was just because I was using it on a USB 2.0 port and gave it the benefit of the doubt. Just recently I upgraded to the retina Macbook Pro with USB 3.0 ports and you guessed it--the problem is still there.<br /><br />Since I live in a country where warranties aren't warranted, I'm stuck with this drive. It will probably be relegated to an 'archive' drive.

It clicks virtually silently when you turn a page.  For something so thin and light, it is quite sturdy.  I carry it around in my handbag and it does fine.  I haven't bought a protective case yet (after a month) but there are no scratches to either the body or screen even though my kids use it too and I bring it everywhere.  It has a very long battery life and charges quickly.

No more schlepping to bookstores!     We have tried the experimental text-to-voice and the web browser.  These are both pretty much useless.  The text to voice is flat and doesn't pronounce many words correctly.  It cannot take the place of a true audiobook.  The web browser is slow and very basic.  So these features are not very useful.  The Kindle is purely an e-reader.    This has been the best $139 I have ever spent!  If you love to read, like I do, it is gold.  No more carrying bulky books around.

I tried putting the case on the Mini from the edge side first, but the two corners don't snap and one corner either the bottom or top one of the binding side would not stay in place. If I try using the case from the binding side first, I would push down and it would make strange scratching noises like it would scratch the iPad. Am I doing something wrong?

The Sky smartpen gives me all the advantages of writing on paper (i.e., natural feel, precision, etc.) with all the benefits of my tablet (i.e., viewing, listening, and sharing with others, etc.).<br />* It was simple to connect to WiFi in my home and office using the wifi controls on the inside cover of my notebook.<br />* Having the option to directly link audio to my notes is ideal for my key company and client meetings. It really helps me recall the important details and I don't miss anything.<br />* Evernote is a great fit with Livescribe's smartpen. It does everything that the Livescribe Desktop did for my Echo smartpen, but much more.<br />o Wireless Transfer: Sends my notes wirelessly to my Evernote account --- this is much better than having to use a USB cable to transfer my notes to my laptop.<br />o Sync: I can now sync and access my notes (and audio) on my iPad, my laptop, and my Samsung phone.  This is really convenient.<br />o Search: I can still search my handwritten notes like before with the Livescribe Desktop, but now I can also add tags and search on them as well.<br />o Organization: I have more flexibility to organize and group info in the way that I want. Since Evernote supports almost every file type, I can put my handwritten notes, project spreadsheets, and presentations into the same notebook.<br />o Sharing: Sharing my project meeting notes is now much faster and easier. From Evernote, I can easily share pages of notes or an entire project notebook with my team.<br />o Storage: the Livescribe package included an extra 500MB of free upload capacity to Evernote every month - plenty of room for my notes and recordings.<br />* The online product videos were pretty helpful in learning how to use Sky and learning more about how it works with Evernote.<br /><br />Cons<br />====<br />* Initial out-of-box experience was a little clunky and took longer than I expected to update the software on the smartpen.<br />* I had some initial problems in syncing my handwritten notes with my Evernote account, but recent upgrades from Livescribe solved the problem.<br />* The experience using Livescribe's Player which uses your default web browser for replaying pencasts (your handwritten notes and audio that's plays back like an interactive movie) seems to vary quite a bit by the type of browser you use. For the best experience, I highly recommend using Chrome or Safari which seems to be quick and responsive with the Livescribe player. I would definitely avoid using IE9 (which pretty much sucks with the Livescribe player) and Firefox (which seems slow and often struggles with audio playback). It might be worth trying IE10 as well.",

In some ways I bought the Belkin as a \\\\\"worth a try,\\\\\" but kind of figuring that it would be an interim choice until I can get a Griffin.  I am on my second New iPad -- I dropped my first one having it less than a month!  That iPad was in an InCase folio-style case.  Now I'm pretty serious about protection.<br /><br />This case is really just OK.  It's definitely not awesome.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Color is nice - I can see it anywhere<br />The padding feels reasonably dependable, especially at the corners where your iPad is most likely to land<br />Easy to install<br />Has a good tactile feel.  The way the sides and back are molded, you get a nice kind of \\\\\"handle\\\\\" to hold onto.<br />All the ports and holes line up well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very easy to pull off at the sides without intending to.  The edges that wrap across the front of the iPad only cover about half of the unused portion of the screen.  If they had just made the edge just a little wider, it would be 1000x better.  This makes it feel kinda flimsy and loose, like the iPad is moving around in the case.<br /><br />The openings for all the ports and buttons really degrade the structure of the case, especially around the area that has the volume controls, on-off switch, and rear camera.  That one corner feels much smooshier and more vulnerable than the other corneres.<br /><br />The area around the charger port is really weak.  Doesn't feel strong there at all.<br /><br />The silicone attracts lint and dog hair.  This is probably just what silicone does, but if this would bug you you might look for some other material.<br /><br />The New iPad supposedly runs hot, but I never experienced that using the InCase folio.

Yet more problems I have seen are as follows: you cannot play DVDs on this computer, the web cam is sub-par at best, any iPhone or Apple product will not cooperate with this laptop, downloading pictures is a long and infuriating task, the battery never holds a charge for longer than three hours, you cannot watch movies (as the screen will turn black), and the speakers are very quiet at its loudest. I highly recommend shelling out the cash for a better product such as a Mac.",

For example, knowing how to set the flight controls for wind direction during taxiing should not require any thought, and neither should the various procedures and speeds in the pattern (carb heat when throttle is below green, flaps only below 110, trim for 60 kias for touchdown, etc.). One should also be able to make radio calls while doing everything else.<br /><br />Having started with a real plane first (172), I wasn't expecting a feeling of realistic flight, and have others have noted, the Saitek yoke is just an approximation. It is indeed notchy, and somewhat sticky-feeling.<br /><br />However, my real complaint about what has been marketed as a Cessna-approved product is that Saitek sells the package with a throttle system which is nothing like a Cessna. And after all, just about everyone learns to fly in a 150 or 172. Instead, you have to buy the Cessna-type throttle for an extra $150! And even if you do spend the extra money, Saitek's &#34;Cessna&#34; push-pull throttle omits what should be right next to the throttle: carb heat. After all, if you do intend to practice for a Cessna, knowing when to use carb heat should be second-nature. I've been taught to land with right hand on both throttle and carb heat in the event I have to abort a landing. Is carb heat important? Well, if you're turning base and you forgot to put your carb heat on and your engine ices over and quits at 500 ft, you may well die. You will not have enough speed or altitude at that point to make the runway.<br /><br />Saitek should have included the (correctly-designed) Cessna throttle, or designed it into the Cessna Yoke housing, which would save on desk space and the need for wires going everywhere. Otherwise, what's the point?<br /><br />However, one can make a guess as to why Saitek continues to sell the incorrect throttle quadrant with the Cessna package:<br />The decades-old serial connection to the yoke suggests that they made a bazillion of them long ago, and are still stuck with stock.<br />These things should have been switched to USB.<br /><br />All in all, I suppose Saitek's gear is better than nothing. But as far as accuracy concerning the most basic controls in a real Cessna, especially for what is a premium price for the &#34;Cessna&#34; sticker, Saitek has done a half-assed job. This thing should cost a fraction of what they get for it. They say that general aviation is suffering due to the cost of flying. Well, guess what: even fake flying is overpriced...",

Now the keys just pop up or fall over and after some research I learned this is a very crappy keyboard.<br />I wondered when I did searches on the Gateway NV55c I would see dozens of websites with the keyboard for sale anywhere from $15 to $30.<br />You will either have to keep buying keyboards or purchase a separate usb or wireless keyboard eventually (but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying<br />a laptop.  I can say with confidence. I do not recommend this laptop because you cannot get an improved keyboard.

I thought it might be the hard drive, so I put in a different one - still nothing. And finally I tried that hard drive on my mac and, you guessed it, nothing. I'm not sure if I received a faulty drive but either way, that thing was going back.<br /><br />The aluminum is nice but the way the drive mounts is horrendous. basically, you plug the drive into the SATA connector and shove it into the enclosure. But, if your hard drive is of normal laptop drive thickness, it just floats there. There is no support on the other side which means once you put it in the enclosure, it's susceptible to being knocked around by the slightest movement. The entire drive is supported by the protruding SATA connection which is not designed to support it. I have no doubt that if it had work and I had kept it, it would have damaged my hard drive connection.<br /><br />After I returned it I bought this enclosure from Acomdata. A little more expensive, but a ton less than having to replace a broken hard drive and trying to recover data. The Acomdata drive is ten times better.

What it will do is allow an Apple cube to be connected with an up-to date DVI screen.  To use an Apple Studio ADC terminated screen one needs an apple adaptor costing $350.  The item is costly because the studio screen does not contain a power supply and draws its power from the Cube to operate the screen itself and to power the 2x USB sockets at the rear of the screen. Any one wishing to update the Cube for an Apple Mini would do better to buy an iMac which comes complete with the latest screen technology and the Duo intel core processors with Snow leopard SW",

I immediately went down to the local big box store looking for a basic mouse. Can you believe they didn't have one? So I picked up the next step up, a Microsoft \\\\\"comfort\\\\\" mouse. Okay, felt nice but didn't work with Autocad - the middle mouse button was delayed and after looking online this seems to be a common problem. So back it went. Went to a different box store and picked up a different brand - piece of junk.<br /><br />Frustrated I went to the local K-Mart which I try to avoid and saw this mouse and was leary of it's flashy appearance. I thought I might as well try it out as a last resort and when I got it home and plugged it in and saw that the middle mouse roller button glows red (thanks to a red LED) I rolled my eyes and thought - give me a break! I don't need flash - I need functionality. Well, I must say this little mouse delivers in both areas and is fully functional with Autocad although the roller button sits a little lower than the old trusty Microsoft I had. After a little getting used to it - it works great, feels great, and looks great!<br /><br />The Good:<br />--------------------<br />This is my first 'laser' mouse - I didn't know there was such a thing and it seems to function real good. So good, in fact, that I can now stash my mouse pad away which I was previously using because my IR mouse couldn't pick up the wood grain on the desk effectively. This laser mouse works great in that regard.<br /><br />The contour of this mouse is nice and fits my hand well. The buttons have a nice feel. It's not a sharp click but more like a comfortable sine-wave style click... smooth! The mouse wheel and button are smooth as butter as well. Everything is also nice and soft thanks to a contoured rubber moulding everywhere your fingers and hand rests.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this mouse if you're in the market for a basic replacement. Sorry Amazon but I got this for $14 and change at the local K-mart. Might check your local stores before buying online on this one.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />----------------------<br />That LED in the mouse wheel may look good but as I said - I'm not looking for flash but functionality. It's annoying that it doesn't ever 'sleep' - it stays on all the time your computer is on.<br /><br />*****************************<br />UPDATE::::: REDUCED FROM FIVE STARS TO ONE!!!<br />After 6 months or so of usage the wheel intermittently doesn't engage and just spins without activating the scroll function. Additionally, the little plastic feet came off over a month ago and I've had to resort to putting tape on the bottom in order to get it to move smoothly along my desk.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I would not recommend this mouse as it hasn't even lasted a year without some serious issues. I'll be buying something else soon.",

I told her I was extremely unhappy and asked if she would like to make an unhappy customer happy for the relatively low price of a power adaptor (retail $49.99, their cost = much less). Nope. So I went online to the Web site she provided - and they are out of stock. So now I have a paperweight until ASUS can restock power supplies.

For the light use this adaptor has seen in nine months (actually it started giving me intermittent problems in eight months)this is a very poor product.",

But then as I tried using the browser, it took about 2 minutes to load a page as opposed to about 5 secs. I tested this a few times unplugging and disconnecting the device, but it was definitely the booster that was causing the delay. In addition, the switch for the boost strength was recessed or fell in, so that I had a hard time moving the switch. I got it exchanged from Amazon for a new one. Again, the switch was recessed and hard to manipulate. I was hoping the booster for the signal strength would at least work right, but it was almost as bad loading pages. To clarify, I connected this directly to the router by replacing the router's antenna with this using the supplied cord. From what I've read, this is the frequent method of using this device, not as a wireless adapter booster as per the instructions.  In summary, this device actually slowed down web page loading considerably. I also think it was poor quality that the switch was recessed and hard to access. Going through two of them was enough.",

Instead of a $99 leap pad, I got a $169 Acer Iconia. Seemed to work initially, but she soon lost interest in it, and took over my laptop. Then, by default, this became my go-to. Worked great for about 2-3 months, then the charger burned out. It was still under warranty, so Acer reluctantly sent me a replacement for the charger plug that goes into the wall. Then, slowly, the whole system turned frustratingly slow, going on to becoming slower and slower and slower. By the time the browser loaded the page, the Iconia would turn off the screen.<br /><br />8GB is woefully tiny, and the SD mount is simply for storing files and pictures, and after about 15-20 additional apps, the tablet would refuse to install more. It might not appear so much of a big deal if you are reading this before you have purchased the product, but trust me, eventually, you will hate it!<br /><br />I still stuck with the tablet loyally, as I was a handy alternative. The deal breaker happened last week, when the devise slowly totally died out. Now, the power button turns on, but nothing happens after that. The screen is blank. I checked online on other android forum. Turns out, it is pretty common. Hundreds of issues reported, where the mother board fries itself, after about a year of use. I checked with Best Buy Geeksqaud and they say, they have seen this many times. Their suggestion was to just buy a new one (this time, get an established brand, like Apple or Samsung, as the rest are still figuring it out, it seems) as the cost of repairing this one would run into at least $100 to $150!<br /><br />Acer customer service is the most painful part of  this whole experience. They wont even talk! They are not willing to stand behind their product, and look for excuses to get you off their phone/chat, whereever you manage to catch them. I guess, its an outsourced function for Acer, where some overseas cheap company handles the customer care (pain) function and they couldn't care less!<br /><br />I am writing this review for those who are still considering purchasing this product. Just dont bother, unless you have so much money, that you wish to spend $250 every year on tablets, and go through the bother of losing all your memories, pictures, datas every so often. Needless to say, just stay away  from Acer tablets. This review applies to [[ASIN:B006XGCQ2U Acer Iconia A200-10g16u 10.1-Inch Screen Tablet - Titanium Gray]]",

Unfortunately, when you get it, the material reminds me of a cheesey 1970's diner fabric. Quality is mediocore, and the edges that hold the mini in place are starting to peel already! By far the worst part of this is that the tabs that hold it in place overlap the narrow part of the bezel and block out about a quarter inch of the screen. I didn't think it would be a big deal, but after a while it really gets annoying having to move the edge to be able to tap an icon that is being blocked. So much so, that I no longer use it.

Return within 30day return period was relatively pain free<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />At $149 ($30 cheaper than HP) for a real computer a decent buy.<br /><br />1. Much smaller and lighter than a laptop for travelling.<br />2. Leverage the T-Mobile capability when Wifi was unavailable.<br />3. Load a few apps and games.<br />4. A real computer with a file manager, micro USB for file transfer.<br />5. A cheap guinea pig device to upgrade to free Win 10 and try it out to reduce aggravation before I jump in with both feet to upgrade my laptop.<br />6.  Maybe stream shows or display tablet screen to my TV.<br />7.  32GB storage expandable to 64GB via micro SD.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1. Weak Wi-Fi reception  which was an annoyance. I would have had to buy a Wi-Fi range extender whereas no other devices I own have any problem with Wi-Fi reception in same location.<br /><br />2. Tablet sometimes froze while trying to stream video wirelessly to TV using Microsoft Wireless display adapter.<br /><br />3. Not sure why but if I was logged on as one standard user, turned off all radios (Wi-Fi, Cellular), shut down, rebooted and  tried to logon as a different standard user the Stream would return a message \u201cDevice is offline, logon as prior user\u201d message.<br /><br />4. Tablet is not MHL capable (MHL micro usb/HDMI cable to TV would not work).  I contacted HP before purchase.  First HP support rep said it was MHL capable.  I ordered MHL cable after placing tablet order.  Found out from second HP support rep Stream 8 is Not MHL capable.<br /><br />5. MS App Store Implementation - Microsoft\u2019s app store implementation is dumb (I am not talking about number of apps available).  In order to download apps you must have a Microsoft account locally installed on the Stream 8.  So when you are using apps you are logged on to app store (unlessapp can be used with Wi-Fi and Cellular turned off).  This is idiotic.  If you want to install an app you should merely be able to login to app store, download app, and log out.  Also \u2013 app is available for only the MS account on Stream 8 it was downloaded to and cannot be shared with any other user accounts on device.  I found out after the fact customers have complained about this MS app store implementation in forums for several years.<br /><br />6. Can\u2019t use 32GB Micro SD storage to store apps or store downloaded maps for a map app such as HERE maps.<br /><br />7.  OS  Microsoft Answer Desk - I was somewhat disappointed in Microsoft Answer Desk (they were ok if Windows 8.1 questions did not go beyond their script) but get beyond their scope and it was \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get you to paid support\u201d.  It was interesting when they sent follow up emails regarding a question discussed in a chat with a link to the answer desk indicating if I wanted to discuss the issue again with the same support rep just click on the link, but in reality it was impossible to reach the same support rep to discuss instructions the rep had previously provided.",

Honestly, I don't know who was responsible to designing this laptop but it's just awful.    Cons:  1. AMD processor is really slow.  Do a SuperPI calc to 2m and you'll find it at least TWICE as slow as a comparable Intel processor.  Not only that, Windows 7 is just sluggish.  Opening photos should not take several seconds, please, it's ok for my Atom based netbook for not for this notebook.  Try running anything above 360p on Youtube and you'll see how bad this laptop is.    2. Battery life.  What battery life? You'll be lucky to get over 2hrs in real life usage with wifi. My battery after two months of usage went bad and now only gives me 30mins.    3. Problems with going in and out of sleep mode, it takes forever and if you accidently shut the lid while it's going into sleep mode it just hangs and dosen't go into sleep mode and stays on in a strange state, wasting your battery life.    4. It gets hot. After about 15mins on your lap you'll want to place a book as a shield due to the heat. I've had about 16 laptops and this is definitely on the hotter side. The hottest laptop I've had was the ultra light Dell X1, but that was ok since that was a fanless design, unlike this Thinkpad Edge.    Less serious design problems:     5. Power cord is on the right side. With most users being right handed why would you want a cord hanging out on the same side as where you use a mouse?  Also the headphone jack is on the right side too, so they want you to stick a bunch of cords on the right side of the laptop?????  Painful.    6. Delete button not in an easily accessible position. It's on the top right embedded THIRD from the right. Why not make it the 1st button from the right?    7. Putting the Fn button where the Ctrl button should be, in the left most bottom corner of the keyboard. Come on, this is an EASY one, sheesh.    8.Microphone is placed under the Fn button.. umm shouldn't it but next to the camera on the lid? Large hands will actually cover that tiny hole while typing.  A terrible place for a mic.    PROs:    1. Keyboard feel is good.    2. Dual trackpad and pointer    3. Has both HDMI and VGA output.    Conclusion  I would not buy this laptop or recommend it to anyone.  As an alternative Get the ASUS UL20A-A1, yes it's a 12\\\\\" laptop but FAR superior in every way.  If you really need a 13\\\\\" laptop then the Dell V13 is also good but the battery life is weak and is a bit more expensive.",

The graphics are a bit fuzzy also, not sharp like I would expect.<br /><br />I immediately downloaded a better free productivity app from the Google Play store that was 30 years in the future from what came pre-installed. The touch inputs are slow and they hesitate. I could have just bought a kindle fire HD tablet for $99 and a $50 wireless keyboard and been 1,000 times better off. I do give some points for the case being fairly attractive, durable, protective and the keyboard having a good 'feel'.<br /><br />I care more about functionality than feel. I can later upgrade to a nice keyboard case. Give me functionality and a faster processor TODAY. Good gift for a clumsy high school or college student on a budget.<br /><br />Not quite the resolution or 'crispness' in graphics you'd expect of a Galaxy Tab or iPad.<br /><br />Passable but I personally don't hire C students.",

            "input": "I purchased this drive to have a shared storage device for our computers, and to share media (music and movies) within our house.     It does what it's supposed to do to a point. If you are running windows, and have their software installed, it seems to be easy enough to use. If you have a Mac, the interface seems to struggle. I have a Linux machine, and the web interface doesn't really work so good, even though it runs on a Linux platform itself. The web interface is basically annoying and somewhat sluggish, walking you through folders and files. What makes me dislike it, is that to get files on to the drive, you have to use a Java applet, which failed under Linux and didn't work right under Mac either. So at that point, you had to drop in files one at a time, which is unnacceptable considering I had some 10,000 music files to load in. Gaining access through a network connection, and using a 'backdoor' approach, you can easily drag in piles of folders and files - but this would be confusing to novice users. I was able to get my files in there no problem that way through both computers, but again, this would not be easy for someone who did not know how to do it. Once files are stored in the drive, the interface again only allows you to 'download' files back out one at a time, unless you use the same approach. So sharing is greatly hindered through the web interface that they expect you to use.    The other part thing that I find confusing, is that in order to log in through the web page, you have to go to Lacie's website, then log in which portals you back to the drive that is sitting under you desk. This would be fine for logging in from the office, etc..., but it's kind of dumb if you're at home and the drive is a few feet away. Ultimately what bugged me the most was how much it was doing on it's own. I watched it when no one was logged in, and none of our home computers were on. It was constantly sending/receiving info on the internet, and writing some kind of info to the drive - not sure if it was logging info or time or what, it does not automatically update or anything like that. If I have a locally shared drive on my home network and I'm not using it, I would expect it to be idle. Last night it was frequently using the internet connection, and you could hear the drive writing, which to me doesn't make any sense.    Overall, it's a nice compact drive, great price, large storage capacity, and really seems to be simple enough to operate from a Windows platform. If you're on Mac or Linux, and know how to connect to 'remote' servers on your network, you can add/remove files easily. Otherwise, the web logging (or whatever it was doing), the flashy user interface, and the random login through [...] made this drive kind of sloppy and slow. I'm not overall against it as a storage device, I would just like something a lot simpler from a technical standpoint.",

Let me start off by saying that I DO HAVE a computer compatible with this card. Well, what exactly do you need to have in order to ensure compatibility some may ask? Well, I honestly wish I could answer that but the fact of the matter is I can't, and neither can Avermedia as they seemingly made a product that they have zero knowledge about. I do not even think the company knows how this card works to its entirety. Avermedia fails to put an emphasis on the REQUIREMENT of native USB 3.0 ports, and this ultimately screws over potential consumers that thought they could get away with an adapter or some expansion slot of some sort. Basically, if your computers lacks native USB 3.0 ports or a compatible motherboard, you're never going to be able to achieve 1080p at 60 frames per second with this card and you most likely won't even get it to reliably work for you. Now, what if your computer does have native USB 3.0 ports, and what if you do have a compatible motherboard and all the other 100 intricacies you seemingly need to have to make this card \\\\\"work\\\\\"? Well....Good luck. The card is a flat out nightmare to handle if you haven't understood where I am getting at. I fail to understand how this card has a single decent review on Amazon, but I'd have to imagine it's people who don't have/know of any reasons to utilize 60 frames per second at 1080p(basically people throwing away money at a high-end card while a card that is 70$ cheaper can do they job they are seeking). Do yourself a favor, look at any reviews on forums or Youtube and you will get the same idea that compatibility and USB 3.0 drivers will be the bane of your existence with this card. How about once you do get the card setup and somewhat \\\\\"working\\\\\"? Once again, good luck! At this point, it is probably the most luck you'll need(as if you didn't need enough luck up until this point).Why? Well, to put it as kindly as I know how; THE SOFTWARE FOR THIS CARD IS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CAPTURE CARD SOFTWARE I HAVE EVER USED AND THE FACT THAT AVERMEDIA ACTUALLY RELEASED THIS GOD AWFUL SOFTWARE IS A TESTAMENT TO THEIR LACK OF RESPECT FOR THEIR CONSUMERS. Now in case that statement in all capitals didn't emphasis it enough, the software is just pure s***(no nice way to put it). Despite their update for the software back in early July, the software is still awful. The presets at higher recording settings are a joke and clearly demonstrate Avermedia's lack of knowledge in the subject, and when you try and run 1080p at 60fps recording, the software will crash, your recording will freeze, and the recording will stutter and just stop working MOST the time. It honestly boggles my mind how such awful software could have been released with a \\\\\"higher end\\\\\" card and it is truly a shame that such awful software comes along with a device that has so much potential in terms of hardware, the only problem is that Avermedia is clueless about the card they developed and it is demonstrated by the amount of time it has taken to come out with more updates to actually make this card usable. If you purchase this card and hope to get high quality streams/recordings...GOOD LUCK.    Oh, and yes, I did contact Avermedia's customer support and I have never heard more confused employees in my life. The customer support clearly has had no training of any sorts in Avermedia's NEW card. It is truly a shame that what could be a great card is plagued by all the issues it has.  Good job Avermedia.

I was going to return it, but I thought that was a shame, because of its good fit and good look, and the other options out there didn't look very good to me, or readily available. So first, I tried to get rid of the smell.  I put the cover, folded open with the Kinlde2 removed and with the interior up, outside in direct sunlight for an entire day, 8AM to 4PM.  And that worked!  That was enough to evaporate and drive off essentially all of the residual glue, or solvent, or whatever.  Now I can stick my nose right up against it and sniff - it smells pretty much like a new glove, with the faintest of chemical undertones; and the smell doesn't transfer to my hand anymore.

I bought this router because i was getting more and more electronics in the house and i have heard about how good this router performs.  Well,  let me tell you, IT IS NOT GOOD.  I have to bridge my verizon router and the nighthawk together, which is no problem.  But the speeds are sooo much lower.  Wired, the speeds are the same as my verizon router, i get about 80/80 with the nighthawk.  Wireless on the other hand is a mess.  I went from getting 50/50 with my verizon router to receiving 30/5 with the nighthawk!  Occassionally i would get 50/50 with my nighthawk, but it is very inconsistent and would drop down o 30/6 most of the time.  KEEP IN MIND, I AM TESTING WIRELESSLY WHILE ONLY BEING 2-3 FEET AWAY FROM THE NIGHTHAWK!  I tried everything humanly possible to get the router to perform normal but it just wont, my wireless speeds are simply not what i wanted.  Ontop of that i contacted Amazon for a refund and they said i cannot return the item because there is nothing wrong wih it!  I a mindblown, JUST SAVE YOUR MONEY!",

It feels solidly built, it protects my kindle, and the light has worked well for me. When I purchased the same case for the new Kindle, I was a little turned off by the fact that it was still at the same price point (still $60 when the Kindle itself was only $79); however, I decided that because the first case was of such high quality that perhaps the price point was still valid. I judged incorrectly. This case feels like a huge step down in quality.  Pros  - Lightweight  - Fits kindle snugly (Perhaps too snugly if you want to remove it on a regular basis.  If you just want to put the kindle in and leave it, the fit is a good thing)  - Centered light provides more even coverage (I've never had a problem with the side light, but I know that it has been an issue for some people  Cons  - Flimsy (The case hardly feels like it is made of leather. It feels almost like cardboard with leather-looking paint sprayed over it. I understand that this contributes to the lightweight quality, but I would have preferred a little more substance for the price. Also, the light mechanism seems as though it could break fairly easily)  - Scratches easily (I've had this case for less than a month and it is already covered in scratches. The Kindle keyboard case looks barely worn after a year of constant use.)  - No closure (This case should have provided some possibility for closing it and keeping it shut. I realize some people may not have liked the elastic, but what about a magnet? The lack of a real closure significantly reduces the ability of this case to keep the kindle protected when not in use)  Overall, this is probably the best case available; this is not saying much and comes from the fact that is the only combined case/reading light I've seen thus far. It might even be better to try to find a sturdier case and buy the light separately, though this seems very inconvenient. If you purchase this product, just know that you are paying a high price and receiving very little in terms of quality.",

The book belongs to the county library not Amazon. This reader was purchased for a child who does not have an Amazon account and does not need one. The screen was difficult to read and the refresh rate was horrible. Any slight touch on the screen cased it to blink, flash and break up.

The result of this is that if you (accidentally or intentionally) turn one of the wheel locks on, and if you try to move the unit, the locked wheel simply BREAKS OFF.  This means it requires only a small amount of pressure when the stand is sitting on low-pile carpet in order to break.  This is just plain bad engineering / product design.  Probably if you had the stand resting on a hard, flat floor, it wouldn't be an issue but I wouldn't trust this on any type of carpet.<br /><br />I bought this simultaneous with a budget Econo Mobile stand to see which I would prefer.  The Econo Mobile stand has no problems at all.  You can lock one or both wheels and move it around all day and the wheels are perfectly sturdy thanks to being encased in plastic all the way around.  I highly recommend that stand over this one.  This stand, although well manufactured, is functionally worthless.",

All information in this review is based on this; I have no experience with any other bluetooth uses for this device.    I spent many many hours trying to get this to work in Vista.  I tried at least 3 different bluetooth driver stacks I downloaded from the internet (some from places I would not visit except in a secure, isolated browser).  I also tried the default Windows Vista stack and countless other things.  I had brief success with various combinations of drivers.    After spending way too much time on this, and reading other reviews, I've concluded that the hardware is faulty.  It doesn't matter what software you load to try to get this to work, the device is not capable of maintaining a bluetooth modem connection reliably.    Thus I have given this device a rating of 1.  Do not buy this item, plain and simple.  It is a waste of money and is incapable of doing its job.",

Unfortunately, not only did this not happen, but I noticed right away my speeds were slower than my older 2.4GHz wifi router by Rosewill! So I decided to perform several speed tests with different devices and connections on both this and my older router. My results were as follows:<br /><br />- My old 2.4GHz router, on all devices tested, showed the same internet speeds as being directly connected to my modem via ethernet. So pretty much no loss from modem through wifi. Considering my internet runs at about 2.5 MB/s downloads, this makes sense because even the shittiest 2.4GHz wifi should have 6.75 MB/s bandwidth.<br /><br />- The Anker N600 should have 37.5 MB/s bandwidth on each frequency band. So obviously my internet is the limiting factor and both routers should show same internet speeds. However, the N600 showed poor performance on both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. 2.4 runs at 1/10 the speed of my old router! 5Ghz showed about 3/4 the speed of old router. The only way to get the same speed was to directly connect my computer to the router via ethernet, but that's not exactly what I bought this thing for. All configurations and positions of devices were replicated in each test.<br /><br />So, yeah, this thing isn't great and all the other reviewers obviously don't know what they are talking about. Actually there is something very suspicious about the 5-star reviews here. They seem to be from the people selling this device because their reviews simply consist of a list of specifications and instructions for setup. Wtf kind of review is that?! I think this is unethical and Amazon should consider investigation. However, it seems Amazon is BEHIND the production and selling of these router so I doubt that will happen.<br /><br />Anyway, spend the extra money and buy a name brand or speed-tested device. I recommend the Asus Gigabit dual band RT-56U. My office has one and the recent firmware added VPN server support which is AWESOME. You can virtually join your network from anywhere and share files. Also it is a very fast router.<br /><br />Making fast network devices isn't easy and Anker is obviously behind on their tech. Maybe in the future they will improve but I don't think I will give them a try again.<br /><br />Just processed my return...",

This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties will work normally under low usage.  However, once their true capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your documents, photos, videos and music will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Good 128GB drives are out there, mostly brand name drives plus a few generics, but their cost is about $35 and up (as of Q3 2015). The lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars. The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is less than $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is less than $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw.

            "input": "From the very first moment I powered it up, the Seagate Central has been absolutely terrible. Without a doubt, it is the worst piece of electronics that I've ever purchased. I can't remember regretting a purchase as much as I've regretted buying my Seagate Central, never more so than right now.<br /><br />About an hour ago, I power cycled my Seagate Central (I'll get into why in a minute). I'd only done this once before, and like last time, I followed all of the manufacturer's instructions. I went on the web interface and stopped all ongoing activities, then unplugged the unit after the shutdown had completed. Again, I was following Seagate's instructions word-for-word.<br /><br />After waiting about 10 or so minutes, I plugged my Seagate Central back in. I assumed that it would go through it's usual start up procedure, just like when I first plugged it in, and just like when I power cycled it before. Except, no. All I got was a solid yellow light on the top of the unit, and a steady beeping sound coming from somewhere inside the case. The disk isn't spinning, the drive isn't working. I want to emphasize that I have never physically moved the unit from the tabletop I set it on when I first plugged it in. It has never been bumped, dropped, or damaged in any way. It has never been subjected to extreme temperatures, just a 70 degree apartment.<br /><br />After searching around the web for a while, I learned that this beeping sound was common among Seagate HDDs. In USB drives, it usually means that the drive isn't getting enough power. This, of course, couldn't be the case for my Central, seeing as it's plugged directly into a wall socket with it's own power adapter. Apart from that, so far as I can tell, I'm essentially screwed. The drive is simply broken and cannot be repaired (at least not by me).<br /><br />This experience was merely the straw that broke the camel's back. My Seagate Central has never, EVER worked as advertised. It took me several days to back up mylaptop (about 260GB of data). It took almost a week to move that backup from my public share folder to my private folder (TWO FOLDERS ON THE SAME DRIVE!!!), which had to be done once I realized that Seagate puts your backup file in your public share folder by default, completely obliterating it's ability to index and share other files in the public folder. Even after I cleared out the public folder, it still takes work to get it to recognize files I've recently added. Usually, I have to stop, then restart UPNP a few times to get it to actually rescan (on two occasions, when that hasn't worked, I've had to resort to power cycling the Central, which apparently can destroy it). Then, there's the Seagate Media App, which is supposed to allow you to access media files in your public share folder from any Android or iOS device with the app. It's a complete JOKE. Even when my phone and my Central are on the same local network, the chances of the Media App working are probably 25%. If you're outside of your home network, forget about it. I've gotten it to work maybe three times, and only for about 5 minutes, after which the app suddenly disconnects from the Central and can never find it again.<br /><br />I consider myself a very, very careful shopper, especially when it comes to electronics. I researched all the different home media NAS units relentlessly, meticulously. The Seagate Central seemed pretty legit. The videos of Seagate employees demoing it at CES and other consumer electronic shows made it seem like a next-gen type of device. I think that's why I'm so upset with my Seagate Central. There's absolutely no reason for a company like Seagate to make a product this bad, and to totally neglect any and all complaints from users. There's absolutely no reason for any consumer electronics product, in this day and age, to be so faulty and unreliable.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying a Seagate Central, do yourself a favor. Go to an ATM, withdraw the money you were going to spend on a Central, then go light it on fire. You'd be getting just as much out of your money doing that as you would buying this NAS, plus you'd be avoiding all the endless frustration and the sinking feeling that you've been totally screwed. I can say with confidence that the Seagate Central is the worst piece of electronics I've ever purchased, maybe even the worst thing I've ever purchased. It was so bad, that even writing this long, angry Amazon review rant hasn't quelled my rage. To do that, I'm going to stop writing this review, get up off my couch, grab my Central, head outside, and then I'm gonna frisbee that sucker as far down my street as I can fling it. I guarantee it'll be the most fun I've had with it ever.<br /><br />*******FAIL********",

I am an adult male, with average sized hands, yet I was simply unable to find a position in which it was comfortable to use this trackball. The included mouse rest is too narrow and uncomfortable, and the way it propped my hand felt very unnatural.    The design of this trackball left my hand \\\\\"hovering\\\\\" over it, as opposed to resting comfortably. I also found manipulating the L/R mouse buttons very awkard, requiring to shift my hand position.    Overall, coming from the Logitech Trackman, I was not able to use this trackball comfortably. It might work for someone with large hands, but it did not work for me. I still gave the 2 stars because of the low price, but other than the price I could not find anything particularly \\\\\"good\\\\\" about it. Maybe the more expensive model would be better (doubtful), but I am not willing to spend more money trying these out.

On the functional side, I discovered quickly that I can't utilize the case fully without compromising it.  Namely, the crease became easily worn out. I'd used the case flatly, just a few times, so that I could handhold the iPad, and by the time I switched it back to the stand mode, the stand wouldn't function properly and my iPad would easily slip from its position (the bump closest to the edge of the case that would provide the lowest viewing angle).  Essentially, the case is not so versatile that it can handle going from a stand to a handheld flat case and back.  Perhaps the nature of the material inhibits it from being so versatile, as it is a pretty stiff leather-like book after all, and like a book, once you fold the cover back from the spine, a crease forms, and that crease can never be undone.  While its design makes it look wonderfully sophisticated, it falls short in functional versatility.  Also, the package comes with a nice pen but there is no holder in the case to hold it.  The plus side is that this is a business that cares about value and provided a good bargain despite this flaws.  I hope the business continues to listen to its customers.  Thank you.",

This product actually gave me a lot more resistance as my mouse tracks closer to the corners of the pad than the usual -- a cable rubbing on my table as my mouse moves closer to the corners of the mouse pad. This product does NOT even come close to giving a cordless experience.<br /><br />I decided to just tape my mouse cord to my wall (40cm behind and below my table -- my table rests against the wall) and it worked great!

If not for it's sturdy build of well-constructed plastic, I'd give it a 1/10.<br /><br />In closing, I feel that these \\\\\"mouse bungee\\\\\" products hold great promise if they can be perfected to provide a cordless experience but when it comes to the Skorpion, it doesn't come even come close to it, you're better off with simple tape.",

I like to take very good care of my electronics and I believe in investing in products to protect them. Unfortunately I have had a hard time finding any type of hard shell case for my laptop. I couldn't find any made by Speck, Otterbox, or any other well known and respectable brand. After reading a lot of great reviews on this product I thought it might be just the thing to keep my laptop from getting all marked up while in use and then I could place the laptop inside a reinforced carrying case or bag when not in use or in transit for protection. It wasn't really what I was looking for but I thought that even if it didn't look really good then maybe at least it would provide some protection while I looked for something a little better. So, I was happy to receive the case today (well before schedule) and now after opening it up I am seething. The packaging the case was shipped in arrived at the office just fine. On the mailing packaging there was no damage, no tears, and no wear so I didn't even open it up to check out the case until I got home from work. The case inside came with each part packaged in a clear bag. Each bag was open at one end. First I pulled out the bottom section of the case. It appeared exactly as described by other reviewers, i.e. vents on the bottom, legs intact. It appeared the correct size but when I tried to fit it onto the bottom section of my laptop it would not line up and fit in place. I had TRIPLE CHECKED that I was purchasing the correct case BEFORE I placed my order. I thought that maybe with the top part in place the bottom might pop in better or at least fit onto the laptop. When I slid the top section of the case out of the bag I noticed that it looked like a line or a crease running across the top section of the case. I just had the lamp on in the room so I thought my eyeswere playing tricks on me. Upon closer inspection the entire top section of the case is warped. I was wondering if maybe this is something that happened in transit when I noticed that on one of the corners the paint was all scratched off and scuffed. It looks like somebody dropped it on a concrete floor and then stuffed it inside the unsealed plastic bag. Besides the damage the item itself looks cheap, cheap, cheap and very tacky. For the price I wasn't expecting anything super high quality but I also wasn't expecting such a rip-off. I just paid $20 for two thin, flimsy, and flexible pieces of plastic - one which is damaged and the other which doesn't fit correctly. I am definitely disappointed and really ticked off about this. The pictures shown here on the Amazon website by this seller do not look like the item that I recieved. I have already sent an e-mail to the seller about returning it for a refund. The lowest rating that I have every given to a purchased item before this was something like 3 or 4 stars out of 5. If I could give this item a -5 star rating then I would do it without batting an eyelash. Sorry for the repetitiveness in this review I am ticked.",

The majority of the keys are no longer functional (making it impossible to use with the few letters that still register). I've been praying that it will just fix itself somehow because the case itself is so cute. But after another month of not being able to use it at all, I can safely say even that appeal has worn off.

I have discovered that the problem was actually the wireless mouse I was using (a LogiTech V450) and not the USB hub. I found that beside the mouse erratically losing it's connection, the external drive was also intermitently disconnecting to my computer (a MacBook.) This caused havoc with Time Machine, OS X's automatic backup.  In researching that problem I learned that sometimes Airport, the Mac's WiFi utility, can interfere with USB connections. That I started me thinking about the wireless mouse. I have now switched to a Belkin mini-mouse plugged into the USB hub, and all the USB issues have disappeared.",

While some would go away over time, that is a silly requirement for a film that you have to look through in the meantime, and for which there will invariably be permanent spots.

I tried several different firmwares before finally getting ahold of the latest one (1.028).    This firmware is alittle more stable than any of the others.  It still causes the unit to drop connections about 1 every 3-4 hours.  Wireless signal is strong but also degrades over time.  The gigabit ports work s advertised and I have used them to test data thorughput from a NAS server to another Server.  It plugs away with no problem until about the 3-4 hour mark when the unit itself disconnects and goes through a reset process.    I was surprised that the firmware itself is very basic and does not include any capability to see devices connected to it via another gigabit switch.  My DLink 655 has no problem seeing the MAC and allows me to to assign a static DHCP address by selecting the MAC/Computername.  NOT so with the Netgear.  You have to manually add this thrugh a sub menu choice.  Apparently there is a beta firmware out that UK residents are using that works, I haven't seen it yet so can't comment on it.

Otherwise, it is somewhat problematic and I think it should not be your first choice for a keyboard. First and foremost, the wire is unusually short. I have a desk with a pull-out keyboard ledge. The cable is so short that I couldn't plug it in normally (through the ledge, under the desk, and plug in from the rear) but had to attach it over the top from the front. I sometimes move keyboards to the desk extension (the short leg of an L-shaped desk) if I need to work on paper at the same time, and the wire doesn't stretch that far so I can't use the extension. It's difficult to work on papers because that over-the-desk cable gets in the way, and if I'm not even using the computer and just need to do other work on my desk, the cable is still in the way. It's a big annoyance.<br /><br />Even more of an annoyance is that the labels on the keys began wearing off after just a few months. I type a lot, but this is the first time I've ever experienced such a thing in all my years using a keyboard, even back to the days of typewriters! Since I am a touch typist (90 wpm), I rarely look at the keys and have managed for the most part without any labeling, but it's just plain weird. As other reviewers stated, the keyboard is unusually cramped and gets uncomfortable after a while. I do not recommend this keyboard unless you have no other options.",

However the adapter for attaching this lamp onto the Kindle Touch (2011) is absolutely inferior, insufficient, falls off, and scratches the back of the Kindle. Not good at all.   The adapter ruins this product's usage, for this model of Kindle. The product page advertises compatibility, so this was a very misleading experience.  The adapter, however, is not needed for all other Kindle models.   You should find out if your model fits the lamp's main clip natively or not, before you think of buying this lamp. We cannot be sure which models fit natively, that info is not on the product page, at the time of this writing.  The actual lamp is well-designed, and the main clip might serve many readers very well.   DETAILS:  This is a great lamp, well-designed, well-packaged, great illumination (low and high setting), and looks and feels very solid. It attaches using an adjustable clip. ...Think of a gentle vice grip, with an internal spring which lets you widen the \\\\\"clamp\\\\\" as needed.   For a thicker Kindle or e-reader, this lamp's main clip design looks like it would be great... if your Kindle model fit natively.  Unfortunately, none of that holds true for the Kindle Touch (2011 model). This lamp comes with only a plastic, U-shaped adapter, to attach to that model.   CONCLUSION:  This adapter defeats everything good about the lamp, and makes this an unstable and cheap afterthought, by contrast to the original lamp design. The adapter does not fit the top of the Kindle well. It does not even attempt to \\\\\"click\\\\\" in. Was not designed to stay on.  Looks like a great design for thicker Kindles or readers, maybe five stars for them.   However I can hardly give even two stars for this lamp -- and I wish the U-shaped adapter was clearly explained on the product listing -- or better yet, re-designed and proven to work to an acceptable level.   In fact, if they re-manufactured this lamp to reallyfit the Kindle Touch (2011), I would absolutely give it a try, because the lamp seems great, it just cannot properly attach to this model.   Next time I buy a Kindle lamp accessory, I will have to wear my Three-Wolf Moon T-shirt, to ensure supreme excellence on every level.  NOTE:   This adapter is supplied in the package, just in case the purchaser has a Kindle Touch (2011) model, even though it does not attach well at all.",

I tried on several different networks, and the connection was either absent or only one bar, even when standing right next to the router with another device that was clocking in normal download and upload speeds. I called Lenovo customer support for a repair, and they immediately shipped me a box to send off the device. I was a bit pleased with their promptness. However, upon receiving the device, I could tell that they had done nothing to take care of the device's environment, as my Thinkpad was so cold that I could barely touch it and had to wrap it in a blanket to warm it up. I have had a computer and TV delivered in the middle of January and neither had a problem with being cold like that. And this was late October/early November that I had sent off my device for repair.<br />Once it warmed up, I charged it and turned it on. The internet was working, apparently network card issues are common with this device. After I reached the desktop, the screen went black and flashed to the login screen. I thought that was weird, but kept going without any interference for about an hour. Then, the tablet did this screen thing again and again until its screen was constantly flashing on and off. This caused the tablet to crash at least five times that night, the night I FIRST had the tablet back from repair. Needless to say, I was frustrated and decided to let it rest overnight.<br />The next day, the tablet started working fine before repeating the problem. I refreshed the computer and reinstalled Windows, and still the problem persisted. For some reason, I kept thinking the problem would go away, so I kept holding on to the device in hopes that time would heal my Thinkpad. After a week of this frustrating problem, it stopped. For a week, I never experienced the screen black out and turn to the login screen like I had previously. I thought I was right and the problem went away. However, after snapping a couple pictures one day, the problem came back. At first, the screen time out was once maybe every 10 minutes or so, before it progressed to a constant flash by the end of the day. Again, I tried refreshing the PC, reinstalling Windows, and everything else I could think of to solve the problem, to no avail. The computer crashed several times, so much so that it drained the battery life.<br />With finals coming up, I really needed this tablet to perform at optimum level. I should not have so many problems within only two months of having the device. I called Lenovo to ask for another repair. They sent me a box, however you do not get any sort of confirmation via email, text, or anything with the information regarding your repair with them until they are ready to ship it back to you. Thus, I had to call back to get the case number, since I didn't think to write it down when the guy quickly read it off to me. The servers of course happened to be down that day, so they could not tell me. When I called back the following business day (because that is when I was told the refund staff would be available), I was told that a representative from this department would call me back within 24-72 hours. Since the 72 hours fell on this past Thanksgiving day, I gave them until Friday to reach me. No one has called and it is now Sunday. I am calling tomorrow to demand a full refund, and again will never buy another Lenovo product. This device is absolutely terrible and gimmicky, which is sad, because it is so amazing in concept. I was really looking forward to a Windows 8 tablet with a stylus, and now struggle to find something comparable without emptying out the bank account (this is already a high-price tablet to begin with).<br /><br />On the note of the stylus, it wasn't that great anyway. It has no eraser (which makes writing on pdf's annoying if you make mistakes), and can get horribly off sometimes (by an inchor so) if you either move your finger to the screen while using the pen or hold it at an angle. At the edges of the screen, the pen detection is typically quite off. Maybe it's too soon for the technology of a stylus with Windows, but I did really enjoy being able to both highlight and annotate my research papers, as well as draw diagrams, etc. on them.",

I had a concern about the case not having a built-in screen protector but you really cant wish for everything. The exposed screen makes me slightly uneasy but you can easily remedy that with a screen protector.<br />The typing positions are VERY stable, even though it doesnt seem so! Theres no clicking mechanism, the two positions just utilize the friction between the rubber of the case and the inside fabric of the cover, it is more stable than you'd think, I was very pleased when typing away on the iPad's screen.<br />Something that is usually underrated, there is a tiny groove on the right side for you to put your finger through when you want to open the case, the designers did put an effort into making this a good experience for the user. There were even markings on the inside of the cover to point out where you should position your iPad. Little details matter.<br />The 'grippy' case makes it suitable for any surface, and even carrying it feels great. The only problem is that it will make it quite irritating to shove in your backpack with your books, the rubber makes it difficult to slide between books, so I wouldnt recommend this to students who usually take their ipads to university.<br /><br />EDIT: I reduced the rating to ONE star due to the extreme difficulty I had just to REMOVE the case. I wanted to take it out of the case and what a pain that was, I hurt my hands just trying to get it out! Also, the wobbly stand ALWAYS falls off whenever you pick up the ipad, making it incredibly awkward and it doesnt look good when you are out in a coffee place or class. The fact that there is no built-in screen protector let it collect a LOT of dust and smudges. For this price you can get a case with a built-in screen protector.<br />Bottom line: good first impression, bad on the long run. Not recommending this to anyone.. Not recommending this to anyone.",

HOWEVER, take note of the following regarding use with the SP3 (i7): There are no openings for the speakers at all - the leather completely covers the speakers! The top of the case does have holes intended for venting, but they are not positioned correctly: They sit flush against the side of the SP and do not touch the SP vents. With the i7 version and doing CPU intensive tasks, this causes problems considering the rest of the SP is also snuggled in leather. As a smaller downside, the keyboard cannot be folded underneath the SP3 along with the case front - ergo, you must remove the keyboard if you want to use in &#34;tablet&#34; mode. Last but not least, the keyboard cannot be locked into the propped up elevated position (as shown in the picture). The leather lips used to secure the SP block the magnetic anchor points needed to lock the keyboard up. They could of solved this by putting an additional set of magnets on the leather lips, but they didn't. These are the only downsides I observed with what &#34;could&#34; be an awesome product!",

I tried Firefox and unlike Chrome, it allowed me to a alter the ppp un and pw, but it wouldn't stay altered. That seemed to indicate the browser did influence the process, so I re-activated MS IE. Literally, in a few minutes the modem was setup and has been working perfectly for a day now.<br />I'm using Win 8.1 64bit and it's just possible that that might make a difference, Microsoft products being what they are....<br />In any case, I give this modem failing marks on 2 counts: 1) that this kind of problem exists in the first place; 2) that nowhere in the Centurylink or Actiontec webpages or tech &#34;help&#34; assistance is there any mention of the browser influencing things.

The Ipad 2 fits into this case very snuggly...too snuggly.  Once you have it in, you have a VERY hard time taking it out.  Who needs that?  Compare this to a Leather Yoobao case.  The Yoobao fits snuggly, yet maintains the ability to insert and remove the Ipad from the case easily.  The Belkin's material makes it difficult to remove the Ipad from the case. Once you do have the Ipad inserted, their are holes in the proper places to access the buttons, port and headphone.  But here again, the access with the Yoobao style case is much better.      The Belkin keyboard paired and worked well.  You could cut and paste with dedicated keys.  You can also turn the music on and off, turn the volume up and down with dedicated keyboard keys  (much like the Apple Wireless Keyboard.  The Apple Wireless Keyboard is compact, yet is more spacious than the Belkin.  The space of the keys on the Apple Wireless Keyboard are layed out about one inch wider and 3/8 inch taller.        You have to wonder, why it isn't better to use a Yoobao leather case which maintains the thinness and lightness of the Ipad 2, and just buy an Apple Wireless Keyboard.  It is true that this would leave you with 2 items to carry...but it allows you to take advantage of the light thin attribute of the Ipad 2, and have a better keyboard when you need it.  With the Belkin, you may have the keyboard attached at all times, but the Ipad is heavier, about 2 1/2 times thicker than with another case (like Yoobao)and rather awkward to unfold.      While this is a nice beta try by Belkin, I would pass.",

I wish I listened to the voice in my head saying, \\\\\"Hmm, this doesn't seem very sturdy,\\\\\" when I took it out of the box, but I instead used it as planned for housing files I need at home and at the digital lab that I use for work. As another reviewer observed, this hard drive had an annoying spontaneous ejecting habit. My real problem was when it imploded - with a backup in progress - after less than 2 months of use. It was functioning normally one minute and then the drive's light started blinking and my computer was unable to recognize it. We tried the drive in another enclosure and hooked to a linux computer that usually will recognize even corrupted drives. Nothing.  The data recovery lab I ultimately sent it to had to replace multiple \\\\\"physically damaged\\\\\" components to restore functionality and found more than half of the data was in fact corrupted. Mind you, this drive had never been dropped and travelled primarily in a protective camera bag.  Call me crazy, but I think that a drive billed as \\\\\"ultra-portable\\\\\" should be able to withstand a few weeks of regular desktop use and the occasional commute.  Do not recommend.      Note:  I have a few older Seagate external hard drives (different models) that I've used for 1-2 years without incident. I've travelled extensively with them and had nothing but good things to say. That's why I went with Seagate on this one. I might even have been able to forgive the company its obvious construction and quality departure on this line but for the nightmarish customer service experience I had with Seagate after the drive crashed. Suffice it to say, I've sworn off Seagate products indefinitely.",

However, I wasn't able to make it very far since most Dell monitors do not have a service tag on them. It's even started directly on Dell's site, most monitors don't have service tags. If that's the case, why is a service tag required in order to start a chat session? So, I decided to pick up the phone and contact their support, figuring a human can get around this nonsense. I called and had to sit on hold for about 45 minutes. I started to get a bit frustrated since the whole time sitting on hold I kept trying to troubleshoot the issue myself without success. Finally, a soft spoken female answers the phone and asks me for my service tag. I let her know that it's a monitor I'm calling about and they do not have service tags. I proceeded to tell her about the issue I'm having and the phone started to make sounds and eventually disconnected me. I was not going through another 45 mins hold session with this crappy tech support. Dell is way too big of a company to have technical support that is this bad. They have plenty of links to contact a sales rep all over their site, but you have to dig and dig and dig to locate tech support, wait on hold for close to an hour, to only be disconnected. Please note that this review is mainly for the service that I received, which is the package deal when purchasing this semi-expensive monitor.

I solely bought it to use it as a home/office machine thinking i would use it with a docking station on external monitors in office and as a laptop at home. While i have not yet tried it on external monitor yet, just using it as a laptop was a terrible experience. Keyboard is made of solid metal making it really heavy. I also have a 12\\\\\" fujitsu Core I7 laptop at home all possible ports integrated and much thicker than ativ but its much lighter.<br /><br />As i mentioned, everything looks too small on ativ and changing the resolution made characters blurry. Touch responsiveness is good and so is the pen. I bought it to do a lot of pdf reading and possible annotations where necessary using the pen, taking notes in meetings and have all my work related stuff at one place whether at home, office or a conference. Holding the tablet alone in portrait is awkward. Just too long. Width fit pdf's were too small to read. In landscape mode, character size was great but since height is not much, only a small part of the page was displayed. I am also test driving the galaxy note 10.1 and while it is also kind of too wide, its less wide and lighter than ativ. I have despised windows 8 so far. May be i will like it if i learn it more but i find windows 7 more user friendly. In desktop mode, when you touch on a field where you want to type, the keyboard does not automatically appears. I have to manually enable/disable the screen keyboard through the keyboard icon at the bottom. This may have to do with some setting but this is the default setting i am talking about. I tested the WIDI on ativ 700t and it worked great while playing a youtube video. There was probably a lag of less than one second but connection was clear and stable.<br /><br />I like windows and android tablets more and hate ipads especially due to lack of memory card and other slots, just okay camera, no widi etc. However, i must admit that as a tablet, the aspect ratio and size of Ipads are the best. I dont know why samsung and other companies are making these things wider and wider. I just saw some new tablet with an aspect ratio of 21:9 which is ridiculous.<br /><br />My ativ is going back. I will wait for a better sized hybrid tablet/computer with digital pen before buying again. Or may be soon enough ipad will come with a digitizer pen and despite being an android/windows fan, i would go for the ipad with pen just for its aspect ratio.",

After using this drive as the source drive for some video editing work, the drive shut down by itself, and is now making a clicking sound and will not turn on.

The disk has an airgap between the bottom classes and is isolated using 3 support pads with poor thermal contact. Rather than using some thermally conductive sil padding, to improve thermal performance, they just used these 3 poorly placed pads .<br /><br />I am sure I violated the warranty and cannot get an RMA now since I opened it, but given the poor design quality I would not trust their products with my data anyways.

It was all plastic and clear, nothing like the sleek design of the Intuos or Bamboo tablets. I don't use it anymore, but you know what? I could if I wanted to. I could use that tiny Graphire because it still works. Unlike the Intuos 4 and Intuos 5s I have bought within the last year and a half. As an animation student, having a tablet is absolutely essential. I can't do any work what-so-ever without one and Wacom is supposed to be the top of the line in this area. However both products I have bought, most recently the Intuos 5, have struggled with USB port issues.<br /><br />I bought my Intuos 5 back in April of THIS YEAR. The USB port stopped working in MAY. That is absolutely ridiculous! I was only lucky that I had already finished all of my school work! I sent it off to be fixed, and it was. I couldn't use it for two months though because I had work where i couldn't use my tablet. So I have been using my Intuos 5 for approximately a month and now its broken AGAIN. Its on September! How is that even possible?? Does anyone at this company even know what they are doing?<br /><br />My answer is yes. The people at customer service are kind, and make sure you have everything you need to get it sent in and fixed. But after that? Down the line? Obviously something is out of whack. I just called customer service again to get help and it turns out the serial number for this one is different than my old Intuos 5. Which means that Wacom didn't even send MY tablet back. They sent me some other poor schmuck's tablet that doesn't work either.<br /><br />I don't even know what to say about this product. It works really, really well. WHEN IT WORKS. However that won't be very often, now will it?<br /><br />So lets see. If you don't mind having to take 2 week breaks every few months to send this thing out for repairs, then I say go ahead. I completelyrecommend this tablet. But if you need consistancy and your lively hood depends on the Intuos actually performing well for a long time? I say search elsewhere or buy used. DO NOT waste your money to buy this new and have it crap out on you every few months. You deserve more than that.",

One has to pull it up and out and reposition the rubber silacon constantly, it os bvery annoying and just should not happen.<br /><br />If your looking for something that protects your ipad in an earthquake this would probably be the case for you.  However, it does add significant weight to the ipad and it totally removes the overall ipad experience you once had using a thinner case.  The bulk is substantive, and it covers much of the ipad borders, unlike the Otter, which is what I went back to after returning this one.  despite the minor flaws the Otter is definitely a superior case overall, much lighter and has less an intrusive presence than the Gum Drop.",

It has erratic movement of the pointer when used on my desk surface. Microsoft support tells me that will happen on a reddish brown colored surface. So now I have to use a mouse pad which defeats the purpose of using a wireless mouse.  <br /> <br />2. I like to keep a PS/2 mouse connected also. Having the PS/2 connected with my older wireless caused no problem. Now with the Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 connected, I have different tracking speeds between the two. When I adjust the Wireless 6000 to the pointer speed I want, the PS/2's speed is very slow, about half the speed. In other words, the PS/2 has to travel twice the distance as the Wireless 6000 to move the pointer the same distance.  <br /> <br />Sooo, I'm back to the battery eating mouse.",

I have another Samsung i7 laptop that's been great the Ultra has been nothing short of a nightmare that keeps getting worse. I Talked with best buy who sold it to me they gave me full trade in credit after almost 2months. I bought a dell xps12. it is the best Ultra book in my opinion. It will be a very long time before I ever buy another Samsung ANYTHING. There customer support is horrible their quality and execution is poor at best. Samsung has problems with ultras returning from sleep also they lock the bios down and installed windows key making upgrading nearly impossible with a disk if you can believe that. Also their tech support tells people that you void your warranty when adding a SSD oh by the way you have to replace the motherboard and keyboard to fix both problems the bios lock down and software non compatibility and the sleep problem. the ultra is not compatible with Intel 520series SSD.I can only tell you how difficult this has been. Samsung's website states you don't void your warranty when you change the hard drive. Maybe Samsung can learn to teach their employees how to properly handle service calls. Maybe Samsung can even decide next time to not try to market anything that has this many problems until they can make it right. The best advise I can give is return them while you still can and get a Dell xps12, Acer, asus, lenova one of PC magazines top ten ultra list that Samsung doesn't make it on. I was very surprised how many samsung's are broken right out of the box this reminds me of GE televisions in the 80's 70 percent failure rate out of the box.

Pretty cumbersome to make it usable, but now after hours of tinkering this one works OK too with tap scrolling, capability to use landscape and portrait modes, etc.    However, there's one thing that's not going to make this thing a keeper for me. Display quality! All the geeks on the net were drooling about the resolution on this thing, being higher than iPhone, iPod Touch etc. But the resolution is not all! I think, the problem with N800 display is back-light. It's not spread out evenly. Some portions of the screen is lighter than others. That's why it's hard on your eyes. Anyhow, a text looks a bit blurry. That's a killer for me. I think it's actually a systemic problem for Nokia. I saw n95 phone, which had the same problem. I can make comparison with the displays on iPod Touch and Palm TX. Ipod Touch may have a lower resolution, but, boy, how nice it is to read internet pages on that one. I can't wait till Apple loosens its tight grip on the software and people can create e-book readers for this thing. Palm TX has actually a pretty good display - not that bright as N800, or iPod Touch, however I read some 100 books on it and had no problem at all. And both iPod Touch and Palm TX have smaller screens than N800. Today, when you can see gorgeous Samsung screens oncheap $100 phones, it's not acceptable for Nokia to save money on their displays. For $200 I paid for it, I still keep it till a something better comes around, then this brother goes straight to eBay.",

This is not my first tablet, I have both a Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 and a Le Pan TC 970. After delivery I charged it overnight and added an 8gb SD card. I was pleasantly surprised after boot-up that the tablet had so few already-installed apps - I like to add my own to purpose it for my needs. It also felt great in my hands - substantial and just the right size between my other two tablets. It was nice to have the HDMI port and I hooked it up and it looked great on my HDTV (using pre-loaded HDMI switch app). Pretty good so far.<br /><br />I checked out the Pandigital-branded GetJar Store (it's just a loader for the mobile website) and was unimpressed with the selection though I did install a few apps to see how it worked (Dolphin Browser HD, Skype, GO Launcher EX, Shazam, Maps by Google, Gmail by Google, Solitaire Free, VLC Direct, Mini Piano Lite, Google+, Google Voice, etc.  - mostly older versions). I also added Amazon Appstore,  SlideME Market and 1 Mobile Market and apps from all of them along with side-loading my core apps (AVG, Keepass, Dropbox, Pandora, Last FM, Jamendo, Google Talk, etc). I also side-loaded an older Android Market from Google (no rooting required) but it didn't show very many compatible apps for me.<br /><br />Things started slowing down at this point and running apps in the background kept getting me the low-memory and low on space notifications. I started moving apps to the SD but all of a sudden it wouldn't recognize the SD card. I checked the Settings-SD and it was still there so I unmounted it and re-mounted it - same problem. I then tried unmounting, removing, reinserting, mounting and it was back. (by the way it was a b?#@h to mount and unmount with my fat fingers) This continued to happen, generally after the tablet went to sleep and I unlocked it but could happen in any long session accessing the SD card.<br /><br />Eventually, it would not recognize the SD card at all. I conclude there is a problem with the SD socket on this device. The other problem (low memory/out of space) tells me that 256MB ram and 2GB flash memory is much to restrictive for use as a general tablet, even with an external SD card. I consistently had under 40MB ram available and no space left on the internal flash.<br /><br />My conclusion is that it does not qualify as a general-use tablet (for me at least) but might work as a dedicated e-reader (if you don't carry too many books on it) with occasional internet forays or occasional game/multimedia use (if you don't use memory-intensive apps).<br /><br />We'll see what the warranty service is like and I'll update at a later date if warranted.entually, it would not recognize the SD card at all.

I was looking for a netbook replacement, wanted a little bigger screen and more resolution without losing portability (size and weight) advantages of the netbook.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this unit. The ability to turn off the touchpad without two hands on the keyboard, 4G memory, big hard drive (though I planned to replace it with a 7200 I have in hand), adding Bluetooth (though I really have no need), VGA and HDMI out. Home Premium 64 (that is to say, anything but Starter is a plus).<br /><br />Sadly, she's going back.<br /><br />1) Upper left corner of the bezel is warped out. Just enough to get a business card in, but darn it, it should be perfect out of the box.<br /><br />2) It would never connect to my N router at higher than 65mbps. Finally got around to searching on the card, to check if I had the latest drivers. Well folks, this is a single-band card, so that's all you get. 2.4 only. So really, G wifi plus a little. Welcome to 2002. Not acceptable when my other laptops all connect at 150 or 300. OK, it doesn't affect the internet connection, but doing backups or working with files on my NAS is at half-speed or worse compared to everything else.<br /><br />Shame on HP for using those cards. Lame.<br /><br />3) I was really expecting a snappier experience moving from an Atom 270 w/ 2GB ram to an E450 with 4. I think the E450 would do much better with a larger cache.

But I was able to get most of the apps I wanted, especially with side-loading. I would have given the HD 4 stars, 5 considering it's price. But since the upgrade, every app that is run anywhere always shows up in the carousel. I can live with that, by ignoring the carousel, and using the app and book entries on the top bar. But not all the apps show up in the app list. And the new Kindle system software takes up more storage space, so I had to remove half my books, or I could not update any of the applications. If I knew this would happen, I would have spent the extra money for a real tablet.<br />The Kindle HD is a great reading device; you can read ePubs and Nook, magazines, and Kindle books.

            "input": "I own 3 Macbook Pro's and a Macbook 13 inch (white). All bought 1.5 to 2.5 years ago except the Macbook 13 inch which I got a year ago for my youngest daughter and has a battery I wish my pro had in a computer that is half the price! That little battery lasts 8 hours and came out about a month after I picked up the 3 pros with total clunker batteries that last 3 (supposedly 4) hours--Apple always does this to me- got me this time with an iPod Touch giveaway with purchase of the Macbook Pro-that is the giveaway a new model is soon to follow so WAIT DON\\\\\"T BITE on the deal. So all the pro batteries for the larger- 15 and 17 inch lines should be recalled and its a disgrace IMHO that this is actually being resold with many people having to buy one every year-check out Apple's own reviews for those who doubt this on the Apple site under the same battery model number.    My daughter's similar 15 inch battery failed within 2 months and cycle count was below what is minimum to be declared functional (according to the tech at APLCARE who replaced it and sent it without asking for old one back first--what you expect when you buy a top of line laptop that cost more than double its winblows competitor -fortunately when you are within warranty Apple treats you respectfully.   However, I felt like Rodney Dangerfield 2 days ago after 2 hours of futile gripes and pleas of outrage (I have worked designing embedded systems for 25 years and so I know when an item is a failure vs. a wear and tear issue)!  My 17 inch macbook pro and my wife's BOTH failed within the same week! Precisely when the option to pick up APLCARE for my Macbook expired a month or so earlier and I checked on the prices of replacing the whole shebang and at 1199 it seemed with 3 what -maybe ONE would fail--I could buy a whole other Macbook for price of 3 Aplcare contracts! This seems to be reason customer service really decided they hated me-I made the comment-a sin-but with 3 of them its hard to not think its cheaper to pool the 3 times 300 bucks in self insurance and have enough to almost buy a new Macbook if not a Pro at current prices.     My battery, this same one you will be buying to replace your old one is the same defective dangerous jiffy pop battery that failed you before and will fail you again in a year or so.... not only puffed open to a whopping 4 inch thick flat out pried open looking battery -it leaked brown battery acid into the housing of the battery case, which sits adjacent to your RAM interface (slot where you can add more memory) and it almost destroyed the entire computer power system in addition to potentially causing a fire. I can not for the life of me understand with the Apple site rife with 100s of similar gripes (and this is what gets screened by apple) on their review of same battery how Apples' VP of customer support can show his face in public.    I wrote a review after becoming so infuriated that customer care was initially going to replace at least my insanely mutant battery and then abruptl stated NOPE WE WONT-sorry never said we would! Oh and this is recorded so don't say we did say we were going to replace it and they are not defective-this is normal for a failing battery to expand and pop out of your laptop 3 times its size like the incredible hulk.  My review on APPLE site, Indicating that I was ready to try and band together people interested in filing a class action law suit against Apple for this insanely stupid customer service cheap out no doubt never made it to their site so I figured maybe it would be therapeutic to vent to other poor souls who are paying to replace this-some blessed few are getting free ones but its a crap shoot apparently.   I was so angered by the vitriolic customer support rep. and his totally condescending attitude-he basically asked me if I HAD PICTURES OF THE ACID I CLAIMED LEAKED As if I was making it up- I said I have two bulging batteries like this and I say this is clearly a defect not wear and tear--Isay what are odds 3 Macbook Pros all have battery fails--apparently the \\\\\"gentleman\\\\\" Never took probability and statistics as for 3 batteries bought randomly by the same household to fail on each battery and their not be a defect places odds of about \\\\\"NO WAY\\\\\" that one person winds up with 3 failing batteries. He said, I probably was just unlucky and claimed to not have heard of many bulging battery issues (this with the Apple site full of reams of customers all citing the bulge battery issue--it literally grows and pops out of the frame and will not fit back in. THey seem to expect Apple users to  be monitoring battery issues via diagnostics like checking one's oil or tire pressure--get real apple these are consumer laptops not Crays. I offered to mail them the battery and accept a replacement after they verified the truth of my statements but they just found a way to deny me by acting like I was uncooperative in not letting someone \\\\\"Take a look\\\\\" at my Mac-which could of course wind up costing me installation fees as well as repair fees-been there and done this with 2 hard drives on a Powerbook.  Not only is this battery functionally non-functional, its potentially dangerous and likely to break your computer as it also starts power cycling down your notebook over and over when the failure begins to manifest....an audible pop finally was noticed and that is when I realized this thing was dangerous and as I felt the battery and noticed why my laptop was propped up as if floating above the table, the heat was close enough to recall the earlier MAC power brickes that literally lit ablaze-why is it Apple muffs its batteries all the time then will not recall them--just like the iPhone Consumer Reports issue on call drops--it shows a total arrogance developing at a once earnest and hard working little company that came back from dead with a visionary leader who seems to have gotten lost in his own success,  So, I could not even power cycle mine on with the battery pulled out--maybe the acid that was leaked into the casing that i had to wipe out was glitching something--I could not boot to the hard drive and fortunately was able to firewire in to the laptop as a remote hard drive and salvage my iTunes and photos which I stupidly had not checked in time machine to back up. Fortunately i remembered I had bought a terabyte backup drive and run Time Machine backup just about a week before this failure and once I bought a new battery I was able to restore the Macbook pro by wiping my hard drive (which nodes had somehow become fubar) and recopying the music back from an old iMac that I use basically also as a redundant memory store.    On my wife's, battery failure--I was already checking on it and she (who had made fun of me claiming mine failed as I do not care well for my items) as hers too became a jiffy pop battery that bulged out of its frame....but we yanked it right away and she could run with power cord alone til new crappo 2006 made battery came in mail--another 270 bucks to Apple for their defective batteries-agida.    The thing that is really becoming disgusting about APLCARE is they still are charging 275 or 350 for a computer that costs about 1500 with extra memory and stuff I added on like video graphics upgrade more memory etc. at time I bought these they were over 2k each- you would expect a customer who buys 4 Macbooks (3 of them pros) to get a fair shake with a battery 4 inches wide and brown acid leak but guess what--they made me feel like I was an idiot who should have been checking the battery and known to replace it long ago!  Still, I am guaranteeing that it is unlikely they would have replaced the batteries even under APLCARE as they would likely say 2 years is beyond the wear and tear warranty. THey pulled similar stunt on the Powerbook displays which had a \\\\\"pinch\\\\\" problem where simply touching the LCD in the corner cracked the entire 17 inch display and APLCARE split out screen coverage AFTER THE FACT and started selling supplemental display care coverage for 130 above and beyond the 275 for basic care.     My wife's Macbook pro  on board diagnostic still claims the battery works and is in \\\\\"fair\\\\\" condition but their Do it yourself dept. where the hoveled masses who do not buy overpriced APLCARE contracts get sent to purgatory to deal with the nastiest supervisors known to techland--tells me the cycle count shows it is worn out -so apparently the diags is an optimistic program.    The DIY customer care rep SUPERVISOR-the little guy told me he could never get authority to give me a replacement- \\\\\"DAVE\\\\\" told me that its normal for batteries to bulge and leak when they are old ( 2 years )--Dave tells me laptop batteries are similar to those Duracell  \\\\\"AA alkalines will do that\\\\\"-tell me, is this the same company with the \\\\\"genius bar' at the store? A lithium 130 dollar battery is prone to leak acid after its cycled out and its normal for it to bust open, leak, and grow 3 times its original width?      Bottom line is if you read reviews--if you take it into the store and show a grossly damaged battery -wave it around make a bit of noise you are likely to be quietly handed a replacement -after all it does not look good to prospective buyers to see a battery that looks like godzilla-but any poor soul who is disabled or can not get to the Apple store gets the shaft. They have a random policy generator--if you tell Apple that they have a defective battery that should be recalled you are placed on the naughty customer list and given nothing for your wise alec complaints! NO SOUP FOR YOU! THey seem to have contracted the SOUP NAZI tech support company!     Not having the time or energy to spend perhaps another 2 hours of my time plus driving back and forth, another 2 blood pressure pills and a brown bag to blow into for an anxiety attack to argue yet again, this time perhaps with a \\\\\"genius.\\\\\"  I resign myself to be shafted and fork over my 270 bucks to the newest evil empire replacement andrealize I now dislike Apple as I did MSFT in the early 90s. Say it aint so Steve?    It continues to confound me how a company with cult like following abuses its cult worshipers--and count me among the fans--yet it is classic cult leader behaviour to begin to abuse ones followers. I guess Old Steve Jobs Prednisone is making him crankier as steroids are wont to do and making his need for greed grow even more as he realizes he has  the only decent desktop, consumer oriented laptop in town....man its MSFT 2.0.     Who would expect this from a company smart enough to come up with the iPhone, iPod, run Linux and lose old long in tooth MAC OS--I mean the company is genius yet this customer service issue looms large and will make me now always go to the cheapest mac books i can get and those proven to be out for a year without defects.     My daughter's liittle 13 inch macbook has unibody vs. the crappy old screwed in frame on my \\\\\"Pro\\\\\", a minor water or coffee drop spill takes out your keyboard and more likely your whole mac....never ever had a spill break my softy Toshiba's etc. never, you could run them over with a truck and they would boot--it seems Apple will never get to grasp what even enterprise grade much less carrier grade quality means- I laugh picturing the enterprise IT guys going to iPhones and talking about 5 9s reliability--what is that? said the consumer device QA guys....    These batteries are the worst of any on any laptop I have ever owned---3 hours tops life  and you are supposed to download and \\\\\"Calibrate them monthly!\\\\\" give me a break Apple! I just am so miffed after my discussion with their \\\\\"support\\\\\" team that I am sad to say that I am no longer planning to join in with the rest of \\\\\"Heaven's Gate/Mac worshippers\\\\\" when the next Hale Bopp comet passes by!     Did mean to review the battery only but its hard not to describe the entire customer experience that went along with trying to get treated fairly by being given one for free. The worst issue iswe are buying the SAME defective battery again made in the same 2006 dated lot and they will continue to fail in same way over and over-til we buy newer mac models, which I guess is the plan hey? Apologies for the length but this would never get by the moderators on Apple board although its 100 percent true and not opinion--objective reality is that APPLE just does not care about your problems once you punt on APLCARE---its YOUR OWN DARN FAULT! Yeesh...  RedHAT hear I come!",

This did not effect my view of the keyboard at all as you'll see below.<br /><br />Ok, so let me start off with what this keyboard has running for it.<br /><br />-The backlighting is good and i live the scroll wheel concept, its awesome to be able to control the backlight more than on/off<br />-The macro keys are well placed and they are very functional, i am happy with what they do<br />-Letters are clear and they are visible<br />-Placement of the keys are good. I can't stand the british layout but they clearly had good intentions<br />-This keyboard looks GOOD. Let me rephrase that, this keyboard looks good when you only see the bottom of it, the brushed aluminum on the bottom is awesome and i really wish they followed that design throughout the keyboard.<br /><br />The Bad<br />-Macro Keys: There are way too many of them, Its almost like they are there just for Anker to say that we have 20 million macro keys<br />-Design: Other than the metal bottom, aesthetics aren't particularly good, the macro keys look kind of odd, they are unsymmetrical and frankly, the scroll wheel just looks out of place<br />-Feel: Spacebar feels like crap, the keys don't feel much better. When you use the keys, it feels like they are going to get stuck at the bottom. I would say that the keyboard on my dell laptop is much better to type on than this. Furthermore, they keys rattle like no tomorrow and the membrane that Anker used to detect keystrokes isn't particularly accurate.<br />-Quality: Meh, the keys feel really cheap as i said before but the entire thing itself isn't that bad. I would have preffered better build quality on the whole though<br /><br />Final words.<br />Would i recommend this keyboard to a friend? No. I really don't understand what Anker did here. It doesn't make sense that they would put out a keyboard with a British layout in the United States and the quality of the materials they used strikes me as just plain stupid.

There were no customer reviews of the product when I bought them in June so I decided (based on some legit techy reviews) to be one of the first to try the product. I wanted to give the tablets to my boys already set up with their favorite games and books. I fell in love with the tablet as I was setting up the first one - it seemed comparable to some of the higher end tablets and I thought I had a really big score in buying these. However, when I was ready to set up the second tablet (the day before we were celebrating their birthdays), I noticed that it would not turn on most of the time. I literally had to play with it for 10 minutes to get it to turn on. We exchanged that one and within a week, the new one stopped taking a charge. I didn't have the money to replace those tablets with higher quality ones so I've been exchanging them every time they just stop working. We've been through 5 so far and both are currently messed up and in need of exchange. One made it 2.5 months and all of the others died before within a few weeks. It's always one of two problems - the power button doesn't work or it just stops taking a charge. I actually thought my kids were doing something to mess them up - until the guy at Sears told me that they've had a lot of customers returning them for power issues and that he doesn't recommend them. Thankfully I purchased the 2-year warranty on them. I will be returning one Zeki tablet directly to Sears (because it hasn't been 30 days since my last exchange) and the other through the warranty claim company. I'm going to use the money to purchase a Kindle Fire for them to share until I can purchase a second one. The Fire is better suited for their needs (reading books and playing games) and I KNOW that the Fire is a solid product.",

            "input": "(Disclaimer: Please note that this review is for the TX-1000, but mysteriously appears under the TX-2500, which I don't own, and have no experience with. If you read the review, you'll notice that I've mentioned the TX-1000 several times. Some of the issues here might apply to the newer models as well.)    In a nutshell, this was my first ever AMD-based PC. But I can guarantee that it will be the last. It will also likely be my last HP laptop.      When I was on the lookout for a tablet PC, the HP TX-1000 stood out like a Christmas tree in terms of the price. It was less than half of any other tablet PC on the market. So even though HP has absolutely no pedigree in creating tablets (and I'll tell you why shortly) the price alone made for a compelling reason to consider it. The more I looked at it, the more attracted I got to it. Add to that situation the fact that I had very recently acquired an HP desktop, which had totally blown me away with its presentation (especially over Dell). It was so much better (in every possible way) than Dell - at a cheaper price that I started thinking that it was possible that sometimes you did get more than you paid for. I thought HP had once again finally arrived as a serious player in the PC arena.     And then came this HP laptop, very rudely yanking me into the realm of reality. Boy, was I ever mistaken about the company. Did I ever jump the gun on passing a judgment. Was I ever wrong about getting more than you pay for. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this HP laptop jolted me into an extremely rude awakening. I can't say enough about what a HUGE disappointment it was to me.     Speed. First of all, the laptop was just plain slow. It's the slowest computer I have ever used. Ever. It's relatively even slower than the iMac I had some ten years ago (back then, the iMac was - relatively speaking -- the slowest computer I had ever owned, and was annoying enough that I returned it after two weeks of slow running, crashing, and notfinding any software that ran on it). For something that claims to be a using a 64-bit processor and 2 GB of RAM, this laptop crawls slower than a sick turtle. After a few weeks of tweaking around, I found the reason for that - the AMD Turion and HP's sorry excuse of a motherboard. My venerable Dell m700 (with Celeron and 1 GB of RAM) easily outperformed this manifestation of lethargy in any number of performance tests and I/O benchmarks that I had created (from real-life scenarios in which I was using both the laptops). So then, I came to the conclusion that the only reason HP was selling AMD was so that it could sell a tablet PC for half the price of its competitors.    Wireless. The second reason for relentless vexation was the wireless card. It would just randomly stop working every now and then, and would never work again until I rebooted the laptop. I called HP and had the card replaced. That solved the problem enough so that it doesn't happen quite as often, but it still happens once in a while. However, I was to later learn (as recently as a few weeks ago) that I was one of the lucky few who actually got it working (even if it was not a complete cure) with a replacement card. The issue seems to run much deeper than the card itself. In fact, if you go to HP forums, you will hear constant noise about how the wireless problem breeds from a sinister defect in the motherboard, and how every laptop they've ever released in this series actually will eventually stop working (usually a couple of months after the warranty expires). I am now starting to see other signs that indicate that mine's only a few weeks (if not days) from that fate (see the \\\\\"spooky turning on\\\\\" a few paragraphs down). Another reason this laptop is so cheap - HP compromised on the motherboard, as well as the wireless card.    BIOS. I have had laptops going back to my old Quantex (dating back to 10 years ago), that used to have BIOSes smart enough to tell when the battery was about to run out of juice. They would then warn if you tried to start your laptop on low battery. On the flip side, they WOULDN'T warn if your battery was charged a 100%. This brilliant offering from HP, on the other hand, keeps warning you even if you just replaced your depleted battery with a fully charged battery. I am so used to this basic functionality in all my other laptops that when I replace my battery on the train, turn it back on and go back to my phone to check messages, I come back a minute or two later and expect that I am at the log on screen. But to my utter exasperation, I find each time that I am still stuck at the annoying BIOS message that warns me of a LOW BATTERY!!! So the laptop simply won't go ahead and boot unless I hit the Enter key. I can't imagine how much time I have wasted due to this. (Moreover, I probably lost a couple of years of my life due to the rise in blood pressure, and my already precarious spot in a good place in the afterlife due the choice curse words I have uttered each time.)    But if that's an annoyance, what it does when the battery is low is downright scary. When the battery is 25% or lower, and you start the laptop not knowing how much battery is remaining, it starts up without warning you at all. But that's not the problem - in fact, it's a good thing. The problem is, it just dies when the battery reaches critical mass, without EVER attempting to hibernate (as my laptop is configured to). It just goes poof - and SHUTS DOWN! Just like that! That means all my unsaved work up until that point is completely lost. It happened to me twice before I realized what insidious bug was causing the problem. I have now started keeping track of the battery levels when I hibernate the laptop, never turning it back on if the level was below the 25% level at the time of hibernation.    Another annoying thing about the BIOS is that over the past two weeks, it just randomly turns on! I don't recall doing anything to it. Randomly, in the middle of the night,the laptop just turns on! It could be some weird wake-on-LAN setting that got tweaked, or maybe my laptop is about to die (like the other ten thousand or so owners), or it's possessed by evil spirits. But it just turns on and wakes me up almost every night! Of course, when it happens in the middle of the night, I'm too sleepy to resolve the issue. When I'm wide awake, I forget to investigate. As a result, the problem has continued for the past two weeks.    Track Pad. The track pad in its initial setting was unusable. Even after month of tweaking, the base of my thumb would keep touching the pad and make the cursor jump to another part of the document. It was small enough a problem, but annoying enough that at one point, I wanted to return the laptop. I finally hit the sensitivity setting that resolved this issue.    Active/Passive Pen & the Display. One of the biggest disappointments was the fact that the TX-1000 does not use an active pen to do its tablet work. That was another way HP managed to cut costs and make the tablet seem like a no-brainer over the other vendors, at least in terms of the price. The fact is, the passive pen is absolutely useless, and the touch screen very insensitive. In fact, at times, I have had to press so hard that I'm almost afraid that I might end up breaking the screen! An active pen is a thing of beauty, and a joy to behold. It comes with features such as mouse moving with a hover, the ability to erase text with the opposite side of the pen (as with a regular pencil on paper), and the pleasure of writing effortlessly on the screen. You get none of that with HP's TX-1000.     In any case, the \\\\\"passive\\\\\" pen technology has been around for ages in all the Pocket PC's, which work impeccably with a stylus (I've owned the renowned (and my favorite HP hardware) HP Jornada 548, The Dell Axim, Samsung i730, and most recently the AT&T Tilt - which BTW also work pretty well with just your thumb). On top of that, every one of the pocket PC's have had a crisper, brighter display. And none of them ever showed the underlying touch grid on the screen. I could barely see it on the Samsung, and that too, only if I stared hard in broad daylight. But it was never a distraction. On this laptop, the display is terrible. It's faded, low contrast, and shows the underlying grid even in moderate lighting (such as on a train), which turns out to be a major distraction. In broad daylight, working with this laptop is not recommended. I have since gotten used to this and have swallowed it like a bitter pill.     So if those things aren't bad enough already, consider the regular litany of annoying HP software/crapware that arrogantly starts up with Windows (msconfig.exe has become my best friend ever since I started buying off-the-shelf PC's). HP is arguably the worst software producer of all. HP software is only mildly benign than a virus. What makes it more dangerous than all the other free garbage out there is the sanctimonious attitude with which they add it in there. \\\\\"Oh, you probably don't know what you're doing. Therefore, here's our offering to protect you from yourself.\\\\\" When in fact 90% of all problems are caused by the software starting up on Startup. It's ironic that when I was speaking with an HP tech for resolving my wireless issue, the first thing he made me do was turn off all the \\\\\"crap\\\\\" that loads up at Windows Startup. WITHOUT EXCEPTION, every one of the apps/utilities we turned off were from HP.     So why did I even bother to give it one star? Several reasons:  1. I couldn't rate it any lower ;-).  2. The full-size keyboard is decent.   3. Contrary to what I had expected, the swiveling hinge which connects the screen to the rest of the laptop is pretty solid and doesn't rattle on the train, as some of my skeptical friends had predicted.  4. I upgraded it to Vista Ultimate, and everything worked smoothly. In fact, after the upgrade (and applying SP1), the laptop has been slightly more stable.  5. I just like Vista better than XP in most respects (but that has absolutely nothing to do with the laptop).  6. Unlike the ten thousand or so poor devils out there who own the TX series, my wireless issues almost got resolved, and my laptop is still breathing.    So the one thing I did learn was, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Then there was this other little gem that reinforced itself - you get what you pay for.",

The other nice thing is that most mobile phones now charge with a micro USB cord.<br /><br />This device stores power and charges using a micro USB cable - the same cable that charges this pack also reverses to charge your phone.<br /><br />My first impression is \\\\\"wow, this thing is tiny\\\\\"  See picture) It's as tall as a chapstick tube and thinner.  You could easily carry it in your pocket without noticing. The problem is that it only stores 1000 MAH *Milli-amp hour) which means that it has less charge than your average smart phone - for example the HTC EVO and HTC Touch Pro 2 use a 1800 MAH battery.  Half a charge is better than nothing but it would be much more useful to be able to provide power while on a long flight.<br /><br />There's something of a quandary here.  If it's too big you won't carry it with you all the time and then you're out of luck when you need it.  On the other hand, if you plan to carry it in a briefcase or purse, then it doesn't need to be that small.  I'd propose that this is too large to put on a keychain and therefore it could be at least 2x as large without being inconvenient.  In this case I'd propose that it would be more useful to store more power.<br /><br />Although 4000 MAH is actually almost exactly 4X bigger (by volume) it's still quite small - smaller than most smart phones - consequently I'd suggest looking at [[ASIN:B005L38XLY Belkin F8M159tt Power Pack 2000]]  or  [[ASIN:B005LIDN50 Belkin F8M160 Power Pack 4000]] which provide 2X and 4X the power.  They are quite pricey however.  Although Belkin makes fantastic stuff, you may want to shop around - there are quite a few USB battery packs in the 4000-5000 MAH range from reputable manufactures for the same price as this device.<br /><br />Another option would be the [[ASIN:B001F5Q3RS Energizer Energi To Go Mini & Micro USB Tips Cel2musb]] and some rechargable batteries - a pair of AA's should give you about 2000 MAH.  Not as neat and easy or small but more effective.  I'd also consider the 2000 and 4000 MAH versions, but they get a bit pricey.<br /><br />How will I use it?  My smartphone charges when docked to my computer and I also have a charger in the car for when I use it as a GPS.  On the other hand I have a digital Camcorder which always seems to be at one bar of power just when I want to shoot a soccer game, etc.  I plan to put it in the camera bag for use as emergency backup.<br /><br />If you have any questions, comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!e.

Playing games like TF2, CS, Space Marine, etc was an absolute joy. The headset itself was really comfy over long periods of time (you know, like 4 hour raids or Saturday TF2 marathons). The mic quality was \\\\\"decent\\\\\" but the mic was fully adjustable and removable too, so that was cool.   The fail:  First headset: Extremely long cord led to bf tripping over it, ripping the Audio connector very cleanly off from the cable. I was able to repair this by stripping it down and re-soldering it. Unfortunately the microphone was not so forgiving, and never worked again. This happened about 1 month after buying it.   Second headset: Same issue. Had cord attached to the side of the desk, still managed to snag it. In this case I ripped the Microphone connector off at the base and was unable to repair it. Audio still worked fine, but we bought these for voice comm.   At this point we felt that the issues we had were not necessarily a failure of the headsets, though we were surprised by the poor quality. For comparison: we have a $10 plantronics headset working flawlessly some 8-odd years later. Plus, these headsets were still \\\\\"on sale\\\\\" at the time.   Third headset: Purchased at the end of July 2011, roughly 4 months ago. At this point I have completely babied the headset. The cord was managed well and never tripped on. I never pushed the limits on volume, etc. THE @#$%ing thing still died. Put it down after watching a youtube video, returned roughly 15 minutes later to discover that the headset is completely dead. No Audio, no Mic. Checked for possible shorts anywhere, confirmed the ports were working, etc. Nada, it's dead Jim. Going to try to RMA as I still have the original box and receipt, but really. Wtf Creative?  In conclusion, if you need a good headset for really cheap and don't plan on using it much, this is probably a great buy. Otherwise,you should suck up the extra 30 bucks or so and buy something much higher quality. Personally, I'm done dealing with Creative.",

The ArmorSuit has been the worst of any I have seen.  First off, the application of the protector involves a fair amount of work compared to other types.  You have to use a liquid spray on the back of the protector and on the screen itself.  While the fit of the protector is fine, the final clarity leaves a lot to be desired. I noticed what looked like imperfections or slight fingerprints underneath the protector when it finally dried.  About a week later, I put on a flexible case cover for the iPod Touch.  Within about 5 minutes, several areas had started to buckle up.  Despite trying to smooth them down and adding more liquid, and using a heat blower, this did not solve the problem.<br /><br />Not only that, but the manufacturer claims that the technology is self healing.  I can verify that there were indeed indentations that remained in the film surface after trying to rub and smooth the edges out.  If this is the type of material that our military uses, then I really feel sorry for the quality that they are getting with this.<br /><br />Since the manufacturer offers a lifetime warranty, I was initially going to get a replacement.  But then found out they wanted about $3 plus tax for handling and shipping, and you first have to mail the original protector back to them.  I figured the same thing would probably happen to the replacement protector and didn't want to spend another cent on this.  I did some research and ordered another type of protector - Tech Armor.  Received it earlier this week and installed it without needing any liquids, absolutely zero bubbles or lint, and the clarity is a lot better. Installed the case and no buckling of the protector whatsoever.  Not only that, but I left the ArmorSuit home button protector on, and you could clearly see that this material had a yellowishcast to it compared to the Tech Armor.  The Tech Armor protector provides a glass like finish and very happy with that.  I wasted $10 on the ArmorSuit so hopefully this review will save someone else from making the same mistake.",

It could be a great way to add huge amounts of \\\\\"cloud\\\\\" storage to your arsenal, a way to share pictures and other documents, as the inclusion of \\\\\"Active Copy\\\\\" makes it a viable backup alternative. 2) It falls flat on every single one of these promises. You get gigabyes (or terabytes) of space...when it detects your drive. It has been my experience that my drives are detected about 33% of the time, and when they are detected they will randomly become de-synced from the service and require a manual restart to get them back online. This totally defeats the purpose of having a \\\\\"cloud\\\\\" storage option, as it requires the user to interact physically with the device (and is generally a frustrating experience overall. Active Copy is a nice feature, but I refuse to back up anything important to the device because, at a moments notice, the drive may simply stop working. Drives stop working even during the active copy process, causing the backup to stop less than halfway through. That wouldn't be TOO terrible, but the copy speeds are slow slow slow.

Combine the slow transfer speeds and the the device's knack for going offline whenever you need it and you've got a sub-standard product. However, the product has the ability to redeem itself with what should be its crowning feature - movie storage and streaming. Unfortunately, the movie streaming and storage is just as bad as the other aspects of the product. Storage is, obviously, dependent on the other aspects of the review (such as write speed and device uptime) However, if you do manage to get a few movies on the device, feel free to stream them. Unless they're .mkv. Also, each movie has to be \\\\\"optimized\\\\\" for playback, a process which takes longer than downloading the movie (~2.5 hours of a 700 MB, 90 minute movie) If you do have the patience to optimize a video file, you can attempt to play it back, but you won't enjoy the experience. Subject to frequent stops and a buggy media player with few options, the experience leaves a lot to be desired.",

It would either take over 5 minutes to find and connect to my WiFi or would completely fail to find any wireless networks at all. I manually installed various versions of the driver from Toshiba but none cleared up the problem. Recently, I uninstalled ALL the network adapters listed in Device Manager, rebooted, and now it connects to my WiFi immediately after opening the lid (funny this did not work when I'd tried it in the past).<br />--------<br /><br />Before the age of touch tablets, there were `netbooks' - extremely portable laptops that were small, light and relatively cheap (compared to full laptops) with very modest specs designed only for the most basic of chores like browsing the web and reading email. Netbooks had fallen out of favor over the years to tablets but the Toshiba Satellite Radius L15W updates the netbook with a twist by combing the netbook with a tablet in a single device.<br /><br />Following the latest must-have trend, the Radius - powered by Windows 8.1 - offers a transforming rotatable touch screen that allows you to use it as a standard laptop or a tablet or both at the same time.  The laptop brings some nice features to the table for an inexpensive model including built-in Bluetooth, a USB 3 port and an HDMI port as well as the good old SD card slot and headphone jack plus a physical volume control (I really miss those). As was true for netbooks of the past, the Radius' specs are fairly modest with a dual-core Celeron processor (a step up from the Atom processors found in old netbooks but still rather modest), a 500GB harddrive and a meager 2GB of memory - the absolute MINIMUM recommended by Microsoft for Windows 8.1. Memory for this model is not upgradable and is shared with the Intel graphics chipset. Interestingly, Toshiba decided on the 64 bit version of Windows 8.1. The battery is internal and not replaceable without opening the case.<br /><br />The Radius is very thin and light but does not feel flimsy in any way. The hinges for the rotating screen appear to be metal hinting at a sturdy build. The chiclet keyboard is very reliable and only requires a light touch. The touchpad isn't quite as responsive as I'm used to but wasn't too difficult to adjust to and the touchscreen reacts quickly and smoothly (plus I have a wireless Bluetooth mouse). The screen is clear and bright in AC powered mode but can feel a somewhat cramped in term of real-estate when using the standard Windows interface. Radius has a built-in orientation sensor and will flip the screen accordingly in tablet mode. Unsurprisingly, the bottom firing built-in speakers are easy to block and tinny-sounding but offer better volume than some. The DTS Sound feature appears to be little more than a built-in audio processing and equalizer app but it does a pretty good job with a set of headphones plugged in though really only serves to give a (useful) volume boost when using the built-in speakers. [UPDATE] The laptop also has screen mirroring capabilities for use with smart TVs allowing you to send video and sound directly to the TV via WiFi. Connecting to my Sony smart TV generally took a few tries but once the laptop connected, it worked quite well.<br /><br />The Radius comes with Windows 8.1, the goto version of Windows for tablet duties. Toshiba thoughtfully includes Pokki Start Menu to replace the Windows Start Menu missing since Windows 8. The Radius also comes with a trial subscription to McAfee anti-virus. Setup was simple enough. Once Windows had finished its setup procedure, however, it became very clear that havingonly 2GB of memory was going to be an issue - Windows and McAfee alone ate up around half of all available memory. Once I installed Outlook to access my work email, opening a half dozen web pages would easily push the Radius past 85% memory usage where it slowed to a crawl. Even without Outlook running, opening a number of web pages at the same time would cause 100% disk usage leading to temporary slow downs and long pauses. The internal disk doesn't seem particularly speedy considering it can easily hit 100% disk usage for 10 seconds after opening a single web page. (NOTE: see UPDATE below)<br /><br />The Radius works quite well as a tablet, its small size and weight making it feel quite natural to use in this mode. The touch display is very responsive (if you're not doing anything very resource intensive). Once you flip the display back past a certain point, the keyboard is disabled - so you don't accidentally press keys while holding the tablet - and the orientation sensor becomes active so you can turn the Radius any way you like and the display will still appear right-side-up. The Radius is probably at its most likable in tablet mode.<br /><br />I've been a longtime happy owner of various Toshiba laptops - including one netbook - but feel Toshiba made a misstep offering the Radius L15W with only 2GB of memory and believe this laptop would have been much more usable if it had only included 4GB of memory instead.<br /><br />P.S. 1/29/15 - Let me add a few more comments after an additional month of daily usage:<br /><br />- The laptop can get VERY frustrating unless you take great care to limit the number of apps running and constantly monitor memory usage via Task Manager. I would highly recommend removing any unnecessary startup programs such as the Adobe Reader quick start and update programs. Once you exceed 85% memory usage, the laptop will start 'paging' (using the hard disk as memory) leading to a long slowdown. I have started exiting email once I have finished reading and only open one or two web pages at a time while watching memory to avoid this. Do consider the 4GB memory version of the Radius if you can afford it, you'll be much happier.<br /><br />- I have been plugging the Toshiba into my HD TV via HDMI to watch streaming SD content from Hulu. This actually works pretty well just as long as there is nothing else is running or open on the laptop.<br /><br />- Windows 8 does not include Microsoft Solitaire or the other standard Windows games but it can be downloaded for free and installed although the process of doing so is actually MUCH more complicated than it should be IF you don't want to create and link your Windows account to a Microsoft account.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br />UPDATE 911/2015<br />Considering how much time I wasted waiting for this laptop to stop acting sluggish or frozen due to 100% disk usage, I replaced the internal HDD with a solid state drive - the $75 [[ASIN:B0106AOB7G OCZ Storage Solutions Trion 100 Series 240GB SATA III 2.5&#34; Solid State Drive TRN100-25SAT3-240G]]. Yes, I lost half of the drive space but the difference is like night and day. The machine is now much more nimble and offers a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. With the SSD upgrade, this laptop rates rates at least 4 stars. I'd HIGHLY recommend the upgrade for anyone using this laptop. You'll be glad you did!up around half of all available memory.

This specific issue with text makes this unusable for me without an external monitor. Excel also looks funny because each box has a white inner and outer border as a result of the screen.  Smaller icons look poor as the pixel dot pitch obscures their detail, and oranges and greens look unnatural due to the poor gamut.<br /><br />It is the worst monitor I have seen on a laptop since 2002, and I have used many, many laptops.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you can tell the difference between DVD and VHS (and some people say they can't), this display will drive you absolutely bonkers.",

In other words, if I was to fold the keyboard section over so that is behind the tablet, there should be an additional support so that it remains upright in a triangular form.    For those who use the S pen frequently (such as myself), I find that the tablet is just one or two millimeters shy of fitting snugly in the case - when I detach the S pen, it is often caught behind part of the cover until one pushes the tablet further to the right so that the S pen is not obstructed.    The tablet wiggles about and often has to be pushed further in the case to reach the lower areas of the screen that are blocked by leather.    The leather strap the closes the case broke after a few weeks of use.     The usb part of the keyboard broke after twisting the cable while it was plugged in.",

I tried this unit, and returned it, because there was no support to resolve two issues.<br /><br />First, the Social Networks key software is very outdated.  I thought it would be helpful to use the key to activate a different program that is current and actually usefull, ie. YooNo or TweetDeck.  When I called support to ask about a utility, or registry entry that would allow this, I was told that type of support would cost me an extra $300.  I then found out that Gateway does not have a method, at any price, to re-program that key.<br /><br />The second problem was far more crucial.  When using Windows 7 background slide show ( provided in the default software ) instead of the fixed Gateway logo background, the touchpad would start malfunctioning when the background changed to a new slide ( all part of the default show provided by Microsoft ).  It was possible to fix the problem, but it would occur again with some of the new slides.  An external mouse worked fine.  Gateway had absolutley no willingness, at the highest levels, to address this problem, making the computer useless for my work.<br /><br />Gateway also expressed the position that adding any software to the computer essentially relieved them of any support obligations for faulty performance.  Perhaps if the powersupply failed, or the monitor wouldn't turn on, they might fix it.  I clarified by asking if this policy applied in only Microsoft Office 2010 were installed, and the head of customer service affirmed that position.<br /><br />As a long time Gateway fan, I was disappointed to encounter these new service policies.  However, I can no longer recommend any Acer/Gateway products as a result.",

If you are going to rotate it you better remember where you started from because after rotating it you can't just close it and expect the magnet close to work.  The rotated iPad's magnet is now at the top or off to the side, depending, and the case's magnet is at that bottom, or top, or side, depending, but you won't realize it until you notice it's still on and there is no click when it closes. Then it's a comedy of errors trying to find the right combination of rotation and closing to get it back correctly aligned to the magnet with the close button.<br /><br />The little plastic strips designed to hold the ipad upright at different angles are worthless.The iPad slides across those things as if they were skids greased for easy sliding.  No amount of coaxing will change things. The iPad just flies across them to flat in a blink.  I found if you stand it upright and push it hard against the back rotating thing and keep it away from the slippery plastic strips it will stand upright until someone walks by creating a slight breeze which causes the iPad to slide forward until it hits the plastic strips which then cause an increase in slide speed to the iPad until it is lying flat again in under a second.<br /><br />The magnet works but it doesn't hold.  When I'm carrying the case there is so much clicking going on as it connects and disconnects constantly putting the ipad to sleep then waking it up again over and over that it sounds like castanets.<br /><br />The elastic band designed to hold the flap shut looks like the clasp broke and I had to make a makeshift fix, like tape on broken glasses.  I looked before I ordered but didn't notice this case had one of those.<br /><br />The price is such that it isn't worth returning.  By the time I pay for shipping etc it'll take up almost all my refund.  If I had it to do again, I wouldn't.  Just sayin.",

We called in and they sent us a new one for free with in a week and I have to say their customer service is polite. It worked until April of 2013 in  which then I was having the same problem with the new Kindle I got in early December. What made this even more frustrating was that this Kindle I had for more than one week and had lots of pictures on it and it would not turn back on unless I plugged it into the computer and would still was occasionally shutting down. We called customer service and they helped get most of the pictures off. Then I was sent and new Kindle and I got most my games back on because they were stored on the cloud but I had lost all the progress on all my games which I had been playing for months which was also highly frustrating. It is now almost the end of July 2013 and my Kindle is now not fully shutting off but powering off in just two times today without my permission. The only thing I have to grant through all of this is that there customer service is friendly. If you are reading this review I warn you to save $150 more and buy and I pad mini. Though they will send you a new Kindle it is not worth the stress of loosing your pictures and progress in your games. I hope that the troubles with my  third Kindle will resolve themselves but if it gets worse and starts fully shutting down or continues Amazon will be hearing from me for the fourth time and I will hopefully receive another Kindle and I may consider buying and I pad mini.

After 7 weeks, it starting leaking at the left hand pump fitting, where it connects to the tubing.

I was getting download speeds of up to 50Mbps when I had previously been using the Western Digital wireless router, but then I moved it to another area of the house. As a result, the signal was weaker and I had to boost it.<br /><br />I bought the Amped repeater after reading the reviews and description, and the best I got after repeating the signal was about 5Mbps. I realize you will get half the original signal  on average when you boost a wireless signal like this, but this wasn't even functional. Then to top it off, one of the antenna broke off the base so I am stuck with one antenna. I'm no longer using it, its collecting dust in my stash of junk. I've turned to running conduit along the outside of the house with cat6 cable and connecting another wireless router running in access point mode to repeat the signal at no loss of strength.

Screen resolution is great, Netflix plays flawlessly and once i installed the media player, it played video from the AV server flawless without converting into a 'mobile' format or using transcoding from the DLNA media server.<br />My only concern is the skinny charging plug/jack; it Does Not charge through the mini usb port. If your giving it to children or your a lil rough on inserting power cords, it could pose a problem in the future. I like to have adapters that I can have ready to go in the car and the lack of the usb charge means another Charger.. small price to pay for a tablet that fits the budget, performs great and looks good too.<br />I started noticeing some hangups....

Over the past couple of months I have spoken to customer service multiple times, have been issued an RMA number that that will not work with their inane online processing system that spits out errors at every turn, been apologized to more times than I can count, yet still sit here with a completely dead dock and absolutely no indication of replacement or repair in sight. Perhaps my unit and CS experience were a fluke, but I am anxious to get past Belkin and their expensive paperweight and search for a working solution... cross my fingers and hope for a Sonnet I guess.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I use this little dock to run multiple external hard drives and a MOTU audio interface. So far, I have had no hiccups. It's handy because I mounted it backwards so all the ports are facing me.

I visualized having a central point to store and stream media, and save files other than on a local PC, thumbs or a library of disks. The descriptions of this product make it seem perfect.  I would also assume this is a common desire.  This device wasted my time for two years. The interfaces were lethargic and flaky, the performance bad, and Linksys support mustn't like this product much either. They were about as much help as a sponge in a hurricane.  After a long struggle against a molasses-slow web console, mediocre network performance and mysterious mid-stream connection drops I was finally able to update the firmware (a single upgrade made available after two years), which more than doubled the interface speed. Big issue there--how could a product with so many glaring faults get off the QA desk?  My Linux boxes hate connecting to it, my Windows 7 pukes on the uPnP and security whenever it is most inconvenient.  I'm still troubleshooting it. I won't tire you with too much tech or Linksys-bashing... considering Linksys makes many darn good products.  This is not one of those good products.  If you want to out-of-box have a streaming library and reliable network data storage, look somewhere else, such as a router with a USB slot. Perhaps other brands are better, but if Linksys blew it, I can't imagine many doing better.  I'd suspect a bad unit--overheating motherboard or such except that my issues are popping up all over the web, experienced by many. Instead I intend to disable uPnP and another feature that turns failed logins into guest access--under advisement from another troubled user.  Don't plan to make this work out of the box. perhaps don't plan it to work out at all.  For anyone interested, update the firmware, disable the guest account stuff and uPnp. Also, create a login with the same user name and password as a login to your local machine and use that to access your files or theadmin setup. Assign it a static IP and hopefully your router has a reserving engine for this. (Note, I didn't get good results using dhcp to assign an IP from the router, and make sure you set the DNS to the IP of your router (most home routers serve DNS.  Also you might try mapping a drive to the storage locations in windows. But this device costs too much, plus the hard drives... to be a backyard project. Good luck.",

The included Tuxera NTFS drivers could not be installed on my desktop computer. Mac OS 10.10.3 cannot read/mount the included .dmg file (error message when attempting to mount the disk image: The following disk images couldn't be opened: Image - Tuxera NTFS for Mac.dmg, Reason - image not recognized). The wireless network created by the device is unstable. It constantly drops out, can't be seen during wireless scans, rejects known passwords and appears to 'turn off' when idle. This 'Mac Compatible' product is not worth the 10+ hours I've spent troubleshooting it. I've spent numerous hours trying to get it to work (two different whdd units over five days worth of troubleshooting) with my iMac, my iPad and iPhone (and an Airport Timecapsule running version 7.6.4 for internet bridging). The software for the iOS devices is difficult to use/non-intuitive and the instructions are not helpful. I couldn't figure out how to copy the photos from an SDHC card (32gb, class 10) to the wireless hard drive. They transferred to the iOS (my iPad) device, but that's not useful if you're trying to make room for numerous photos. I had to install NTFS-3G and MacFUSE in order to enable read/write (from the desktop) to the NTFS formatted whdd. All in all - This wireless portable hard-drive needs considerable work before it's 'compatible' with Mac/iOS devices. Calling Toshiba for 'technical support' resulted in numerous (three) hang-ups, a promised call back that never happened, numerous communications/language issues, a statement that technical support is not available for this product and a total lack of support.

I got it on time and came with a paper stating several problems that may arise with it and how to solve them. Well, they occurred... getting the battery drained, disconnecting the power cord, detaching the battery and holding the power button for 30s did no difference. The netbook, an ASUS 1005HA, did not wanted to charge the battery even after staying overnight connected. The \\\\\"reset\\\\\" method simply does not apply to this model. The battery was never recognized, not even to be able to start the three recommended full cycles of charge and drain to set it up.<br /><br />The pros:  the support was great from the dealer, getting a fast refund (only for the battery - the transport to return it was not refunded). UPDATE: the seller also refunded the return of the item.<br /><br />The cons:  it has been a waste of several days. The netbook only started up on the first attempt after switching to the new battery. From the second restart, the process just stopped while reading the BIOS. To pass that, I had to switch back to the old battery, start-up once and then switch to the new battery.<br /><br />conclusion: do not waste your time nor money, this battery is no more than a brick at least for me.

The pricing is excellent compared to the storage capacity, and they work very well in regards to compatibility with PCs and USB ports.    Where the Kingston drives fail miserably is in their user ergonomics.  First up is the cap.  The cap is on tight - real tight - and that is good, since it helps prevent it from getting lost.  However, the shape of the cap - tapering in the same direction you'll need to pull it - combined with the tightness, and therefore the effort needed to remove it, makes it very difficult to grip long enough to get it off.  Kingston could have overcome this easily by including some grooves, ribs, or some flares or depressions to enhance your grip, but inexplicably they didn't.    The fatal flaw for me is the keychain loop on the rear of the drive.  For me, the USB drive is all about mobility.  I like to be able to carry 4GB of data around with me; it's fantastically handy to port that much storage.  But, and this is a big \\\\\"but\\\\\", you MUST be able to make sure the data stays with you.  Who wants to lose their data? No one does that I know of.  And this is where the drive lets you down.  The loop for hanging it on a keychain is far too weak to hold up to even light duty use.  Mine broke within 6 days of use, and it was shocking how little effort it took for the loop to break. A very gentle tug of my keys from a backpack pocket, an act that my [[ASIN:B0003009E4 Lexar Media 1 GB JumpDrive Sport USB Flash ( JDSP1GB-231 ) (Retail Package)]]has endured for nearly 2 years without complaint, and yet the Kingston snapped its loop completely off.  To further add insult, it now has 2 very sharp barbs where the loops were, requiring me to perform some surgery on the drive just to make sure it doesn't pose a danger to fingers.    I'm headed back to the Lexar JumpDrive Sport family, which I appreciate even more than I did now that I've seen the failings of the competition.",

Also, the range extender seemed to interfere or confuse the wi-fi signal that was going to my iPad.  Whenever the extender was on, the iPad could not lock onto the signal at all.

Although this Acer Aspire has a 1 GHz dual-core CPU and twice the amount of RAM as my old Gateway, it's appallingly slow!  For example, with the Norton 360 internet security, Firefox web browser, and Thunderbird email client running, the CPU occupancy spikes to 99%!  During this scenario, the RAM and hard drive aren't close to their limits.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's a bigger problem with this Acer laptop!  The battery abruptly dies without Windows first displaying the low battery power warning!  Acer let me exchange the battery for a new one, but the new battery has the same problem!  I found that I need to configure Windows power management to display the low battery warning at 50% battery power, because the battery dies at about 44%!  With this setting, I get a 2 hour run-time.<br /><br />Since this Acer laptop doesn't meet my performance expectations and the battery life is too short to make this device useful for me, I had to replace it with a Dell Inspiron 3148, even though the Acer is only 9 months old!

USB dongle is not responding and has solid blue light which mimics the issue when I had to uninstall/re-install as noted below. I'm giving up and Medialink is going into the garbage. While my fix below worked for one day, I have no intention of repeating these steps. Go with another brand of Bluetooth USB.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/31/13-I had non-working Medialink Version 3.0 Bluetooth device in my hand to throw out when I remember someone else's review saying something about re-installing driver with a disc included with device. I still had original packaging and it does have (2) disc. I did not remember that (13) months after purchase. It seems most USB devices these days have software loaded in device itself. My wireless headphones and boombox installed their own driver software on this PC once I added them to the PC using this Bluetooth dongle, no disc needed.<br /><br />I'm using this device with a Sony VAIO running Windows 7. So I uninstalled WIDCOMMM Bluetooth Software, Publisher Broadcom Corporation. Weird sold by Mediabridge, says Medialink on dongle and this is the software name. I re-installed this program and the Bluetooth device is now working again. I don't think you should have to uninstall/re-install any software in such a short period of time. Many people are not computer literate and would never have been able to do this.<br /><br />Something else I forgot to mention is my device came apart at plastic end sticking out of USB drive. I used some Gorilla duct tape cut to size of end to put it back together many months ago. And even if your doesn't come apart you may tape something on it as the blue blinking light is very annoying if you are working in lower light environment.<br /><br />I am doing another test of audio as I type. Running Slacker Radio on both PC and iPhone 5 and audio just sounds richer/fuller on the iPhone. The PC seems to befarther away. I am not using equalizer on either device so I would expect audio to be the same but in all fairness it could be the sound card installed in the PC causing sound to be slightly different compared to an iPhone. If you are not an audiophile, you may never notice difference but I am always comparing ear-buds to ear-buds to Bluetooth devices trying to get best sound out of whatever source I am using.<br /><br />The total amount of time deleting my Bluetooth devices from PC, adding again, restarting PC numerous times trying to fix along with uninstall/re-install and updating Amazon review had to be at least (3) hours. I am only giving this device (2) stars for the reasons stated above. Minus (1) for coming apart/too bright blinking blue light in darker room & less rich audio. Minus (2) for time wasted rebooting PC/deleting devices then re-adding & uninstall/re-installing software just (13) months after purchase. Too much time wasted just trying to use this product. The iPhone takes about (15) seconds to add device and have Bluetooth up and running.<br /><br />1/29/13-I purchased Version 3.0 device in 12/2011. This item worked initially for LG HBS-700 Bluetooth headphones and Logitech Wireless/Bluetooth Boombox but after not using it for several months, it no longer worked on my next attempt. And just (1) month past one year warranty. Both Bluetooth devices work flawlessly with the iPhone. Most importantly the audio quality is not the same as when using iPhone. I wasted hours trying to fix problem. I tried to download driver again and Medialink indicates you must purchase driver or it will not work after 40 days. What? Don't waste your money or time like I did. Complete absolute failure.",

This causes the graphics processor to lose electrical connectivity with the mother board.  The unit powers up (lights go on) but the screen stays totally black.  There is a big class action lawsuit in the formative stages regarding this very issue.  When you examine the motherboard from this model (and every other HP laptop since the Compaq/HP merger) one thing is striking...the motherboard thickness is about half that of any Sony VAIO model or Toshiba unit.  HP engineers also elected to use a single heat sink to cool both the GPU and the CPU.  The fix for this endemic HP laptop problem involves either reheating the GPU to readhere the solder to the motherboard or, better, removing the GPU, cleaning up the low grade solder, and resoldering the GPU with a higher grade solder that will not degrade at GPU operating temps.  If the high temps and inadequate heat sinking has caused mother board warpage, you're looking at a new motherboard.  When the computer is reassembled copper shims should be fabricated to place between the GPU, the CPU, and the heat sink.  Use thermal conductive paste also.  There are a number of YouTube videos that go through all this and the fixes in detail.<br /><br />In summary, HP laptops seem to be steadily declining in quality.  This is due to a combination of poor engineering and the use of inadequate quality materials.  A laptop should last at least 5 years.  These current production HP laptops often fail between one and two years.  That is, right after the factory warranty runs out.  Sony and Toshiba don't suffer from these issues near as often as HP, Dell, and even Apple does.  The few dollars HP saves in producing these laptops costs the consumer hundreds down the road.  Cost to fix the above problems ranges from $125 + shipping to $400 plus.  Thus these repairs may not make economical sense.  A new laptop purchase is mandated.  The only vote the consumer has is with his/her wallet.  Until HP fixes this endemic problem, consider purchasing your laptop from a different manufacturer.sense.  A new laptop purchase is mandated.

I've had the AGPtek 9-inch Android 4.0 tablet PC for about a week. First I found that the \\\\\"user guide\\\\\" in the box was worse than useless. It was poorly printed on pages of tissue-thin paper about 2x3 inches and contained many screenshots that were totally black. The downloaded version had legible pictures but was generally of not much help. It even contained inconsistent advice, such as admonishing the user to use the USB connection only for the transmission of data, but then on another page pointing out that it could be used for faster recharging (than the ac adapter). For the uninitiated Android user, a brief introduction to Android software might have been helpful, or at least a link to an Android tutorial. The worst problem I encountered was the tablet's poor wi-fi performance. The tablet consistently indicated that the signal from my home wi-fi network was \\\\\"weak,\\\\\" and sometimes too weak for the tablet to download anything. This is in spite of the perfectly normal performance of my aging LG telephone, my also aging netbook computer, and my even more remotely located Roku box under the TV. The only way I could get the tablet to operate through a wi-fi connection was to position myself about three feet from the wireless router, and even then the AGPtek would only show one or two arc-shaped bars, still indicating a very weak signal. In contrast, a signal strength app I have installed on my phone shows a \\\\\"moderate\\\\\" to \\\\\"good\\\\\" signal strength throughout the house. I can only conclude that the wireless transmitter/receiver function of the tablet is defective in either its design or its manufacture. The battery holds a charge only for a couple of hours or so, probably as a consequence of the perceived low signal strength of my home network. (The tablet probably ramps up it's receiver gain to the max in an effort to receive a better signal, andin so doing runs the battery down quickly.) My advice is to pay more up front and get a tablet with a brand name you can trust. Don't buy the AGPtek tablet. One way or another, this one is going back. I should probably give only one star and not two because most of the uses I had in mind for this device were online ones.

I also found that if you try to scan anything larger than letter-size pages, the scanner memory will run out before you've finished scanning the item, making stitching impossible because when it reconnects to the page, you find you have to start all over.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers about the cord. The cord is covered in rubber that grips the paper and moves it when you're trying to scan. Nothing can be done about it, other than taping the corners of the sheet to the table surface. It's a huge annoyance. The bad thing is, the cord is positioned level with the scanning surface, so it literally skips across the surface while you scan.<br /><br />A better design would have been to make the cord position higher on the mouse so it doesn't skip across the page along with the scanner and to cover it with a smooth-gliding plastic rather than gripping rubber. Not sure which one of LG's rocket-scientists made that call, but it doesn't work, which is surprising for an LG product. Most LG products are great. This one is not.<br /><br />Further on that subject, you will find NO support for this product on LG's U.S. site. You have to go to the UK site if you want any support or information on this product or to download the latest drivers and software for the product (if the autoupdate quits working within the software, which it does, sadly, leaving you to deal with failed installs.). For me, that kind of raises a skeptical eyebrow as to the reasoning behind the non-U.S. support.<br /><br />If you are scanning flat sheets, it does an ok job, but then flat sheets can be scanned with a regular flat-bed or page scanner better and more efficiently, so why spend money on something like this (unless space is an issue)? If space is an issue, you better keep tape nearby to dock the paper to the surface so the cord doesn't move it. And forget about any type of book scanning. Flatbed scanning is more efficient despite the dark spine sides.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm really bummed that this product didn't work for my needs. It's not perfect, by any means.",

Bear that in mind while reading this...<br /><br />The first issue is that the mouse's firmware somehow communicates to the Mac that it's not only a mouse, but also a new keyboard.  When sensing a new keyboard, OS X runs the user through a Keyboard Assistant application.  Every time I connected the Orochi to my Mac, this Assistant would come up.  And it happened with multiple Macs, too.  The only real work around was to disable the Assistant.<br /><br />The second issue I've been having is the application used to program the Orochi's buttons.  I can't get it to reliably set the programming and *keep* it.  Every time I'd connect the mouse, one or two of the programmed buttons would \\\\\"lose\\\\\" their settings.<br /><br />I think the failure here is that the Orochi's button programs are being somehow saved to the mouse itself (perhaps some NVRAM in the unit?)  The only way to set the mouse button programs is by having the Orochi connected via USB, which implies to me that they're writing something back to the mouse.  There are probably better ways to do that...<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't bother with this one if given the choice.  At least: not on a Mac.",

Recently, old new stock of the Intellimouse has jumped in price and will continue to rise, and in general I've always wanted a worthy wireless solution. I don't like the heavily used, highly reviewed premium offerings from Logitech, specifically the MX series. The form is just too large, heavy, and doesn't fit my hand. I also have had bad experiences with the cursor tracking performance in daily use.<br /><br />My criteria for the successor replacement:<br />* Similar form factor as Microsoft Intellimouse Optical<br />* 4-5 primary buttons, 8 buttons max<br />* Wireless<br />* Rechargeable<br />* Notched, &#34;stepping-click&#34; scroll wheel<br />* Gamer-caliber DPI resolution<br /><br />The short review assuming Razer updates their Mac Synapse 2.0 software:<br /><br />The Razer Mamba is an excellent mouse from a form and design perspective. It feels like a premium, &#34;Darth Vader&#34; Intellimouse in form-factor. The mouse feels great in the hand, the weight is perfect, and the cursor tracking phenomenal. The cable length is generous and the locking mechanism to switch between wired/wireless with the base station is well designed. My only minor criticism is that the closer-to-you thumb rocker button is a little easy to accidentally click.<br /><br />I've had to run it in wired mode with the &#34;classic&#34; Mamba 2012 driver (due to the crash reasons above). I otherwise love this mouse and hope Razer updates their software soon.br /><br />I've had to run it in wired mode with the &#34;classic&#34; Mamba 2012 driver (due to the crash reasons above).

My take from the reviews: The instructions suck and there seem to be many different ways to set this thing up and it appears its pretty random which way will work for a particular person.  My actual experience, that's all true.      Basically, you are getting a box with 2 lights on it and one button and only the most minimal instructions.  The included instructions don't even really say what the lights mean much less how the thing actually works nor do they account for various set up options and the \\\\\"one button setup\\\\\" may or may not work for you.  Have fun!      I was able to get it working following the instructions posted in the reviews below.  I did find the linksys help site useful too:   [...]     It works but does not work miracles.  Actually, one of my biggest problems was the improvement was subtle enough that it was hard to convince myself it was really working so I kept fiddling with it.  I was expecting a bit more.  But, it does work.  The bedroom connection that was Low before is now Good.  It will not blast through my aluminum siding to get coverage outside (I did not really expect it to but I was hoping it could defy physics).      For $25 the refurb unit is worth a try. (Based on all the trouble people appear to have with these things I assume most of the refurbs are just returns or sound units.  Mine looked new although it was repackaged in a brown box.)",

The Linksys AC2400/E8350 router, while it is capable of delivering truly excellent throughput, suffers from too many flaws to justify my owning one. I conducted my tests using a MacBook Pro (mid 2013 model), an iPhone 6, an iPad Air, 2 Apple TV units, and an ASUS ZenBook UX31E. I did upgrade the router's firmware to Ver.1.0.01 (build 14) beforehand. I have substantial experience with networking in office and home environments, including client configuration, so I can assure you the flaws are not the result of user error, an atypical environment, or a strange home layout. My tests were conducted in my apartment, a rectangular shaped 2 bedroom 1500 square foot apartment with dry walls, single story, with the router situated in the center of the apartment, with no conflicting channels from neighbors\u2019 routers. I was able to confirm the absence of channel conflicts using WiFi Explorer in OS X. I tested several different channels.<br /><br />WHY I RETURNED THIS ROUTER:<br /><br />This router was too slow in negotiating initial connection with any device. In addition, it was too slow or unreliable in reconnecting when taking my computer out of suspend or sleep mode, tasks that my prior router (a Cisco Linksys E4200) handled beautifully. These problems would even happen when my devices were within 8 feet or as far away as 30 feet of the router. The router's SSID on the laptop clients were properly configured to top priority. In addition, since I was the only person in the apartment when I conducted the tests, the load on the router from my various devices was light, to say the least.<br /><br />To make matters worse, laptops and devices would lose connectivity several times a day (even though the DHCP lease was configured to 1 week). My old E4200 router, which I have used flawlessly in this environment for more than 4 years, performed much better in every respect, except for throughput.<br /><br />I am returning the E8350 and have just purchased the E9200 and hoping it performs better.<br /><br />By the way, the E8350 self-identifies as a Belkin router when I scanned it using WiFi Explorer in OS X. I have never considered Belkin a maker of excellent equipment, and this experience has not helped to improve my opinion of them. As it stands now, this is an overpriced, low-end router within its class. Look elsewhere until new firmware is released that resolves these problems.d have just purchased the E9200 and hoping it performs better.

Desperate for help and still hooked on this device I turned to Amazon first to look at reviews and found an email for someone at Mad Catz and told him my issues. He was very helpfull and quick with his replies. Turns out that it was lint, dust and microscopic fibers that gets in the lens area that causes all the problem. The mouse lens are just too sensitive and there is no easy way to physically clean the lens either. They suggest Q-tips, but most of time those will also leave lint in the lens area too. Well that being said, my Rat 7 will go back in its box and I will just hang on to it in case I move into a sterile environment where there are no lint's or dust. Maybe future drivers will fix this problems.<br /><br />So, I will go back to optical mouse. Logitech G400 I think.",

It was easy to read, easy to use, and easy to love.  Because I didn't have any complaints about my Kindle, I never considered ordering any of the new models that have entered the market...until the Paperwhite.  The new backlit screen and allegedly improved ease of use convinced me to trade in my dinosaur for the sleek new model.<br /><br />I purchased the Paperwhite back in June, and a scant 4 months later I can report the dinosaur is back in my hands.<br /><br />Yes, the backlit screen is lovely and easier to read.  That's the beginning and end of the nice things I can say about this new Kindle.  My daughter came over today to check out my Kindle Paperwhite because she's considering getting one herself.  The Paperwhite, with incredible irony, chose that moment to not just be difficult, but refuse to work altogether.  The screen is frozen and my books won't show up no matter how many times I restart it.<br /><br />It's safe to say she's sticking to her dinosaur as well.  Perhaps I have a renegade Paperwhite and I think Amazon should know the little beast cost has cost them a sale.<br /><br />* * * Edited 11/1 to add: * * *<br /><br />After positing this review, Amazon took the initiative to contact me and help me work through the issues my Kindle was having.  They were courteous, sincere, and patient, and very willing to ensure my experience was positive.  The associate I spoke to assured me if the recent fixes to my Kindle didn't correct the problem permanently, they would send me a new one.  Amazon's committement to their customers and their products negates any negative remarks I may have initially had and will gladly continue to buy their products.",

The zippers are cheap - two of the main zippers split open repeatedly so when I'm walking I have to stop and try and reclose them to get them to stay shut, but they keep splitting. Not good anytime but when on the crowded NYC subway your bag ends up being wide open - especially the laptop part. This happened in less than a year and just gets worse. Secondly, the top handle for carrying is designed well - steel cable inside a soft plastic grip, but the plastic grip broke into three sharp pieces that makes it a hazard to try to grab - I'm talking broken skin. It looked so rugged I was shocked when that happened. And within two months. I like the color and design, etc. but split zippers and broken handles that are supposed to bear the brunt of the weight make this a disappointment.

I bought this router to finally go from Wireless-G to Wireless-N and to also benefit from Gigabit Ethernet within my LAN, hoping both wired and wireless backups would be noticeabky faster. This was a replacement for my old, and now again current WRT54g Linksys router.<br /><br />The initial set up was easy for both frequency bands and initially all seemed good. Then I tried to stream some music from my iTunes via AirPlay. All that happened was a router reboot. And several times. Had any backups or other critical traffic been going through at that point all would be lost. Cisco material did not provide much, offline or online. However, Googling revealed I was not the only one with this problem and various workarounds were suggested. Most meant sacrifices, including the loss of Wireless-N. That was not why I bought the router! One suggestion was disabling CTF, which should mean no trade offs in my situation. And I was happy for a moment again since AirPlay worked again and so did everything else.<br /><br />However, next day page loads were slow, some pages would not load at all, others lacked styel sheets, one big mess. I rebooted the router but that did not help. At this point, I was losing my patience since my rule is that new things should simply work and not need excessive troubleshooting. I swapped the router back for the WRT54g. Since I modeled the settings based on it the swap was easy. And boom, everything was back to perfect and reliable.<br /><br />Bottom line? I returned the \\\\\"top of the line\\\\\" product of 2012 and went back to the 54g that's been up and running non-stop for years. Glad I tried the switch when I did not have to since I had an easy way out. When I collect courage to try again, it will be a different brand. Sorry Cisco, but a router has to route!

Just an incredibly poorly-built product, incomprehensible instructions, and more glitches than you'd think possible.  The LCD screen quit working after about a month or two.  Plus the SD card recording fails almost literally 50% of the time.  Sometimes I'll go to eject the SD card to have my computer extract its contents as mp3/sound files, and it'll say the SD card is empty, that there's NO data saved!  So 2 months of phone calls - BAM! gone - instantly! just like that.  I can tell the device is recording (supposedly) and working clearly.  But sometimes it stops for no reason, and I have to unplug & plug it back in, to get it to reset.<br /><br />Here's the biggest red-flag that this is a poor-quality foreign-made product: there's no brand name!  None.  No manufacturer listed, either on the product itself, or the badly-mistranslated &#34;instructions&#34;.  No model # either - no way of identifying who made this or anything about it.  Just a few weeks ago, my unit started making up its own dates to name the audio files, so now I get folders on the SD card that are labelled with the year 2049 and 2050 *sigh* and no way to fix it.<br /><br />However, the worst flaw of this Mini-Telephone Recorder (something that I noticed instantly, which makes it a built-in design flaw) was that the volume of the other party on the line is much MUCH softer than your own voice.  So when you go to open up the sound file and listen to a previously-recorded conversation, your own voice will be like CRAZY screaming loud, but the volume of the person you're talking to will be so soft you can barely hear them!  And of course there's no way to manually adjust the recording volume control.  I wish I could find a cheap simple device like this except built WELL here in America!",

I had to &#34;redo&#34; it several times to get the bubbles out, and, I'm generally quite good at installing these flawlessly.  Of course, every time you have to re-situate the protector, you run additional risk of introducing foreign object (namely, dust and lint) into the picture.  I would give these only a &#34;2&#34; in terms of ease of installation compared to other screen protectors I've used on phones, tablets, and laptops.<br /><br />Appearance:  No complaints here.  They are crystal clear once you get all the bubbles out.<br /><br />Functionality:  Ok, here is where this product simply fails, and I have 2 screen protectors that I will probably never use now.  After installing the screen protector, the touch screen of my 2nd generation Nexus is awful.  Prior to putting a screen protector on, the Nexus touchscreen is about the best out there.  After putting on the protector, I feel like I have a cheap tablet with an inferior screen.  Just as an example, when playing Candy Crush and Solitaire, I have to sometimes swipe the screen 5 or more times to make a move.  This is unacceptable, and it is clearly the result of the screen protector because I've used my tablet for 2+ years without a screen protector and it performed flawlessly.  I just can't understand why a company would make a product that so drastically impairs the functionality of the touch screen it's meant to protect.<br /><br />I would not purchase these.

The version that is shipping now is a pale imitation of the original.  If you are considering one of these backpacks, do not rely on the early reviews because the product is NOT the same.    Detail:  Over the last 5-6 years I have owned 3 of these backpacks.  The one currently shipping (see \\\\\"Version 3\\\\\" below) is NOT as pictured.  Here's a quick recap:    Version 1:  My original backpack - purchased in 2002 or so - this version of the 15.4 Targus Gravity was well made and included both shoulder straps and a strap you could buckle around your waist.  Given the volume the bag holds, these were very nice features because a heavily loaded pack (in my case full of lots of books and a much heavier 2002-era laptop) was surprisingly comfortable to carry around.    Version 2:  When my original bag wore out (I'm pretty rough on them - no fault of Targus there) I wanted to buy the identical model.  I thought I had - they had the same model number after all.  Not so.  (This purchase was made in 2006 or 2007.)  The bag I received was otherwise identical to Version 1, but Targus stopped including the waist strap.  I was pretty annoyed at this, but eventually got over it as I was unable to find anything better.    Version 3:  In November 2009, my second backpack wore out.  As with before, I wanted to purchase the IDENTICAL laptop bag.  Hence, I searched for and bought the IDENTICAL model number - the Targus RG0318 15.4 Gravity.  Guess what, they changed the design AGAIN!  They removed one of the two zippered side pockets, leaving just the useless mesh holder that things will fall out of if you ever set the bag on its side, toss it into the back of a car, into the overhead bin of a plane, etc. etc. etc.  USELESS.  Also, the interior materials are much cheaper and have a mass produced quality to them.  They replaced the cool foldable document holder (that would keep papers nice and flat and out of the way) in the main compartment with a cheap velcro pouch.    The stock pictures you see listed are for what I call Version 2 above.  I.e. they are OUT OF DATE and do not show the current instance of this backpack.  If you buy the model now you will NOT get two zippered side pockets as shown, but only one.    Dear Targus: If you are going to change your product offerings, that's fine, do whatever you like, but DO NOT NAME THEM ALL WITH THE SAME MODEL NUMBER!  It's a huge difference to get rid of a belly strap and then get rid of one of the zippered side pockets on a product like a backpack.  These aren't mild cosmetic updates.  They are fundamental changes to the product's usefulness, and changes for the worse at that.",

Maintain the anti-glare feature of your original Kindle 2 screen<br />2. Dust Repelling, Fingerprint Free, and Bubble-free Application<br />3. Sized to specifically fit the Amazon Kindle 2<br /><br />My claims are as follows:<br /><br />1. The anti-glare feature is fairly good, except if you get a bunch of dust under the screen protector. Dust causes bubbles, bubbles cause glare.<br /><br />2. Dust repelling? I dunno. My Kindle is inside a cover when it's not being used. It does seem to resist fingerprints but there's no such thing as a bubble-free application of this product.  A perfect installation with no bubbles would be possible only in a dust free environment. Most people don't have access to such an environment.<br /><br />3. Yes the size is perfect... but unless your vision is also perfect, getting this item positioned on top of your Kindle screen in EXACTLY the position needed is time consuming... and with the sticky side of this product exposed to the air (and also the dust) for the length of time needed to get the product in the correct position... all I can say about that is bad... bad... bad.<br /><br />In conclusion, I have to give this product an over-all rating of one star for the difficulty of getting a perfect installation.",

I plugged it into every port, and the light wouldn't come on, and my cursor wouldn't move when I used the pen nor mouse.  By then, the warranty was up, and I was unable to get a new one.  My mother, a technical engineer, took a look at it and found several broken wires.  She fixed them, and still nothing.  She is currently fixing more wires, so I have yet to see if it can be saved.

I took it apart again and installed my bad one. Plugged that in and tried game cd. This spun the disc. Checked the new one and what should i find inside? A freakin elastic hair band!

It is just so component unfriendly. So anything Dell says about this machine's upgrade potential, you need to seriously think about DIY. I bought it ~$300. Now the labor cost for installing memory is 13% on top of the purchase price.<br /><br />4. Is it really 3GB installed on the original machine? The BestBuy guy rolled his eyes and said he never heard off 3GB. The two sticks being replaced show 1 GB each.

Restarting the device sometimes corrects this. Even worse, it randomly disconnects while I'm transferring files!<br />- Slow transfer speeds: My network isn't the fastest thing out there, but this device has EXTREMELY slow, inconsistent, transfer speeds. The primary reason I bought this device was to store the massive amounts of photos we take. The transfer speeds on this make me dread having to transfer my photos.<br />- File corruption: I've noticed that if I'm transferring a large amount of files, if the device loses connectivity, then regains it, some of the files being transferred at that time become corrupted. For example - I transferred several dozen photos tonight. Naturally, this thing loses connectivity prior to all the files being transferred. Once connectivity was regained, I glanced through the files which did transfer, and several of them appear to be cropped in half. Fortunately, I still had access to the originals. The same thing happened several months back; that time, I hadn't realized the file corruptions until I deleted the photos from my SD card!<br /><br />Stay away from this device.

            "input": "I was looking forward to getting this laptop for a very long time because I really liked the Air form factor but really dislike the closed nature of the Apple ecosystem. The Asus is definitely a beautiful laptop and I liked its design a lot, but I think they got the basics wrong, which is shocking: wireless, touchpad, keyboard, and customer service.   First and foremost the wireless did not function correctly. At first I noticed that it went in and out even though I was sitting right in front of the router and none of the other people in the room with laptops experienced the same problem. Alone, I could live with this, but if you plan to stream a lot of content, be forewarned. Second, when I opened up my laptop after closing it for a bit, it couldn't find ANY wireless networks. I had to troubleshoot, at which point it told me that the network adapter had been turned off and asked me if I wanted to turn it back on again. This happened EVERY time I opened the lid - so, so much for your instant connect. I really just can't imagine any good reason for why any computer manufacturer would ever default the computer to disable the wireless without the user asking for that. I updated the WLAN driver, updated the BIOS, and also changed the power settings so that wireless would never be turned off to conserve power. I did everything, and nothing fixed these issues for me. I should add that I have a very nice, relatively new $160 router - it's not the router!  Second, even though I updated the driver for the touchpad, I kept experiencing problems with it. Scroll worked ok, but not as smoothly as on an Air. However, the special gestures just didn't work properly. I'd try to zoom in or out and it would zoom too much or too little and when I tried to rein it back, it just kept overshooting and it just wasn't usable. Likewise, every zoom in or out took a while to actually update, so you'd just be sitting in front of a frozen page while it tried to change the size of the page - it wasn't an instant experience like on the iPhone or the Air. I ended up disabling those features. Likewise, the touchpad insisted on zooming even when all I was trying to do was scroll. So....it's livable, but it's no improvement on the standard touch pad if the gestures are basically unusable.   Third, the keyboard just wasn't great. I'd type and it would miss every 5th key or so. I'd have to go back and retype everything. I feel like this is something I could probably get used to after a while and train myself to type harder, but it just seemed strange to be having such a basic issue on a very expensive, top of the line laptop, when even the cheapest netbooks had better keyboards.  Fourth, I called Asus customer support. I had registered my laptop and had become a member with the support stuff, but they insisted on taking my name and email and machine number, making me respell everything three or four times. I'm really not kidding - it took them 10 minutes just to get that info down and I don't know what the point of registering with the site was if I was going to be asked all this stuff again. I told them I had wireless issues and they didn't suggest changing power saver settings or getting the new WLAN driver (I read about that online), instead they suggested updating the BIOS. They sent me a link to their updates page and that was it. So, first of all, I feel like they didn't offer all available fixes. Second, when I went to the page there were three BIOS options and I had no idea which one I needed. I got all three, but then I couldn't open and install them! My friend figured out you had to go to a utility on the computer to get them updated. NOWHERE did it say how to implement these updates. We did use the utility, but then there was no feedback to say that anything had been updated, so who knows if it even worked. I called support back and they insisted that I give them all of that personal info again, even though I had a service number from the last time I called. So I had to repeat my name 5 times yet again! Don't they have all that info on file from the last call?? Why give a service number if you're going to spend 10 minutes asking me basic info AGAIN? So I gave him all that info and he started doing something and I was on hold for a while and we got disconnected. I called a third time, and they asked me for all of my info AGAIN. I told the person that I had already given info twice in the last hour and I didn't want to do it again, since clearly it was in front of him now that I had provided a service number and the info twice before. He insisted three times that he couldn't help me without me \\\\\"verifying\\\\\" that the info was correct. So, I gave up and hung up.   So, be forewarned, trying to get service is both unhelpful and frustrating.   In the end, I decided to send this back and I'm typing this review from an Air. Trust me, I waited for over a year to replace my laptop just so that I wouldn't have to buy an Apple, but dealing with the Asus truly drove me into Apple's arms. With the Air, none of those issues are a problem. If you ever need tech support, you show up at an Apple store and someone helps you instantly - no calls to Bangalore with people who are just reading from a script. Everything just works. There's no bloatware. In the Asus, you had both Asus and Windows utilities that seemed to conflict- like more than one manager for power and wireless. You might have fixed a problem in one and not the other. Plus, you get a nice backlit keyboard and pretty amazing gestures. Sure, it's more expensive, but if you're going to shell out over $1000 for a laptop anyway, don't you expect the most fundamental things to work?  As an aside for Asus's benefit, since you guys read this site, I think you sunk not just the Zenbook, but the entire ultrabook campaign. People really thought they'd finally get an Air alternative and then were sorely disappointed. Guess what? They did what I did - returned your computer and got anAir. Guess who won't be buying another laptop for another 2 years or so? All of the people who were disappointed with yours! But, that's not just bad news for the Zenbook, it's bad news for you because those of us whose first intro to Asus was the Zenbook now believe that you make half baked products. Likewise, you've proven yet again that no one can do it as well as Apple. This is all very unfortunate because many of us were rooting for an Apple competitor and many of us truly do believe that the more open approach to software development and platforms is the right way to go. But, by creating yet another crappy product, I think you're driving many people to believe otherwise. Problem is that once Apple gets you into their ecosystem with one product, they really make it appealing to then add other products or services to that ecosystem and the more people do that, the harder it will be for you to ever get them out of it. I think you missed a real opportunity to turn things around for yourselves.",

Put simply if you travel forget the hype you won't be able to obtain some of the books you want through Amazon's Kindle Store.    The Kindle DX fall short on most of the claims. The dream of almost instant book purchases smashed just like the Kindle DX should be.     What's good?    Nothing!     It would be fine for an over 75 year old totally technology illiterate and wanting only to look at their old books that are now free because they are out of copyright. If you are under 65 perhaps you would like something of the current generation and not something designed in a bygone era long since forgotten then this Kindle isn't for you. If the dweebs that designed this don't change it, it could go theway of Betamax - well we can at least hope!    Take your money and spend it more wisely by investing in an iPad and simply add the Kindle app to it. Any other choice is a waste of money.    Some you love and some you hate - don't be a laughing stock buy something else.    REMEDIAL ACTION REQUIRED WITHOUT DELAY IF IT ISN'T TO BECOME ANOTHER BETAMAX TYPE FAILURE    Give the Kindle a full color touch screen and get rid of the pathetic keyboard and buttons. Up grade the processors and slim the software. Try adding an internal back lighting so it can be read comfortably in poor lighting or in a car at night. Make it clear that not every book will be available at most locations and include a communications package so that people who enjoy reading and want to discuss the books they have consumed can talk to each other over email or wirelessly over the Web.

Bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it, but this is a terrible tablet. We have 4 children and have been through more than a few cheap tablets but this is by far the worst. Not enough battery to make it through one movie with the brightness set as low as possible. Takes longer to charge this thing than the amount of time you use it between charges... avoid this product at all costs, even if it was the last tablet in existence.",

Oh, they work great for a few months and then slowly, one by one, the drives start failing, then the controller starts failing, then the firmware needs updating, and so Microboards sends out a firmware update, then a replacement drive, but then when the problems persist they want you to send the whole thing back. And then they fix it up and replace drives and send it back to you two weeks later and it works great for a few weeks and then one by one the drives start failing again...and the cycle goes on and on. So we decided to buy another duplicator from them so we would not be without a machine while the other one (which we thought was a lemon) was being serviced. Well, much to our frustration, the second duplicator started doing the same thing as the first (working great...then drives start failing...mail it in). We have sent our duplicators in four times in two years!    So frustrating. Never again. We will never by another Microboards product ever.     So I started talking to people this week, trying to figure out what other brand to go with, and everybody I talk to who uses other brands says, \\\\\"Oh we never have any problem with ours.\\\\\" Now, I'm not going to tell you what brands they are using. I do not want you to think I'm a salesman for another company. But I will give you this advice: Save yourself a major headache: avoid Microboards and go with another brand duplicator!",

I have been using a Plantronics Gamecom Pro 1 from 2004. It finally died on me after 8 years of use in 2012, and I repaired it after a couple years and used it again. Then it died again, so I decided to go with Plantronics again because of how great that old headset was.  These are some things I noticed right off the bat:  -FRUSTRATION FREE PACKAGING? Want to know what this is? They take the bare headphones, throw them in a big spacious box with no padding, and then they ship it to you. No packaging around the headphones whatsoever.  -These things are extremely cheap feeling. It feels like nothing but hollowed out plastic.  -I have a small head, these things horribly clamp your skull and make your ears feel like they're broken after 10 minutes of wearing them. The ear cups are comfortable, except for the fact that your ears go straight to the actual earcup itself, which is only protected by a thin layer of fabric. It feels no different than shoving plastic on your ear with heavy force.  -They are designed to break after a year or so. Read all the other reviews around here and you will see a lot of mention of it. I am actually QUITE SURPRISED they DIDN'T SNAP the first time I put them on. There's cheap flimsy plastic above the cylinders on the ear cup, and you have to pull these vice grips apart really hard in order to wear them. The plastic turns white like it's being stressed after the first time you wear it. You may think you can tape it ahead of time, but looking at this, it looks like it will snap really hard one day.  -The cord is garbage as well. Really cheap flimsy cord. The quality of it is even worse than the 2004 Gamecom 1 cord. It constantly twists and it's literally impossible to uncoil some of the points. I tried with TOOLS and they refuse to uncoil. I have read that the cord eventually starts tosplit apart and break on its own after several weeks or months.  -The audio quality is &#34;ok&#34;. It's surprisingly nowhere near as good as the 2004 Plantronics Gamecom Pro 1 I had. This was designed 10 years ahead of time and it sounds worse? Alright then.  - The mic is decent. Again, I did a lot of tests myself and while talking online to other people, and the headset on this sounds EXACTLY like the Gamecom 1. ONCE AGAIN, 10 years into the future, and this hasn't improved at all. Like many other reviews on here, people state the mic usually goes first, and a lot of people state it fails after about a week or so. It will start making static noises, and eventually buzzing, and eventually fail altogether. I've had this for about a week, and guess what? The static noises have started.  -The surround sound sounds like crap. All it sounds like is an echo effect. That's literally it. It sounds like I'm in a cheesy fake auditorium talking to people with voices bouncing off all the walls.  All in all, this product takes the early-mid 2000s Plantronics Gamecom Pro 1, makes it 100 times worse, and then resells it years later.  This headset is garbage, stay away from it, buy something else. I am returning this immediately.",

The answer is that these speakers get their power via a USB but do not receive their audio via a USB. The speakers must be plugged in via your audio out or headphone jack in order to receive audio. More importantly the sound quality produced by the speakers is very poor, I would say that it's about the same as the internal speaker and my Mac Pro, only a little louder. These are cheap speakers, so I did not expect them to perform as well as my sound sticks, but I did expect better sound than the internal speaker in my computer.  The speakers are fairly small and portable so if you just need something for a laptop while you're on the road these might not be bad, but if you're expecting great sound quality you will be disappointed.",

I have lost part of a work document I was writing because the computer froze and wouldn't do anything, even task manager wouldn't fix the problem, and I had to force shut down.  Other times the computer has frozen and task manager won't even load, ctrl-alt-del just brings up a blank screen and a spinning mouse.  I expected this kind of thing from my 6 year old computer that I had filled to the brim of it's hard drive, but I have only had this Asus for about 3 months and have barely saved anything to it's hard drive yet. It definitely feels like it can't handle too many activities at once, and sometimes it can't even handle one at a time.  Also, this is something small, but I really miss my old computer's external volume dial.  Especially with the lag, I find it hard to quickly adjust the volume on this Asus.<br /><br />The only thing I really like about it is the touch screen, I like being able to zoom in closer on things that normally I could not, and I like swiping through pictures.",

The monitor remains turned on but the harddrive light stops flickering (sign of inactivity), the mouse won't move and the keyboard won't work...or wake it up from inactivity.  Consequently, I was required to always cold boot the machines.  Most of the time the machines would freeze during windows updates or during some other software updates.  Often, also, the machines would freeze after being left on and then allowing them to go on standby or sleep mode; it was impossible to get them out of standby or sleep mode, so it always resulted in unwanted cold boots (with the power button or by removing the battery).  Apparently the problem is persistent through a range of Acer Notebooks and Netbooks; either way, it is a shame because the machines could have potential (when they work properly).  In the acer support site it asks that you update the bios to either 3206 or later (3208).  Doing so worked--for a while that is.  I managed to get the machines to not freeze during software updates, but I still can't get them to stop freezing after going into standby or sleep mode; I always end up having to cold boot the machine.  Everything else works great (once all software and system updates are installed, of course).

I've also had issues with my IP address being reassigned to other devices and windows telling me I have ip address conflicts (To hopefully fix this issue there is a setting in the router to assign a specific mac address to an ip address). We probably have about 10 or so devices connected to the router. And lastly, I bought a Western Digital USB Hard Drive and connected it to the router. The problem is, the drive appears to go into sleep mode and the router does not know how to keep it active or reawaken it so that feature is completely useless.

I finally received it as a gift much later, and I have to say, after having used it for a few months, that I am very disappointed with the quality of the case given the price.<br /><br />The biggest problem I've had is that the tiny plastic hooks that keep the iPad securely in place have snapped off on two corners.  At the time, I did not remove and replace the case with any type of frequency that would cause them to snap off, just one day I noticed one of the corners was missing and it was starting to get a little loose, then one of the other corners snapped off and I was unable to keep the case in place period.  I do not use the iPad outside of the house, nor do I let my children play with it.<br /><br />The other problem is that the way the mold is cut, the corners of the case scrape against the iPad and leave scuff marks on the corners.  This seems like a real production flaw and almost defeats the whole purpose of the protective nature of the cover.<br /><br />Overall, it looks great on the back of the iPad and matches the Smart Cover well, but unfortunately, it just doesn't serve the purpose it was intended to very well.",

Some decided negatives: flash player on websites dos NOT work properly, seizes up after a few seconds, sound goes on behind a static picture. Unacceptable. The Samsung book cover case, though OK by feel (far from the ingenuity of the iPad cover, though) has one appallingly bad design feature: when closed, the side edge presses on the on/off switch. It beggars belief that this could be allowed to happen. Plus, the tilt of the tablet, when used with the cover is with the 'top' pointing down and certain applications do not rotate 180 degrees to accommodate this. If you place the tablet the \\\\\"wrong\\\\\" way in the case, you solve that problem (and, ironically the one with the accidental on/off button press!) but the charging/USB cable is now on the inside, so you have to keep the case wide open to charge. Utterly idiotic.     I deliberately refuse to by i-somethings as I refuse to believe that one company should have a global monopoly on style and good design, so it is extremely annoying to see stupid oversights like these handing Apple on a plate the image of epitomy of cool design.

It has the bothetsome issue of some mobile devices these days where you have to plug in the charger just so, or it won't connect and won't power the device. Very frustrating. I realize this problem wouldn't affect all tablets of this model, and I could get it replaced under warranty to fix this, but there's other things that make me not want to.<br /><br />2) The tablet is pretty slow. Even turning all window animations off, this device chugs through even the most basic tasks, like browsing web pages or typing text. Not as responsive as I need.<br /><br />3) The display quality is barely passable. When watching Youtube or Netflix, the video is plagued with these awful jagged edges that, if I saw the same in a video game, would make me want to turn anti-aliasing on.<br /><br />You know what I think when using this device? This is baby's first tablet. It would be fine to give to a child, who doesn't mind the slowness or visual problems. The low price would make that an attractive idea. For an adult though, this thing is just below acceptable. I guess it's too soon to expect a really good tablet for this cheap.",

(And if you're wondering why a touch-typist would want a large-type keyboard, you probably aren't aware of how often a programmer uses the the non-alphabetic.) Bottom line: Nobody should have to use a keyboard where you suddenly find yourself inadvertently typing in CAPS because you didn't hit the Shift key just so, or worse yet, unintentionally selecting a big block of material because the Shift key stuck and you hit an arrow key for a legitimate reason.<br /><br />One star is generous. It's trash. It's also just barely too cheap to justify the hassle and cost of return shipping. And yknow, recently I see lots of items like that for sale online -- vendors must realize they'd be swamped with returns if the items cost a bit more, so they price junky stuff just low enough to sucker you in and make you not bother demanding a refund.

However, I couldn't figure out which driver to use to install the Panda USB because the Mini CD that ships with the package is not readable by the internal CD/DVD drive found in my MacBookPro -- the drive doesn't have a retractable tray to which the mini disk can be coupled. Thus began my aggravations with the purchase of this adapter. The website for this product at [...] has the drivers for Mac, Linux, and Windows but no instructions to follow for installation. That's helpful. I was glad to download the driver over a 15k link if I could only tell what driver number applies to my wireless device. There is not a mention of the manufacturers model number anywhere on the adapter, on the packaging, or in the brief brochure that is included in the retail box. Once I am able to figure out that this card is RT3070 and download the software, the device remains unusable. The Ralink wireless manager software reports that the card is connected to my network, yet my ISR/access point does not show an association, and consequently an IP address isn't assigned to the device. However, there is no convincing the proprietary wi-fi manager that the adapter isn't actually associated. Lovely. Thinking that I may be able to use it on the Linux OS that dual boots on my laptop, I load up Fedora 11 and download the Linux driver from the RaLink website. Too bad that I cannot figure out how to get the installation going now that I have the driver. I don't know if it is not compatible with my distro or what. And where are the customers supposed to get the supposed one year technical support? The link from the manufacturers website immediately prompts the end user for username and password credentials without providing a link for one to use to create an account. I give up -- its a loss and a total waste of money. Had I known about the shoddy support and lack of documentation I would not have taken a chance on this product, let alone its inability to function in the Mac OS X environment. Caveat Emptor.",

I read that there is a bad batch of (fill in the blank - capacitors, transistors or whatever) and the screen started having vertical white noise lines. It got worse so I replaced it.

Slowly, I started having to pick it up, push the tablet back up to the top of the cover and retuck the tabs in the bottom around the bottome edge of the tablet because it began to slip down, making menus and feature on the bottom of the screen hard to access. Eventually it just stayed at the bottom with the tabs slipping down so I sent an email about the problem to the vendor.

We will ship you ANOTHER ONE if you like....&#34;<br />Well, I decided it wasn't worth the trouble to bother and I knew that this would duplicate and I would most likely have the same trouble sometime down the road.

On the mac, the family shared drive is inaccessible about 95% of the time.  This is well documented in the Netgear Forums.  3. Getting the Stora to work on the Xbox doesn't work.  You can't even play videos stored on your Stora on your TV via the Xbox 99% of the time.  ===============================  I bought the Stora 1TB device in the hopes of consolidating our family's digital photos and music files in one convenient location.  I'm in a unique situation because we own an Xbox360, a MacBook, and three windows laptops running Vista and Windows XP.  Getting all of these to work with the Stora was EXCEPTIONALLY challenging. (UPDATE... Since posting this, I've never been able to get it to work with Windows Vista) It seemed that at every corner was a new unexpected challenge to over come.  Although I'll admit that getting it connected to the network was relatively straightforward.  Here were the challenges I faced:  Mac:    - Due to an incompatibility with the way MacOS accesses network drives, the browser fails to connect to your family shared drive.  - Drag-n-Drop on the browser doesn't work either because of this.    - Ultimately, this device doesn't work on a Mac.  (just google 'netgear stora mac issues' and you'll see a plethora of complaints with virtually NO solutions offered by Netgear)  Windows Vista:  - Every time I try to connect to the Stora with the desktop agent on my Vista laptop I get the following error message \\\\\"\\\\\"Local Connection to Stora Impossible. Do you want to try a remote connection instead?\\\\\".  When you say, \\\\\"yes\\\\\" to the question, the system fails.  This is a problem because I cannot upload data to the Stora from my Vista laptop because of this.  I've tried every recommendation possible and there is no known solution to this problem.  - Basically, like the Mac, this doesn't work with Vista. Again, google 'Netgear Stora Vista Issue' and you'll also see a ton of unresolved problems.  XBox360:  -  Videos don't play with Xbox.  I have several videos from our wedding uploaded to the stora.  They are *.avi format.  When I try to play them on my Xbox 360, I got an error message that Xbox needs a special codec for this file format.  This may be an Xbox issue, but this is an advertised benefit of the Stora.  I've not found a work around for this.  -  Xbox does not see new files or directories on the Stora.  This is mostly an XBOX issue, really, but when you add new photos to the Stora and try to view them on the Xbox, the Xbox doesn't list them for a few hours or sometimes days.  It's as if the Xbox keeps a copy of the Stora directory structure locally and doesn't update is until it wants to.  You can reboot your stora and your xbox for hours and your files will not be visible on the xbox for a couple days, then POOF!!  The suddenly are there.  -  Xbox only works with Stora if you set up an entirely separate computer as a media server, connect it to the stora, and connect the Xbox to the computer, then it all works.  Why even buy a Stora then?  What's the point of advertising that the Stora works with the Xbox when it requires A WHOLE SEPARATE COMPUTER to work??!!!!!  I blame both Microsoft and Netgear for this.  - All your iTunes albums will play songs ONLY in alphabetical order on the Xbox.  You cannot rearrange the order of these songs.  I tried to create a playlist for one album (Charlie Brown Christmas) that ran in the correct order only to get an error message that the Xbox doesn't allow you to create playlists on external hard drives.  WindowsXP:  - I tried to use the backup options for the Stora displayed in the stora web page.  However, Stora's method of computer backups does not work with the built-in backup tools on XP.  You have to buy a separate software package to make this work.  I work in the technology industry and consider myself fairly savvy when itcomes to resolving these types of issues.  Despite my experience, I spent hours trying to fix these problems with few successes.  If you are not technically capable, I'd think twice before using this product.  ================  Summary - This thing is just a complete and total pain in the @ss to get to work correctly.",

For spending over $1800 what I got was a laptop that was flaky and unreliable right out of the box. The first week it would open with a warning \u201cYour PC needs to be repaired \u2026 critical files are missing \u2026\u201d; and then move on to open up Window 8.1  Over a three week period I sent three emails to Tech Support, and opened a chat session asking for help.  Even though I had paid for \u2018premium\u2019 tech support, NO one ever responded to help me with my issue. Finally, after the fourth week it woke up again with the ominous warning \u201cYour PC needs to be repaired \u2026 files missing \u2026 contact your Manufacturer!\u201d  and froze with the locked screen of death.  Eventually, I got someone to talk to me. Typically when you call the DELL 800 number for support you will get a message \u2018We\u2019re not available now leave a message, or call back in an hour or two\u201d.  Finally they sent out a media to completely reinstall my operating system. It asked for me to insert another thumb drive to back up my files. Of course later I discovered it had actually saved none of my files, photos, S/W apps etc. It was then several days later that I discovered their so called \u2018recovery\u2019 disk had not bothered to install over a dozen Intel drivers that were missing. It also failed to reinstall the Windows Office software I had paid for. Interestingly, during those three weeks I did get a call from a very friendly lady offering me a 2 year warranty for the \u2018bargain\u2019 price of only ~$230 per year, for a \u2018discount\u2019 package of ~$460. DELL has very slow tech support, they have deficient quality control, \u2026 But they are really good at \u201cmarketing\u201d.  By the way, Windows 8.1 is clunky to learn and use.

I bought this because there was a positive review about this memory in a W520 Thinkpad. But I had a very different result. My system has both SSD and HDD, one for my personal use and another for corporate use. My company forces a lot of junk in the name of security, group policies etc... slowing my system significantly. One day my system came up with \\\\\"health check\\\\\" dialog and corrupted both my hard disks. I thought it was my corporate security junk that ruined all my personal and corporate data. Lucikly I had backup of both, with a few exceptions. So I re-installed the OS on both HDD and got going again. But everytime I boot my system chkdsk would try to run. So after installing the OS for the third time, I was getting less optimistic of my Thinkpad. My display would also go blank (as you see during power save mode), and would not come back on. I thought it was bad power manager or bad video driver. I had to cold boot everytime I hit this issue. I changed my power settings to \\\\\"never turne off display\\\\\" and the problem still wont go away. I also noticed the wireless and bluetooth LED indicators would turn off along with the monitor. This gave me an indication it is not likely a power manager or video driver problem, I tried to think of all possible reasons. I blamed by SSD and Seagate HDD for this problem as usual. Got an RMA number for the Seagate HDD too. Ahhh... I replaced my memory too last week. So I removed the 16gb RAM and put back the old 8GB I had in my possession. After that I have been running fine with my old memory, display turns off and comes back on without any problem. So I think it is very likely a Komputerbay memory that has caused all this mess.<br /><br />As for memory speed etc... I saw no difference whatsoever. I wish it worked in my W520, unfortunately it did not.<br /><br />Amazon was kind enough to pay for return shipping and take it back. When Itried to get RMA number from Newegg for the Seagate HDD, they not only forced me to pay for the return shipping, they tried to print the UPS lable for me so they could make some money on it, they claimed it costs me less, but it costs just the same had I done it myself - I am sure they have a spectacular deal with UPS, I know this because I too work for a large corporation. Also I dont see Newegg offering great deals anymore, for some reason they are becoming more like CircuitCity. (BTW I never had to return my Seagate after I found the problem was with my memory).",

It looked good and the macbook air closed without a problem. The item looked like it could withstand several scratches and a dink or two.<br /><br />TAKING IT OFF<br />It is nearly impossible to take this thing off! While the tabs (there are six of them - two where the screen meets the keyboard and four along the edge closest to you) that holds the cover to the macbook in place very securly, it also causes a major problem for those who wants to take it off for whatever reason. It took me nearly 30 minutes to loosen ONE tab. At that point I got irritated and decided to cut the tabs off with my flush cutter...which surprisingly cut through the cover with ease.<br /><br />I would not recommend this item unless you plan on never taking it off.",

Installation was very easy to do - just plug it into the USB and insert the CD.  The gamepad also felt very natural in my hand.  It's also very easy to create different configurations for my games.  It seemed prety great until I sat down and started gaming with it - it was then I found the reason why I never use this.<br />The gamepad only recognizes up to 3 simotaneous button pushes at a time.  If you press 4 or more, the pad goes crazy unlike what would normally happen with a keyboard.  Pressing 4 or more buttons might not seem like something you do much but you'll be surprized how much you do (especially in FPS games).  <br />For instance, I was playing Medal of Honor with my Nostromo.  I move diagonally right while crotched (a total of 3 button presses to do).  While I'm doing this, I might press the \\\\\"use\\\\\" button.  But because the nostromo goes haywire after 3 button preses, I would whip out a grenade and throw it at my feet.  <br />Although the nostromo had great potential, it's one serious flaw prevented me from using it more than three times.

Despite having received about three different chargers and the space of several months and having to send the laptop (if you can call a piece of metal and plastic that hardly works a laptop) in to have the hard drive fixed, it still refuses to charge. The customer service is better than other companies I've seen, but noting has changed. It stops charging after a couple of months. Also, the mousepad is one of the flimsiest things I've ever seen and it's pretty much broken, making navigating the internet a hassle. The battery life is pathetic. Don't believe Amazon, take it from a user. It's four hours and thirty minutes and it takes three times longer to charge. You can't take it to school to take notes on, it will die before then. You have to keep it next to an outlet to be able actually use it. Also, it takes about thirty minutes to connect to wifi and it will drop the connection a random times. I had to use a chromebook for a test once and it spent about ten minutes trying to 'reconnect' to the school's wifi. All in all, just stay away from these... things. It has huge defects that Google has been ignoring and you'd be better off just sticking to your phones and tablets. These laptops have nothing to offer that an iPhone or iPad can't. Honestly, it may be cheaper, but you'll spend more time calling Customer Service than actually using it.<br /><br />-Proud Apple Customer",

I get screaming headaches in bright light and if I don't wear good polarized glasses, I can't be outside for any length of time.  I had planned to use the tablet mostly for reading, on my deck, in airplanes, at the picnic table at work for lunch, etc., but will be limited to only indoor reading, which is my least favorite place to read.  When I wear my polarized lenses, the screen is all blanked out, like when trying to sign the credit card screens with sunglasses.... not happening.<br /><br />It's larger than my Paperwhite, and not as heavy or clunky as my 17&#34; Dell laptop, but it's pretty useless as a reader.  Also, the super shiny screen shows fingerprints galore, which is annoying as all get out.  Truthfully, I may try to send it back and stick with a huge laptop and a reader that I can actually use for reading!",

So this does include the M4800.<br />I bought the m4700 5 months ago and it was broken on delivery. They sent a tech guy out who replaced the screen, hard drive, video card and something else. 3 service calls the first week I had the new computer.<br />The computer shut down all the time and gave me copious blue screens. After hours on the computer with the remote repair they gave up finally. After 3.5 months of nothing but problems. Then 3 weeks ago they sent me a brand new m4800. After two weeks it totally broke. It is unfixable. The tech guy replaced the motherboard, video card, power source twice in a week and it is unfix-able. I asked for a refund. They refuse. I have documented all the phone calls and hours and I have spent over 30 hours and been hung up on over 25 times in 5 months. Or \\\\\"disconnected\\\\\" They bounce you from India, to the wrong dept, to this and that and no one takes responsibility for your case. It is so bad.<br />I have now been without a computer for another 10 days and it will be another 3-4 weeks before they can get me a replacement. Since I bought this computer I have not had one good day of use and yet they refuse to refund me. I hate Dell with every fiber of my being now.  I run an online business so this has severely impacted me. I have had to move hard drives over 3 times. I spent the entire weekend moving my files that are a year old to an old laptop I had to borrow, since the entire reason I bought this Dell in the first place is my Acer was overheating all the time.<br />I am on hold now with a tech talking to his manager to reorder the next replacement and guess what? He swore he would not hang up on me, and the phone just disconnected.  Do not buy a Dell. Do not buy a Dell. It is not worth it. Miracle, he called me back. He said they cannot replace it since the service tech said it was unfixable, but that does not mean it cannot be fixed! The tech rep I  told me I had to take apart my computer on the phone with him first before I could get a replacement.<br />He refused to order me a replacement. I decided to try a different tech rep and the next one I got decided to actually help me and order me my 3rd computer. I am not waiting for my 3rd computer from my original order 5 months ago.<br />Nightmare, total total nightmare. I am in the small-medium business sector so that is better service than the consumer, so it it is this bad for me, if you buy not as a business I cannot imagine how bad it would be.",

This ipad car seat holder is really a nice product in concept but is poorly built.  Here's the bottomline:<br />  a.  In terms of ease of use and flexibility;  it's awesome.  It fits on the car seat and is rock steady.  Huge caveat:  you obviously need a car seat headrest that will actually come off.  Most compact cars have this feature, but many larger cars / SUVs don't and thus won't work with this unit.  The ipad fits perfectly and with ease into the casing and it is solid.  Furthermore, you can move the viewing angle up / down / right / left;  most excellent if you have two kids in the back.<br />  b.  Ok, so the above is great and it is.  The problem is that the folks that brought you this item didn't put as much thought into the quality of product as they did the engineering of it.  ie, with the weight of the ipad and the stress via being the car (ie road bumps etc...), the cheap cheap plastic joint spontaneously broke after around... 6 months of sporadic use.  Now if they could make this same product with a metal type arm, that would be awesome, until then, definitely pass on this item because it will not last.",

Now, based on the price I know I shouldn't expect much, but I thought my expectations were reasonable.  Just gave my 7-year old this for his birthday yesterday.  Right out of the box, my initial thoughts are this thing is slow and clunky and it doesn't even have any programs, apps, etc. really running on it.......  I figured 'Zoodles' would already be installed, but it appears I need to install it.  I have spent almost 1 hour trying to install it and it still appears to not be fully installed??  It says it cannot install Adobe AIR?  I don't know, I am not much of a Techie, but for a kids tablet, it should be pretty straight forward.  My son was super excited when he got this, as this is an upgrade from his LeapPad2 tablet, which doesn't do much.  I was able to get him on the internet to play some basic games.  He was very excited, love the green cover and was overall happy.  Today is day 2 with the tablet and after he got home from school he played with it a bit more.  It was freezing and acting slow (you tap something on the screen and it takes a few seconds to respond).  Also, it appears the screen needs to be calibrated, because it doesn't pick up the correct location where you touch.  After a little while, my son asked if there was a way to return this and get one that worked.....ugg!  Well, I am thinking I need to return this to Amazon.  The question is - should I try another Dragon Touch - maybe I got a bad one?  I am still seeing so many positive reviews, even recent ones.......Or should I just go with a Kindle Fire and call it a day?  Can't beat the price at $60, but for $40 more I can get a Kindle Fire.  Appreciate hearing any comments or feedback.  Update, 5/20/2015:  Okay, so I just dropped this off at UPS to return to Amazon.  my son hasn't used it because it is painfully frustrating to use.  looking at the reviews this morning, I must have gotten a bad one?   I can't believe all the rave reviews on this tablet.  I am not a techie, I don't have all the latest gadgets.....so it is not like my expectations were too high.  This thing reminded me of a four year old laptop you get handed down at work......well, the search continues for a replacement for my son.",

If you are purchasing this for use in a loud office environment, the excessive noise might not be an issue, but if you  plan on sitting next to this unit in a quiet bedroom or home office, you might want to think about buying something else.

It does not reliably capture your engagement with scrolling, the motion is very inaccurate, and it does not reliably capture disengagement, so you continue to scroll when you don't want to. It is so painful to use, I could not do it for any length of time inspite of the coolness factor.  Perhaps one would learn to scroll reliably, but that's a lot of work for very little benefit!

For starters the display is hard to read except when it is set up to almost maximum brightness, however then it is like a nightlite in a dark bedroom, so a dimmer setting is a must, and then it is hard to read. The alarms are complex to set up. It took me half an hour to get there. Finally the sound is kind of at the base end of the spectrum. I was OK with this as my high frequency hearing is not great, however I found it sounding distorted at low volume making talk difficult to understand, especially  deeper male voices. I hoped to upgrade it for one with larger speakers, but the seller told me I had to return it unopened and within 10 days. Unfortunately they told me this one after I tried it. So both from the point of view of quality and service (BidDeal is the seller) I cannot recommend either. Sorry.",

Very little storage is available to begin with, and rather than swap out/off apps when space is needed for a new one (the others can always be re-downloaded on next launch, right?)  the tablet runs out of space about 3 times a week on average.<br /><br />When storage is limited, does the kindle THEN auto-remove or archive items?  Of course not, it instead DISABLES WIFI.  This is a great solution, as now, even things like netflix, which simply stream (and or course use some buffering space) won't work either.  So the tablet then can't download new apps/games, and also can't use any wifi requiring applications.<br /><br />Since it's a kid's tablet, you then have to put in the parental password, go to settings, clean up applications, and then re-enable wifi.  Then, you get to do it again in 1-3 days.<br /><br />This is probably the single biggest tech mistake purchase I've ever made, but we wanted them in time for x-mas and the had just been released.  My kids mostly end up on our normal tablets anyways, as these (I was dumb enough to buy two) are constantly in a state of lock-down from storage usage.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake - get a 'normal' android or apple tablet, and then get a child-proof case.",

It had a magnetic tab closure to hold the cover closed. when you flipped the cover completely open, that same tab could flip around and hold the cover open. You could then slide your hand into the inside pocket to hold the Kindle with one hand. Either Hand. And you could easily use the hand holding the device to change pages with ease.<br /><br />This Paperwhite cover is beautiful. It feels like heavyweight cardboard with a plastic back case. The Kindle fits very well. And there is a fun feature that wakes your Kindle when you open the case. Fun, but far less necessary than the missing features. The case snaps closed, but won't remain open. There is no pocket or loop on the inside of the case to slip your hand into. Ultimately, there is no comfortable way to hold the Kindle in this case in one hand and turn the pages.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed, especially since I pre-ordered this case and paid full retail price for it. Without these features the only advantage that this case provides is to protect the Kindle when it's in my handbag, and I can get a $15 case later to accomplish that.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Amazon and have been a Prime member for years. I have purchased 4 Kindles to date. But this Amazon product disappoints me. The designers added a cool new feature but neglected the basics. I will be returning it.",

Still, I figured it was cheaper than a new one so no big deal...hardware goes bad sometimes. Today, just now, the new one went bad (it has been another year give or take a month). That is enough for me. It's not so much the cost, which is cheap as far as KVMs go, as the hassle. <br /> <br />In addition, with this KVM, to switch between machine you press the scroll lock key twice and then either an up or down arrow. Not a big deal unless you switch a lot. Doing computer support in a consulting role for a living I've come across many KVM switches. Most of them are just too expensive for the normal home user but one I've used quite a bit is the IOGEAR GCS62 MiniView Micro KVM Switch. It has never failed and you scroll lock twice and it switches machines. It is about the same price...My recommendation is to buy that instead. I just did. =) <br /> <br />P.S. A couple people mentioned that they'd have to unplug and replug everything because it loses it's signal. That has also happened to me many times and a few times unplugging didn't do it.

It has been sent back twice--working on the third as I type this. The screen had dead pixels.  Half the usb port drivers died.  For several weeks now, when powering on, sometimes it powers on, other times it just sits there with the screen backlit but no one home.  Essentially, I have to system wipe it every 3 months or it doesn't work.   Occasionally, the NVIDIA card won't be detected by the system and hence no drivers will work or install.  Don't think Razer has solved the heat dissipation issue and the video cards are flaky. And I think there's a short somewhere in my system.  I'm a pretty experienced computer person and this one has driven me crazy.     Pretty much everything positive you've heard about this laptop is true.  I bought it for the screen pretty much alone.  It doesn't get 5 stars because the amount of HF noise on the adapter line is ridiculous.  I'm going to try a few different plug configurations, but when it is charging (and it's plugged into a pretty high quality power filter so I don't think it's that), there is a fairly unacceptable amount of noise that enters the system from the AC charger.  I have a pretty complex setup and In my case, it travels through a KVM (only plugged into usb for key/mouse at the moment on the laptop) I have set up and through the sound output which is why it's so bad--I can't listen to music through either system when it's plugged in.  Toroid coils also haven't helped but I was just using ones I had around the house.  Everything is plugged into that power filter, but it still could be the KVM (it's a good one, but when a system like that has so many plugs in proximity, the cross-talk is going to be bad regardless).  So I don't know.  Razer, you have any thoughts on the AC noise? Not sure it can be fixed...  &#60;&#60;Update&#62;&#62; Bypassed the sound from the KVM direct to a different stereo input and it's reduced the noise significantly at the expense of flipping more buttons to change sources.  Tweaking the gain on each device suppresses the noise, but it's still there.  Gets an additional star since I got it working, but could be a problem for serious audiophiles...",

First, it gets hot, those vents on the back aren't just for show, they move some air. Expect something akin to the exhaust coming out of the tail pipe of your car. This is easily remedied by picking up a cooling mat, preferably something with a little elevation, especially if your going to have it sitting in your lap.  Second, 3 weeks after receiving the laptop, The user files on the HDD were corrupted, rendering the computer useless. The only solution was to do a clean install of Windows 7.  Third, the DC charging pin attached to the motherboard broke off into the charger. This rendered the laptop unable to be charged up at all.  Other thoughts:  Battery life isn't the greatest, but anyone surprised by that should probably read the specs on the computer again.

My son, in particular, who is a computer engineer, suggested that it would be more frustration-free than Netflix or other readily available entertainment sources.  None of the above proved to be true.  The first device involved an array of problems that led to the conclusion that it was defective.  When my son visited for several days, he reached this conclusion despite all his expertise and attempts at help from Mayday.  He arranged to have a replacement sent.  Regardless of numerous attempts at help from Mayday for the second one, we lost all the programs that had been downloaded on the first one,  as well as the trial membership to Audible Books. Now we are even having trouble with confusion over our prime account and a notice that it has been canceled.  The recovery and rehab period are closer to the end than the beginning, but my husband has been unable to get any use out of this device.  The Mayday feature has been worse than useless - just one more source of frustration. It has been a total dud and a complete disappointment.  We would recommend it to no one.",

This was a dismal failure and support was atrocious. Undeterred, I then tried the Netgear Next. Equally poor result. Finally after weeks of waiting, I got my hands on the Belkin N1. Easy setup,and blazing speed-when it works. It loses connection with my Motorola surfboard modem at least once a day(seven days in a row). The N1 laptop card crashed my computer twice. In the mean time I'm using a very dependable Belkin super G router-no problems whatsoever. I ordered a new Belkin pre N today. If it ain't broke ,don't fix it! I love the Belkin product. Documentation and support are superb. Setup is a snap. I just think that wireless n is just not there yet. I suspect that backward compatibilty with wireless g is not as seamless as the vendors would like you to believe. I'll keep my N1 and look for firmware upgrades.

However, while this product does most of what it claims to, it falls very short in one critical area.<br /><br />But first, the good points.<br /><br />For any dock or base that is going to accept a phone or tablet (especially a full-sized iPad), stability is key. Fortunately, this item has that handled, but just barely. It's width of just over 3.25&#34; is very proportional for iPhones but it's a little on the narrow side for an iPad. That difference makes the dock dependent upon its weight to keep the iPad from tipping. If not disturbed, it can do so, but if the iPad were to be bumped (such as brushing up against it or fumbling for something on a nightstand) I think it might be at risk for sending the whole works for a ride. The rear support for each of the two devices that can be plugged into it is suitable to hold both iPhones and iPads from tipping over backwards.<br /><br />There is an adjustable dial for each docking bay that the instructions say will help adjust the Lightning plug at the base for a variety of devices, whether they are in cases or not. While a good idea in concept, the execution leaves something to be desired, and it's this execution that causes this product to get no more than a rare 2-star rating from me.<br /><br />The Lightning plug is embedded in a piece of black plastic that is roughly the size of the old 30-pin connector that was used on Apple products before the Lightning connector was introduced and became standard across Apple's new portable designs.<br /><br />I would imagine that doing this made some sort of sense from a tooling or manufacturing perspective, but that plastic base prevents the Lightning plug from being able to make a solid connection with devices that are in most cases that I have, including one made by Belkin for the iPhone 5. I also tried an Otterbox Commuter case for the iPhone 5, as well as an Otterbox Symmetrycase for the iPhone 6. All of those cases do not have a port hole wide enough to accept the wide plastic base on this dock, and no amount of adjustment with that dial is going to change the fact that the plastic base won't fit into a case port hole that is made for the much smaller Lightning connector.<br /><br />I contacted Belkin customer support for assistance, but that was Wednesday morning, and it's now Sunday night, and I never received a response, or even a confirmation message that they received my inquiry and were looking into the issue and would get back to me.<br /><br />Given the fact that this dock advertises itself to work with devices in cases and that it has what I consider a design flaw that would prevent it from doing so, and that I contacted Belkin and haven't heard a response even after 3 business days, I can't give this item more than a 2-star rating.<br /><br />If that plastic base were to be replaced with something much smaller, I would be happy to give it a 4-star rating. If you have cases that will fit that large base or that are so shallow that it won't matter (like most iPad cases), then it's a decent product. For me, it's pretty useless unless I take a Dremel and see if I can remove that extra plastic myself. No one should have to do that, especially for a device with this price tag.",

Decided one of them could be repurposed as a backup machine if only I could squeeze some more disks in there to get the storage.  Searching around for ways to add more disks to the G5 tower, I came across the Sonnet G5 Jive, purportedly able to add three additional drives to your G5.  I did my research, found all good reviews, checked out Sonnets page for the G5 Jive ([...] and confirmed it should be a go.  I even bought Western Digital drives as recommended on their page - and thinking about how smart I was being, I bought their Green drives which are supposed to pull more power than regular drives.  I should note I bought TB disks - they are cheap enough and common enough now that it made sense.    I installed it all - easy enough - and went to power it on.  The G5 hummed for about 2 seconds before powering down.  Huh.  Checked all my connections and then tried again.  Same hum, same powering down.  Disconnected the Jive, then tried again - all okay, powered up.  So, it was the Jive.  Maybe I'd made bad connections, so I disconnected then reconnected everything.  Same problem, two seconds of power, then gone.    Called Sonnet.  They always seemed to be a good company in my mind.  After some hold time I got on the phone with a fairly gruff sounding guy - no niceties here!  After explaining what had happened, and giving him all my info, he put me on hold again to chat with a colleague.  And then came back on and confirmed that I was using TB drives.  Yes.  Well there, apparently, is the problem.  When developing the Jive, Sonnet claimed that there were only 500GB & 750GB drives to test with and that they had never tested with 1TB drives.  Never?!  Nope...decided not to test them when 1TB drives became commonplace either.  Turns out, 1TB drives pull too much power.  And they acted like it was my fault for even trying to use TB drives!     So now I am stuck with 5 1TB drives, a Sonnet G5 Jive and a Sonnet Tempo SATA X4i PCI card - well over $1k worth of kit - and can't use it.  I told the support guy they need to keep testing their products and updating their product pages as they find information out like this.  We'll see how quickly they fix this.  It's messed up I tell ya.  So...if you are hoping to use this to expand your G5 with some modern hard drives - don't.  It just doesn't work :-/  Sonnet has now become 'The Worst Company Ever' in my book.",

To begin with, when you open the box you do not find any instructions other than a small card that directs you to the support link, which is rather a nightmare for a first time user.  I am no stranger to computers but getting this Kindle set-up to run is a real chore. One of the very first training videos would work for about one sentence then buffer, none of the subsequent others did this, but it was a headache. Before you begin find out your router password, I didn't know mine (still don't) but if you want to join a WiFi network you will need to know this.  If text-to-speech is important to you, try it before you register or do anything else. I waited until I had registered and bought some books, big mistake.  The text-to-speech voices are tinny and the volume, even turned to max is so low that it is useless.  I put on earphones and at full volume it was barely a notch above a whisper.I bought this Kindle because the text-to-speech feature was important to me.  I take road trips and I thought it would be great.  Let me tell you, there is no way you would be able to hear the narrator in a moving car, with or without earphones.  I am not sure if this is a defective Kindle but after reading some comments in the discussion group it seems this is a problem with this particular model of Kindle.  As a last observation, I am not a fan of this \\\\\"touch\\\\\" screen.  It moves too slow when using the menu functions.  Also some movements cause the Kindle to advance pages without even touching the screen.  This machine is being returned and exchanged for a different model. I am not ready to totally give up on Kindle, there are too many good comments, but this particular model needs more work.",

I have an HP dv6000, and like most notebook owners, my computer performance is fast, but not spectacular, lying somewhere in the middle.  The HP battery monitoring system (i.e., little battery icon in the system tray) grossly OVER-estimates the charge level.  The battery holds charge for about an hour, then rapidly descends off a cliff.  THE ANNOYING THING is that my battery slips past the HP power management system, which is configured to give me a warning when I have 10% power remaining.  The result: my laptop unexpectedly and ungracefully blacks-out in the middle of operation!      Taking a closer look at the design, the shape of the battery pack casing (with its glorious external row for extra life) looks like it contains rechargeable AA cells.  It's hard to believe that this battery is a Li-Ion, or maybe it is of cheaper quality; so much so, that it is apparently foreign to my HP power management system.  The previous battery that I purchased (for $90) was not great either, lasting only a year, but was recognizable enough that my system was able to accurately estimate the remaining charge level.     So I regret to say that it may be worth shoveling out the extra cash on a certified HP battery.  Sometimes the peace of mind and quality is worth the added cost (at least to me).  With the money I have wasted over the past year, I could have already purchased an HP battery which lasted me 2 years.",
