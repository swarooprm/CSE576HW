Not in my book.  Plus, the Skiller offers more customization profiles and keys, period.<br /><br />My only complaint about the Skiller is a token one, as mine arrived with several of the special optional rubberized keys (for A/S/D/W and the arrow keys) crushed and unusable due to shipping conditions.  However, after e-mailing Sharkoon directly about the issue, a full set of replacements arrived almost immediately thereafter in the mail, free of charge.<br /><br />Honestly, I've take more than a few spins with $100+ keyboards in my time, including the Logitech K800 (more of a high-quality/luxury keyboard than gaming-specific) and mechanical G-series offerings.  And while those keyboards are indeed quite nice, that price tag they carry is more than a little bloated......Sharkoon Skiller on the other hand ihas been very modestly priced, so much so that I hope that Logitech and other manufacturers take note of how much functionality has been packed in at this price point (the only thing it is missing is wireless operation).<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone seeking a programmable keyboard, one with extensive pre-set media/computer controls (i.e., volume up/down, Play/Pause/Previous/Next, and even internet controls like Forward/Back/Refresh), and/or anyone looking for a premium keyboard priced like a discount one.",

It's just that once you get the thing it's obvious that you've overpaid.  It's more or less one of those little things you have on your desk to hold the mail with a few USB ports and an ac adaptor.  There is nothing stunning about the technology or design and the plastic is light weight to the point were I am worried about breaking it.  The worst part is realizing that now that I've coughed up darn near a Benjamin on this thing I now need to go buy the 5 lighting cables required to transfer the juice...  Anyone that has goofed around with those things knows that you can't buy one for less the $20 if you want it to last longer then about a week.  Another problem is that for this thing to really serve it's purpose (for me this was to reduce cable clutter and save space on my desk) it really needs lightning cables that are around maybe 6 inches or less, which as far as I can tell don't exist.  As it is now, once you get all five 1 meter cables plugged in you are really just back where you started, a rats nest of wires.  Giffin needs to either cut the price by at least half or include the right sized cables as part of the package, maybe even both.<br /><br />I'm usually pretty forgiving on my reviews but this product left me feeling beat like a garage sale sofa.  This one is a no go.<br /><br />Update - Griffin did stand behind their product and allowed me a return with full refund minus return shipping.",

Not to get into the weeds, be sure and get the 8GB of DDR3 RAM if you buy this system; seen them with 8GB but they were DDR2, and that is not as fast as DDR3 which is usually the RAM on video boards rather than system RAM.

Yes, you can download apps from Amazon and Applib but the touchscreen is honestly just not good enough to do many things with.  Maybe it is just me but I feel like I am using a good performing tablet with a 10 year old screen.  It looks great but the reflexive technology is frustrating to most when compared to current capacitive technology.  With that in mind, I recommend it but only if you have realistic expectations.  I use mine for ebook reading, watching my own ripped DVD's, and surfing the netflix queue.  It was affordable enough that I let my three year old play with it unsupervised but she gets frustrated with the screen after a short time.

Fit is outstanding though, things line up way better than the overpriced Apple case that I have (and really dislike).

Cutout for speakers, dock, earphone jack, and rotation lock.  Volume is like the power button, not cut out, but has a raised feel there.  Up works fine, but the down can be a bit tricky sometimes.  Raised edge protects it if you set it face down on a flat surface too, keeps the screen from coming in contact.<br />The slightly grippier feel doesn't impact it from sliding in and out of my macbook pro bag either.<br /><br />For the price, great product, fits extremely well, does not move around or feel loose at all.

I had owned another 17 inch Inspirion for 5 years before that, and again, had paid over 1000 for it. This freaking thing IS A STEAL!!!! First, I can't tell any difference in screen size. I feel just as comfortable with it and do not miss the extra inch and a half of screen at all. As a matter of fact, I enjoy the much thinner thickness and it is much lighter. Win 8.1 takes a bit of getting used to, and navigating it has some quirks, but that has nothing to do with the machine, just typical Microsoft stuff. As far as I'm concerned the this machine processes fast and I have no problem with a few apps running at once. Like someone else indicated, the touchpad is as skittish as a piglet at a barbecue - come near it and it jumps. But you can adjust the sensitivity somewhat and I can live with it. But man, all of the features I paid over 1g for before, I now have for less than $400, PLUS I get Bluetooth AND a touchscreen!!! Jackpot!!!!!. Don't wait, just buy it.",

            "input": "This Kindle was purchased for a person in her 90s with disabilities.  The reader has the use of the right side of her body only.  She is a avid reader.<br />  The PagePress page forward & page back control works extremely well for her. The haptic feedback also works well.  We set PagePress at minimum (most sensitive) and feedback at maximum (most feedback).  She is able to tell immediately when she has advanced multiple pages and can quickly page back.<br />  The light level, text contrast and automatic adaptive light level work extremely well for her.  The adaptive font size works extremely well for her. There is some inconsistency in font size and publisher selected font style between books.  This requires assistance from her care giver when a new book is selected.  There is also an info page that appears when opening a new book.  This is annoying.  I like the feature, but would prefer that it could be controlled and turned off in settings.<br />  I have an iPad with the Kindle app.  This reader is unable to control the Kindle app features.  The iPad is usable but requires much more care giver assistance than the Kindle Voyage.  I tried the Nook app on an iPad with no better success.  The iPad apps were barely usable.  We tried using a laptop with eReader apps.  The laptop required too much keystroke & mouse action.  We were continuously trying to re-open the app and recover the book.  The laptop apps were vetoed by the caregivers.  We tried a Nook tablet.  The Nook requires additional keystrokes plus knowledge of where the appropriate key is, where to press and where to swipe.  The Kindle Voyage is by far easier to use and easier on the caregiver.<br />  We purchased the Kindle Unlimited service.  This service includes many authors that I have never read and never heard of.  On the other hand, it is a surprise what a 90 year old finds interesting.  It is easy for a caregiver to download a selection of ebooks and use the Goodreads to keep track of completed books.We have access to two large metro area library system that includes a large ebook catalog (Phoenix & Detroit).  This is useless.  There are a limited number of copies of each ebook.  The reader has  favorite authors.  The library indeed has ebooks by these authors.  They are typically checked out.  An avid reader might queue and wait.  A caregiver has less patience for this nonsense.<br /><br />  The senior living facility warned us that electronic items disappear, if unattended. We purchased a CTA anti-theft stand (PAD-UATGS).  This device has a key lock and bike cable.  We attached the Kindle to her work table.  The stand is very nice, the cable has adequate length.  You could purchase a bike anti-theft cable as an extension.  HOWEVER, the Kindle Voyager does not fit this stand - contrary to the CTA product claim and the video that some fellow included on the Amazon page for this product.  I created a wooden frame using a hobby oak wood strip (0.25&#34;x1.5&#34;x48&#34;) from Home Depot.  The frame is essentially a picture frame that captures the Kindle and in turn is captured by the CTA stand.  Cost $7.50 and 2 hours labor, including design time and sanding.  Home Depot offers oak, alder & linden strips  The frame looks very nice in oak. Note: Oak wood dust is a skin, eye and lung irritant. Alder wood dust is also.  Sand in a well ventilated area.<br />  Amazon Kindle or CTA could easily create a product to secure the Voyage and smaller tablets to a stand.  HINT.",

I tug it around for all my personal stuff and it is light, easy to carry (CaseLogic Bag) and I really do get 10 hours plus use of the battery. My biggest concern was how I would handle a smaller keyboard. For regular typing, the keyboard has worked well. Navigating with the arrow keys and the Fn function key took some time to get used to. I'm 50+ years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for. I have had a freeze up twice where the mouse and keyboard stop responding.

But I do buy on sale so I often have one below the \\\\\"best\\\\\". This time I ended up with a Webcam C510.<br /><br />At first I thought that since the lense wasn't glass that the picture probably wouldn't be as good as the Logitech c905 that I currently have. But, the C510 has a much better picture. I guess the sensor and processing improvements mean more than the lense, at least in webcams.<br /><br />This webcam is better in low light, has a sharper picture in normal light, and it folds up nice an neat without needing a case.<br /><br />I also like the way it attaches to my desktop better than the C905. It's not perfect, but I didn't like that I needed a dumb stand to use the C905 with my desktop. Unfortunately, the C510 likes a thicker screen, so it doesn't attach as well to laptops. It will often stay, but if the laptop is bumped it may fall. You can fold the camera so that it is its own stand and that works well even if it won't stick on the screen. I guess the clip is the one thing I would change.<br /><br />So I like the webcam a lot and it works well. I'd definately suggest it.",

I don't know what they did, but I've have the replacement for a few months now, and the feet are exactly where they should be. I've had no problems whatsoever with the case.   It's a minor fingerprint magnet, but not really, and I'm a lot less worried about carrying my MacBook about.   Old review: -------   I bought this because I was happy with my last MoKo purchase, and because it was the cheapest case on offer.  Shipped in a padded envelope, the two halves were shrinkwrapped together with a second layer on shrinkwrap on the top half, and a chunk of plastic in the middle to separate the two halves. There was a little thin plastic fluff on the feet that wiped off easily.  There are no instructions, but it's easy to figure out. Installation is trivial.  The case is well made, and should do the job. The smoke finish looks good on the space grey finish. It doesn't look like it will fall off. The plastics have a sort of &#34;soft touch&#34; matte finish.  Edit: removed two stars. The rubber feet are not well attached. So far, I've been lucky enough to find them and stick them back on, but eventually, I'll be missing feet. I find this very annoying. I don't know if the other cases are better at retaining their feet, but I'll probably find out once this one starts losing feet for real.",

The iPad is a slim, elegant tablet and I expect a case or cover that will complement it. The IFOL-202 is none of those things. For starters it's big and bulky. There's no clasp or elastic to keep the cover closed so it's usually flapping around unless you keep your fingers on it.    The outside of the case if made of a rough nylon material. Tough most certainly, but out of place on an iPad. There are really two parts to this case. A small inner sleeve that the iPad fits into that then attaches with velcro to the exterior shell. This makes it possible to use the case as a stand in both portrait and landscape mode. But lifting and reposition the iPad is a pain and and not nearly as elegant as the [[ASIN:B004N62HZI Targus Versavu 360 Degrees Rotating Stand Case for Apple iPad 2 2nd Generation Wifi / 3G Model 16GB, 32GB, 64GB THZ045US NEWEST MODEL (Black/Blue Interior)]]. To close the case you need to make sure the iPad is attached in landscape mode    The sleeve and case are not designed to fit \\\\\"like a glove\\\\\" and the fit overall is okbut not spectacular. The inner iPad sleeve isn't quite snug and the part that overlaps the iPad by about 1/2\\\\\" doesn't always sit snugly against the surface.

A 99% pick-up from a medium distanced signal was able to transmit at 150Mbs and streamed a full length Netflix movie without effort or issue!   As the costs continue to decrease and the quality continues to increase, this is even a viable alternative for adding older, addition traditional PCs in the house to the network versus running cat5 line.

As for how well it's made it fits the kindle touch snugly. The elastic straps seem to hold the kindle in place very well. I have never used a kindle case before and thought the kindle would fall out of those straps, but after trying it. I think the chances of that happening are really slim. The hand strap also seems fairly safe. The front and back covers are somewhat hard. So I think it should protect your kindle pretty well. The pocket on the front is the size of the cover so you could use it for lots of things. I am very happy with this purchase and I'm sure my mother will be very pleased with her gift.",

Our installation was with an IBM ThinkPad T40P, a laptop that has an integral Bluetooth radio. We were interested in using this mouse *without* the Microsoft-provided USB-attached transceiver. <br />Initial experimentation with the T40P and the Windows XP Bluetooth attachment wizard produced a good result. We had to trial several speed settings before being satisfied. The optical sensor performance is not as good as Microsoft's tethered Intellimouse products. It is fussier about the surface quality. <br />We were interested in trying the Intellipoint (4.9) software. It offers a variety of additional customizations that will be helpful to some users. But sadly, this is where it all goes wrong with the ThinkPad T40P. The software installs fine but is incompatible with IBM's UltraNav drivers and removes them upon installation.<br />The IntelliMouse software is wonderful, but the IBM ThinkPad UltraNav drivers that control the builtin pointing-stick and touch-pad devices are replaced by Microsoft's own generic--far less robust--versions. <br />While the hardware still functions, forget about using the keyboard without having the cursor jump randomly to another part of the screen during routine typing. You'll think (and eventually scream at the PC in horror), &quot;what the heck is going on here?&quot;  UltraNav obviously includes critical and specifically tuned debounce performance that was overlooked in Microsoft's replacement drivers.<br />The ideal solution would be to have the peaceful coexistance UltraNav for the IBM hardware and Intellipoint 4.9 for the Bluetooth mouse, but alas that combination is not easily achieved.<br />As for the question of whether the Bluetooth Intellimouse works without Microsoft's transceiver on the ThinkPad T40P, the answer is &quot;yes.&quot; If the Intellipoint software is going to back out your PC's hardware-specific device drivers, you probably shouldn't install it, and you'll just have to do without it.",

I've always been a fan of books, but the lack of selection in Shanghai for english-language books, and the high prices (unless I stumble upon a book peddler on the street)left little time or incentive to keep up on my reading.    The Kindle Wifi was a great purchase, I've rarely been this satisfied with a product. It's great to use, and as another reviewer noted, it is actually much easier and more pleasant to read on then a \\\\\"real\\\\\" book, due to its size, light weight, the fact that you can operate it with just one hand to turn pages etc. The increasing font size is also great for those who like to read while doing cardio at the gym.    I decided to purchase the WiFi because Target didn't have the 3g in stock. I think the WiFi is great for most people's usage, I just purchase books off amazon and load to my Kindle via USB. After, all there's never been a moment when I saw a book, and NEEDED to read it right at that moment (which you could do with the 3G). However, one small caveat that the WiFi suffers compared to the 3G is for magazine subscriptions. If you purchase a magazine subscription, you can only get it streamed wirelessly to the kindle, I haven't been able to load it to my computer. Hence, unless I am in a wi-fi area every day, i miss out on some magazine issues.",

I bought this laptop to replace my old dying one as a junior at UC Berkeley studying econ. This laptop is small and fast (using STATA and other econometrics and statistical analysis programs are really fast). The battery lasts 4-8 hours depending on use. If you're listening to music, writing a paper and reading .pdfs the battery will last around 6.5 hours. If I'm just reading a .pdf it will last 8 hours. The trackpad on this is pretty bad, it was almost unusable when I opened the box. The program allowed me to tweak the settings and it's much better but not perfect. The screen on this isn't very good. It's hard to use outdoors in bright sun (it's doable but not as easy as more expensive laptops). Also the bezel around the keyboard scratches really easily. Overall, this is a perfect laptop because I paid $600 and I expected it to come with flaws, and these flaws are very minimal for the specs and overall quality.",

I didn't know whether to pull the trigger and go for the  13 inch, but I am glad I ended up getting this size, which is perhaps some people's biggest reservation, an 11.6 inch screen. I can tell you that Lion makes having a smaller screen seem completely fine. Just spend a few minutes learning how to use the gestures, understand the value of full-screening certain applications (Mail, iTunes, Safari, etc.), and you can switch back and forth between items seamlessly.  I think that having at least 128gb is a must. I can't imagine having anything smaller, but the cloud and external media make 128gb a fine choice. The SSD drive is fast, very fast. This is the first computer I have owned with one, and I don't think I will ever be able to go back. I have the latest generation 21.5 inch iMac at work, and this seems to blow that out of the water. I know there is speculation out there about the Samsung and Toshiba drives, but I got a Samsung drive (the \\\\\"faster\\\\\" one), so this has not been an issue for me.

Then I discovered that in order to reliably ensure pictures are transferred you effectively need to disable the auto-shut off feature of your camera. Doing this has resulted in several occasions when I pulled out my camera to take a picture and the battery was dead. This alone made me pull the card and put it back in the box.

The cover also has the Wake and Sleep function; meaning when the cover is opened the tablet turns on and turns off when the cover is closed which saves battery life. Other cases that do not have this feature simply stay-on even when the cover is closed. There is a dual zipper and pen/stylus combination which is nice...the pen writes in blue ink when turned clockwise and black ink when turned counter-clockwise.Although I gave this case 5 stars...I wish there more color options (like saddle brown added) and the quality of the leather could have been higher...which is a minor quibble considering the functional aspects this case offers.",

This might not bother some folks, but I know me, and I could see my eyes wandering to it all the time. I might as well have retitled all my books to THERE'S THAT SPOT AGAIN, VOLUMES ONE THROUGH INFINITY. So I contacted CS, and the lady I chatted with was on it like a champ, issuing me a new Paperwhite straight away. She was awesome. She should get a raise. And a free Paperwhite. You can totally give her the one I just mailed back! Maybe the spot won't bother her.<br /><br />Anyway, I just got the replacement, and as soon as I turned it on another spot was all \\\\\"Hey, bud, can I crash? Cool! Hope ya don't mind, I brought a couple of friends!\\\\\" Yeah. Three pinhole leaks. Also, the replacement seems a bit cloudier at the bottom edge. I had to flip it over and check to see if I got the new one with the Amazon logo and not the old one with the Kindle logo. Also-also, there's a teeny-tiny black dot permanently showing on the bottom left corner, like a stuck piece of e-ink. My stellar luck with electronics continues!<br /><br />I suppose I could send this one back, too, but I haven't even put the first one in the mail yet. Besides, what would be the point? So I can get a new one with a constellation of light leaks and a dinosaur shadow puppet on the bottom edge? I mean, this is where it's obviously heading. I'm just gonna keep it, and each time I see one of those spots (which will be every single time I look at the screen), they will serve as a twinkling reminder not to order electronics online. Sort of like shooting stars, only instead of making a wish I will sharply hiss a curse word under my breath.<br /><br />I just don't think their QA is very Q. I imagine they basically just turn it on, mark off the \\\\\"I saw a bunch of words\\\\\" box on the checklist, and pack it up. Clearly they don't give a flip about it once it leaves the warehouse, otherwise they'd use an actual shipping box instead of just slapping mailing labels all over the retail box. My first one looked as if someone had goal-kicked it onto the UPS truck. Nice job, Pel\u00e9. You're a legend.<br /><br />Features? Yeah, they're okay, I guess. Page flip is nice. Footnotes are finally something useful instead of something dreadful. The front light has...kinda-sorta been \\\\\"fixed.\\\\\" By that I mean the \\\\\"shadowing\\\\\" at the bottom is still there, just very faint.  It no longer looks like a flashlight being held under someone's chin in a dark room, is what I am saying. It will absolutely not look like that hilariously optimistic dazzling white mockup on the store page. When you jack the light all the way up, the e-ink washes out a little. After about three or four page turns, you might find that Page Flip is somewhat unnecessary, as you'll still be able to read the previous pages via all the ghosted text. Page turns are fast, I'll give them that. So that's a thing. You can do all kinds of turning pages in a fast way.<br /><br />I mean, it's all right, all things considered. I don't know how enthusiastic I should be about it. I mean, let's not get crazy, it's an ereader with a light. So you can read in the dark without using a lamp or a torch or your zippo or whatever. I got a couple of bad ones. You might get a good one.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this was helpful. Actually, I don't really care, I'm just blowing off some steam. I know some hysterical types will consider this review a deeply personal attack instead of a product critique, and the laughs that will bring make me feel a little better about my bad gadget luck, so thanks for that.  Now I'm gonna go see if I can make out the Little Dipper on my Paperwhite screen.",

It was slow, everything was crashing, couldn't download apps or do much of anything at all and the interface was kinda gross.<br />Then I found out there was an update to 4.1 Ice Cream Sandwich available, took it, and the tablet is pretty much perfect now.<br />The speakers are fantastic, the screen is beautiful and the size and weight are just perfect for me. I do think it's annoying that it doesn't charge from microusb but I guess it doesn't matter as long as I have the right charger.

After a single adjustment on both screens there was no necessity to make further adjustments and I do not find it necessary to switch \\\\\"off\\\\\" the monitors when the computer shuts down. Access to the controls was not an issue and the pedestals are more than sufficient for proper support. The color, clarity and performance is excellent.    I purchased two of the 27\\\\\" - ViewSonic monitors which is a wonderful experience after using a single monitor set-up. With dual monitors your ability to perform multiple functions on your computer is greatly enhanced. I performed an extensive amount of research prior to my purchase. The experts who reviewed and graded this monitor, and in comparisons with many other top name manufacturers of monitors, found the ViewSonic to be an excellent choice. In fact the ViewSonic was much less expensive and graded equivalent and sometimes better than other comparison monitors.    Much of the testing and evaluations performed by the experts was related to the following: Maximum Black Luminance; maximum contract ratio; gray scale error; gamma value range; average gamma; color gamut error and screen uniformity. All of this testing is way above my understanding but it was helpful to know the experts who tested this monitor gave it a high rating. In fact - after grading the ViewSonic on 17 specific tests it scored higher than other well known brands in 9 of the 17 tests. I use an external Altec Lansing speaker system and consequently do not use the integrated monitor speakers. So, I cannot comment on the speaker system which is incorporated in the monitor.  For general purpose use and gaming this is a very good choice for a monitor in this price range especially in consideration of the three (3) year parts and labor warranty provided by ViewSonic. I highly recommend this monitor.",

A nice bonus is the fact that the external sound card removes some of the processing load from the microprocessor in the laptop.  All connections, so far, have been made using the analog connections - in the future, I'll also be testing the digital input/output connections.  As a suggestion to others trying this for portable DJ-ing, I recommend adding a powered USB hub (about 5 bucks here on Amazon) so that the sound card, DJ mixing hardware, and other USB components are not pulling their electrical power from the PC's USB connection.<br /><br />When I'm not DJ-ing, I also use this same sound card to play surround-sound movies on my laptop.",

You could get a more powerful Wintel laptop for half the money.  I realize that is sacrilege to MAC OS guru's.  But the fact is as easy and solid as apple tries to make OS X and MAC hardware they both still have some issues.  - Both versions of the mac air I use and a MAC pro I also use constantly drop WIFI.  While non-mac laptops attached to the same WAP do not drop.  The frustrating thing is the apple goes out of their way to hide all of the real advanced settings that may actually fix the issue.  I understand they want to make these things like a toaster and thats fine, but some time you need to open the \\\\\"hood\\\\\" and fiddle with the \\\\\"engine\\\\\".  OS X is based on a UNIX variant and I have been working on various UNIX flavors for 16 years, I am no stranger to UNIX OS's.  But even at the CLI level they hide many of the advanced tools that one could use if one should run into an issue.  Of course you can pack the thing up and take it to the genius bar, which may cost you money.  BTW in windows or linux you are able to get to the advanced settings easily enough if needed.  -  As much as I don't love windows because of its instability, make no mistake OS X is not immune.  While it is overall more stable than windows 7 it does have its moments of instability.  Run it too hard or open too many windows it can freeze or hang.  Matter of fact I notice when I run the airs and the pro hard I see bluetooth devices loose connectivity, especially the mouse, and the only way to get it back is to reboot.  Wait I thought windows only did that, well OS X does too unfortunately, albeit not as much.  - OSX still is safer than windows as far as viruses go, but that is because there are more virus written for windows.  IT is not because OS X is immune.  Purchasing virus software is a good idea.  -  Software is stillkind of limited for the Mac, and the ones that are available are usually pricy.  Sometimes I just want to play a game, but most of the good ones run on windows.  If you are not  a gamer or power user and just want something to surf the net why pay the big bucks when you can get a Acer for under $400.  I can ramble all day with the comparisons but end of the day the Mac air is a cool device and sleek but I wouldn't dole out my money for it.",

Then I experimented and installed the Soundblaster Z, since I had been extremely happy for years with an \\\\\"underpowered\\\\\" $200 Asus Xonar card (which is based on Creative).  The Z also works great with my Senns, but the value is that the software customizes the sound to a further degree!  My headphones are legendary neutral so they're the perfect cans to mess around with an equalizer.  I flavor to taste and music genre.  The amp also drives them better than the mobo chip.  The headphone is more dynamic.    I also tried the Fiio E09k/E17.  Good sound as well, but I still preferred the EXTENDED flavorization/customizability of the SB software.  The Z's a cheaper product to begin with and also less desktop clutter as it's an internal sound card.  That said, you can't go wrong with the Fiio if that's the route you want to take, as it has a great DAC/amp.

I especially like the PSU at the bottom of the case so it can draw fresh air in, instead of the pre-heated air inside the case. Heat causes you PSU to be less efficient, and shortens it's lifespan. As far as heat inside the case, there should be very little due to the presence of three large fans (front, top, and rear). The option to install a couple more on the side is nice, but I don't think that will be necessary... even with my crossfired HD3850's. There's 11\\\\\" of space where my PCI-E slots are located (my vid cards are 9 1/8\\\\\"), so long video cards have plenty of room to breathe. I could easily fit my pair of HD3870 X2's (10 1/2\\\\\" x 1 5/8\\\\\" each) in this case. Cable management is pretty nice when it comes to keeping things neat and tidy, too. The front fan cools the HDD(s), while the top and rear fans exhaust the heat that my video cards dump into the case. RAM sits directly below the outer edge of the top fan, so air will be drawn the length of the modules, instead of across them. I wasn't sure I'd like the tool-less design for the HDD(s), but these things are very tight and secure. Someone complained about plastic screws holding the side panels on... this isn't the case. The screws are metal Phillips screws with large plastic, knurled heads. There's even a slot across the top of the heads so in case you overtighten them and can't unscrew them by hand, and you don't have a Phillips screwdriver, but you DO have a dime in your pocket... you're good. All in all, I am extremely happy with this case. If you're looking for a well-built case that's got plenty of space for your components and good airflow to keep things cool, this is the case for you.<br /><br />PS: I ordered it on 9/19/11, and it was delivered by noon on 9/20/11!

Logitech tech support never returned my emails. So, I went to a local retailer where the \\\\\"geek\\\\\" (hint, hint) there told me my situation was a common problem with the Mx518. I was advised to connect the mouse directly to the mouse port in the back of my computer ( PS/2 not the usb) and see what happened.  So, I  hooked up the mouse to the \\\\\"old fashion\\\\\", PS/2 mouse port in the back of my computer tower and it has been fine ever since (about 2 weeks now).  After the initial \\\\\"troubleshooting\\\\\" I am very please with this mouse.  However, I doubt I would purchase this same model again due to its issues with the usb ports.  ****August 2007 Update: the thumb browser \\\\\"back\\\\\" button has stopped working.  So far 1 week and several efforts, but no reply from Logitech Warranty/Support****",

I was hoping to see some performance improvement going from USB-2.0 to USB-3.0 with this external drive, but no joy!     This WD drive supports both USB-2.0 and USB-3.0. Using it on USB-2.0 was fine and performance was average for an external USB-2.0 drive.    In moving it over to USB-3.0, I was curious to see what my real world performance boost would be. I don't find much practical value in those speedtest bench marks that move small chunks of data and test all sections of the drive. They don't give meaningful indication of what happens with large video files. (After all isn't that the reason you buy a Terabyte drive?)    I measured transfer rates for both USB-2.0 and USB-3.0 speeds using two sample video files. One sample was 1.0 GB and one was 2.0 GB. Here are my results using the USB-3.0 cable supplied with the WD drive:  USB-2.0: 1.0 GB file = 184 Mbps (42 seconds)  USB-2.0: 2.0 GB file = 176 Mbps (90 seconds)  USB-3.0: 1.0 GB file = 176 Mbps (44 seconds)  USB-3.0: 2.0 GB file = 160 Mbps (100 seconds)    This is not very impressive, as the speed actually dropped by using USB-3.0. I should note that I don't have a old, slow PC. It is a 2010 HP Win7 64bit with Core2 Quad 3.0 GHz (Yorkfield). I moved my files from an internal Barracuda drive connected with SATA that is significantly faster than any external drive. By comparison the same two files can be moved between two internal drives (SATA) on this machine in 12 and 19 seconds respectively (666 Mbps and 842 Mbps).    If moving big files matters to you, you'll probably see no improvement using this USB-3.0 card. Honestly, I can't tell if the poor performance is because of the WD USB-3.0 implementation or because of the Buffalo USB-3.0 interface card, but the combination does not live up to the hype.    UPDATE: I updated the rating to 4 stars. After installing a second USB-3.0 externaldrive, a new driver was apparently installed by the new drive that must have fixed what ever problems I was having. The new drive is performing very well with the same 2.0 GB file now loading in about 22 seconds!  This comes to about 742 Mbps, which is very respectable.",

I rush home with my new, almost six-hundred dollar Dell monitor and plug it into my new dual-DVI port video card. \u201cGreat Scott\u201d, I proclaim! All I'm getting on my new, almost six-hundred dollar Dell monitor is a small rectangular box bouncing across my screen which states, \u201cNo VGA cable attached\u201d! I've never had this problem with a monitor in the past. I normally just plug it into the video card port and it works. What is wrong here? I did all my research and studied the many new DVI configurations and what is compatible with what. So, knowing that technology marches forward (because they can't leave well enough alone), I also know that things are usually made to be backward-compatible. Right? Then I find, in the dark recesses of the internet, something about a new technology called HDCP. I read on. Instead of exclaiming, \u201cGreat Scott\u201d, I now exclaim, \u201cWhat the f...\u201d! Because my new, almost six-hundred dollar Dell monitor makes barely a mention of HDCP compliance, never mind explaining the technology and what is required of the consumer who purchases this grand new technology. I learn that this new technology was developed by Intel and adopted by Dell, no doubt, to protect them from evil consumers such as myself. So, even though my new almost six-hundred dollar monitor has been capable of displaying graphics with all the technological savvy of a Pong game interface, it is currently sitting upside-down and backwards (because they can't seem to put the connections anywhere convenient) on my floor until I either do more research into what will make it work for me (because apparently Dell can't make things backward-compatible), or, I can blindly keep spending my money on products until something does work. But, I'm happy that you have seen fit to protect yourselves from the likes of people like me. How about just a clue, Dell, that the monitor will not operate with anything other than another HDCP compliant device! I will never purchase another Dell product or anything HDCP-compliant!

Its a nice tablet and though its not as responsive as an apple product it does a very good job on the performance side of the house. When reviewing a movie on this device it was clear and just the right size when holding at the table. Seems like the battery last a long time as far as messing around on the app portion but not sure about watching movies back to back yet.<br /><br />For Parents: I was a little worried when I added my prime login to this device because it saves your password and username for convenience I assume to purchase from amazon.com. It does have a parental lock on the device under settings to lock on the ability for children to get onto the shopping at amazon app all together. This takes that &#34;did my child just max my card because he/she accidentally or on purpose ordered 300 different toys while messing around on amazon&#34;. You can also lock out purchasing apps, movies, etc. so you know what your child is doing on the web and he/she wont accidentally review something they should not.<br /><br />The only odd thing is with the parental lock is that when you set it and put your password in to unlock so you can use the locked apps it takes you back to the settings and you have to unlock those and save it. This scares me a little because I have to remember to lock them back after I am done.  I just got this device so maybe I havent figured out how to let it just take my password and not have to adjust the settings and save. In a perfect world It would take the password and move forward then once I log out of the app the lock is automatically put back in place.<br /><br />Overall good product, I am happy with the tablet :D! Cheers Amazon!",

            "input": "I'm using a MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) running OSX 10.10 Yosemite, which only has one thunderbolt port for video out.  I write code professionally, and wanted to have 2 monitors and my laptop screen to do so.  I don't need it to be low-lag, or have super high framerates, but I do need high resolution so I can display lots of text.  This adapter does that (at 1920x1080 at 60 FPS as claimed), but not perfectly.<br /><br />Firstly, you have to download/install drivers from their site, plugging in the adapter without them does nothing.  This isn't a problem for someone like me, but may confuse new users, especially people who are used to Macs, since most Mac hardware is plug-and-play with no custom driver installs.  On the plus side, the drivers were updated last week, which means they're being actively worked on, so the bugs I'm about to mention may be resolved later on with new drivers.<br /><br />On to the bugs:<br />If you want to do triple-monitors on a Macbook Air, you'll need to plug in this adapter AFTER you plug in the thunderbolt adapter, or the drivers freak out, use 100% CPU, and your framerate becomes terrible with visible tearing and artifacting.  Fortunately, when waking up from sleep this doesn't become an issue, and it takes 2 seconds to unplug/replug if you do it wrong.<br /><br />Other than that, by far the biggest bug is that Mission Control (which I use constantly to switch windows) does not get along with the adapter.  When it's plugged in, Mission Control causes the screen to freeze for 3-5 seconds before showing you the overview, though this can be significantly cut down if you run<br />defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0<br />in a terminal.  This removes the animation at the start and end of Mission Control, though, which makes finding windows slightly harder, but makes mission control launch in a sane amount of time.<br /><br />Also, if you want to use the adapter-connected monitor as your main monitor, the menubar loses transparency and can lose all its text, though it is still functional.  Additionally, some applications (specifically Intellij Idea) don't like it when you use the adapter-connected monitor as your main, though they will run fine and display fine on that monitor if it's set up as a secondary.<br /><br />There is also the minor issue of antialiasing not working in Mission Control, meaning text looks weird in the overview.  Also, 10.10's new transparency stuff is glitchy and causes some weird colorations and small black/white squares sometimes, but you can disable it to remove this effect. [EDIT:] I have discovered that disabling transparency significantly improves performance of apps on the connected monitor.  The setting is under System Preferences->Accessibility->Display->Reduce Transparency.<br /><br />Lastly, though it does claim to be 60FPS (and looks like it actually is) there is a slight lag (maybe 3 or 4 frames) on the picture.  For work, this is not an issue, but if you're wanting to use it for gaming (especially with a single game spanning two monitors), it would be very noticeable and problematic.  The adapter gets warm while in use, which leads me to believe that there's some sort of processing going on, which is probably causing the lag, so this may not be something the driver updates could fix.",

What the (exceptionally strong) magnet does do, is keep the case closed, and keep the back folded over as a stand when you want to use it that way.

STILL had jittery video in that system, until MSI released a driver update which finally cured the condition. The cards should perform well now in most any system. I was using 2 dual core socket 775 systems at the time, and currently the MSI cards reside with a QX 6850 processor on an Abit IP 35 Pro  motherboard..",

I've told everyone I know about them when they've commented on the look and feel of the screen.<br /><br />I've used the same Matte Clear screen protector on iPads (2,3,4) , iPhone 4,4S,5 & 5S. All have the fantastic feel and they resist fingerprints very well. I have about 18 different orders for MediaDevil screen protectors from Amazon (I just checked).<br /><br />Normally, I'm the one who applies the screen protectors. I was out of town so my wife did it on our 2 new iPad Mini's. The ones I've received are definitely not Matte. The fingerprints show up immediately and the screen itself is smooth rather than that nice matte feel I've gotten on the other ones. Essential it's the Crystal Clear edition in my mind.<br /><br />Mediadevil has always been fantastic when I've needed to deal with a problem. This time however they've told me that they've changed the material. I would think that if the material had changed it would warrant an update or new SKU on Amazon so people at least know.<br /><br />To say I'm disappointed about the quality and response I've gotten from Mediadevil would be an understatement.  Here is the quote from the email.<br /><br />&#34;I'm sorry to hear that you're not entirely happy with your Matte Clear iPad Mini screen protectors. Due to the increasing PPI of touch screen devices over the last couple of years we decided to update our matte material earlier this year, in order to ensure that the material strikes the best possible balance between the reduction of the glare from the backlit screen and the caused pixellation of the screen clarity. &#34;<br /><br />Even in their description they talk about the reduced pixelation of the screens and the Matte finish, &#34;If you require a perfectly 'crystal clear' screen to enjoy the screen clarity to its full extent, we strongly recommend purchasing our (glossy surface textured) Magicscreen Crystal Clear edition instead&#34;<br /><br />Maybe the person I talked with is mistaken. Maybe I was just sent the wrong version. I'm not sure. Either she totally made up the line about the updating of the Matte finish or they changed the product yet didn't tell anyone about it.",

The color and black level is superb. Setup is a snap as well with only two connections on the entire display; plug in the power and the Display Port connector (to a display port output only of course) and it worked immediately. The best part about the monitor is it's small footprint. Overall I gained roughly 6 inches of space on my relatively shallow desk. If you are pressed for space this is a fantastic monitor to consider.<br /><br />The only downside to it is the fact that it does not handle resolutions below 1920x1080 very well. Text looks blocky and distorted whenever the display is not run at it's native resolution. As the Mac Mini that I have it hooked to is a Late 2009 model this can be problematic when attempting to run games at playable resolutions. If you buy this monitor make sure that your computer won't have any trouble running things at the full native resolution.<br /><br />Other than that this is a fantastic display well worth the price!",

Not a major flaw but it is slightly annoying for those of us with OCD.<br /><br />As a case, it functions well. The magnetic wake/lock works as expected, the stand grips enough that the Kindle doesn't slide and the strap to keeps it closed does just that.

The support site suggested sending in the laptop for repair, which I could expect from an older laptop, not a brand new one.<br /><br />The seller answered my questions before the purchase. The shipping was fast and the laptop was in flawless condition, but I didn't receive a response from the seller the day I received the laptop, when I brought the issue up to them. After a weekend and 48 hrs without a response, I filed an Amazon claim, which was fast and easy.<br /><br />All in all, it was a disappointment. Great machine with all the bells and whistles, but one fundamental communications component ruined the experience. Though, if you don't need to rely on the wireless card, this is a great machine.",

Now, it's not a serious distraction but it's a distraction nonetheless.  It appears there is a darkened area that invades the bottom of the reading pane and extends down to the bottom of the page.  Again, it doesn't interfere with reading, or counting pages, but it really shouldn't be there.  This is, after all, an Amazon product, a highly touted one, and I warrant that Apple wouldn't let anything out of their sweatshops that had such a glaring defect.

I did a quick check on my android phone for it and quickly decided it was worth a try. The store was selling it for $88. I've used it for a week now and I'm very impressed with it. The device is built rugged with an aluminum case. It is light weight and has a nice feel in the hands. It has a resistive touch display. I recommend using the stylist over your finger tip, unless you have long finger nail. Then your finger nail would make an excellent stylist. In most cases your finger tip will work. But if you have a light touch. The stylist will be more functional for you. This is common with ALL resistive displays. Battery life has been as reported in the specs. It was very easy to setup. The only setup was connecting to WIFI and email. The true test of any PC is how well it plays games and videos. Both tax the processor, memory, and display drivers. It plays games very well with no jerkiness in the frame rate. Videos play clean and the sound is good. The display on this unit is 800x400. Which is to be expected for this price point. The display is sharp. Graphics and videos look very good. Its not the brightest display. Yet it is easy to watch directly under florescent lights. It comes with a YouTube ap on the desktop. YouTube videos look very good and play cleanly. I have to give a thumbs up on the video processor/display for this price point. I loaded about 100 albums onto the device via the tflash(micro SD) port. This was a memory card I use in my SanDisk Sansa. The card was originally load via Microsoft Media Player. The music imported without any need of conversion, seamless. Audio quality is excellent. It has a mono speaker built in and a stereo mini phono output jack for the headsets provided with the device. They too sound great. The only real let down on this device was it did not come withAndroid Market. It has GetJar. This is where you get your aps and widgets on line. I am not impressed with the GetJar service. This was repeated almost universally with all the reviews I read. There is an easy fix to this. You can find out how to do this on YouTube. Just search Kyros 7012 Android Market. Even a lay person can load the patch to put Android Market on this device. Then you have all the Android aps at your finger tips.  One nice function is it comes with a adapter cable for standard flash drives up to 4G of memory. No it doesn't have all the bells and whistles. No HDMI port, bluetooth, or built in camera. At this price you can't expect that. But if you want a basic tablet to surf, view photos and videos, YouTube, music,e-read, and play Angry Bird. Without blowing the budget. This device is for you. I also highly recommend this as a first tablet for the kids. Over all This is an excellent entry level tablet. I would have gave it 5 stars. If it had Android Market preloaded.",

But this is just not cutting it. <br /> <br />First of all, it's really not wireless, which you already know if you read the installation info on the Amazon page.  You have to plug it into the wireless server, and then you have to plug the server into a power outlet.  Not the most ideal set up, but I really needed it, so I figured I'd try it anyway.   <br /> <br />Problem #1, the camera is so light, it won't even stand up by itself.  The cord keeps pulling it over.   <br /> <br />Problem #2, it's supposed to be easy to install, and apparently everyone on here thinks it is, but it was giving me fits.  I got as far as it telling me to unplug the temporary network cable, and then it asked if I wanted to set it up for the internet, and I said yes, and everything was downhill from there.  It wouldn't find the camera at all without the network cable plugged in, and even when I had it plugged in, it would find the camera, but kept timing out trying to connect to it.  And the couple times I did get the connection, it would drop almost immediately. <br /> <br />I finally \\\\\"deleted\\\\\" the camera, and ran the wizard again to install it, and said NO to the set up for web question, and then it worked. <br /> <br />However, problem #3, it can't see outside at all.  I tried pointing it out the window and it was completely washed out, you could see a very faded tree and that was it.  I thought maybe it was a reflection problem with the window, so I opened the window, and same thing.  I have read about cameras not being able to see in the dark, but this one can't see when it's too bright, apparently.   <br /> <br />The other complaint that I have is that they tout this wireless bundle as a security thing... monitor your house from the internet, etc.  But then the camera they bundle it with is a regular webcam, not a wide angle.  If you're going to tryto monitor a room, then you need wide angle.  All it is is a USB webcam and a wireless server, it should have been easy for them to just put the Live Ultra (I think that's the wide angle one) in there instead of the Live.  Or maybe sell the server separate so you can buy whatever webcam you want. <br /> <br />Oh, and my other gripe is that the phone tech support is only open M-F during normal business hours, so if you need help setting it up, you have to call from work.  In which case, you won't have access to any of the equipment while you call, so they can't walk you through problems. <br /> <br />Annnd, one more thing... I was wishing that the software it came with had the same features as the Web Cam Center software (only for multiple cameras.)  I like the feature that records a photo every 10 seconds and stores them on the hard drive... that way I can just put it in thumbnail view and browse through until I see something in the frame that's not supposed to be there.  With the software that this comes with, it will take a photo every how-ever-many seconds, but then it puts it together in a movie, so unless you know what time something happened, you'd have to watch the whole movie in order to see anything. <br />",

The touchscreen makes turning pages much less annoying than having to click a button... and hear that soft \\\\\"click\\\\\" every minute or so. Plus, it kinda replicates turning the pages of a real book. You can also set the paper color (I turned mine to a soft yellow instead of bright white) and can choose the font and size.   AND THEN - the tablet features. I can shop, surf, play games, watch movies - all on a big screen. My favorite part has been the Netflix streaming. I use the same account I have at home, and can stream movies and tv anywhere I can get wi-fi.  SO - it does NOT have 3G and works just like a computer in the sense that you have to connect to a wifi connection. However, those seem to be everywhere.  The only feature I probably won't use is the music and Cloud storage. My music library far exceeds the alloted storage. And I have an ipod, so I doubt I'll bother with that. I did however load (directly from my computer using the the USB)pictuers and a couple home movies to take with me on a trip to show to family.  The minimal CONS: It is a little heavy, and holding it one handed get tiresome. I often use both hands or prop it on a pillow. It needs to be charged each night if you use it a lot (battery lasts about 8 hours on a bright screen - be sure to turn off WI FI). You do have to convert your movies to a readable format, but my mac does that just fine and the transfer is simple after that.   The other caution I have is if someone is truly lusting after an IPAD, this isn't a replacement. It doesn't have a camera and some of the other apple-y stuff. So if someone on your wishlist has their heart set on an ipad, don't order this. However, if they don't really care about brand and just want a super awesome reader and tablet... this is the one... and the price is right.",

It gives that extra sturdiness that the Surface Pro lacks when resting on your lap or non flat surfaces. The pen holder is awesome. Way better than the stock holder. It always annoyed me that you can't fold the keyboard completely back when not using the keyboard while in tablet mode, but with this case when the unit is opened up and folded back in tablet mode and your walking around with it cradled in your arm like an ipad, the folio cover folded back creates a nice protective pocket to carry the keyboard around in while your not using the keyboard but still allows you to keep it all bundled up together and protected.<br /><br />Coolest Pros:<br />* Sturdiness while using in bed or traveling on non-flat surfaces<br />* Ability to keep keyboard tucked in the folio case when using as a tablet when not using keyboard<br />* Pen holder<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Well there's a little con, the surface keyboard does like to be completely flat. When the folio case is opened in tent mode and the keyboard is connected there's a little ridge whose edge depends on the angle you've set your display and creates a little uneven surface for the keyboard to operate. I've read others really slamming it for this, but its not a big deal. It's a few millimeters and not enough to affect performance. It's better then the alternative of using the Surface without a folio case.<br /><br />All in all very happy and highly recommend. Great product.",

You clearly want a small and sleek build, and this is the case to get.  I'll go over the good and bad and so so of this case.    The good of this is why you want it, right?  Well, this thing is TINY.  I clearly knew the dimensions by reading and compared to things I'd built before, but it's small.  It's as wide as many other computer cases, because it has to hold a real GPU, but the depth and height is amazing.  It includes a PSU that has all you need and is very efficient.  So, the price EVGA asks for isn't TOO out of the realm.  Both the case and PSU purchased separately might be cheaper from other vendors, but it isn't too out of the realm.  The PSU cables are sleeved which is nice and makes it easier to route the cables.  My PSU, unlike others, is very quiet running.  At load on stress tests that heat it up it stays pretty quiet and at idle, silent for all intents and purposes.  I do hear how loud it can get at startup, and if yours runs that way all the time, I'd say return it.    Everything will fit in this case, provided you plan as so many say.  I put my motherboard inside a few times and checked if I could put X cable in while it was installed or if I should do it before I installed it.  That made it MUCH easier to build.  I have huge hands and it's tight to build in the case, but if you plan and use patience, it goes just fine.  Space would be much better and cable routing if it wasn't for the infernal HDD cage.  That's one of the HUGE cons of this case that I'll get to later.  Space wise any GPU should fit within the Geforce series and many Radeon cards might fit if you do your homework.    This case looks awesome as the pictures shows.  That's the main thing that drew me to this case, just a simple design and it's small, which adds a lot to the looks.  The materials are very nice and it's a pretty sturdy case given the size.  I don't get why a few people are upset that some grey parts of the metal show - very few areas are like this and it's always going to be covered by a side panel.    The included fans - seem good, but I'll be honest they were the first thing to go.  I put in my old PWM Corsair SP120 fans because they move a ton of air if needed and they are very quiet when at very low RPMs.  These are very easy to replace and are just like any other case.  The cooler I'm using is the 92mm Noctua tower cooler - my favorite SFF cooler there is that I've used.  It keeps my CPU cool, but Haswell is toasty.  The case and component temps are fine, I live in hot Arizona and in the summer now, it's maybe 5-10c above my old mATX rig that had 5 fans well placed vs. the 2 in this rig.  So, not bad overall.    The bad things about this case and honestly, they pain me, but I must only give it 4 stars for this.  They are major.  The first is the DVD options - it says slimline, but only their one provided by EVGA works with the button and the sled they give you well.  This is seriously a drawback as many slim DVD drives could work here.  Installing it was fine, so at least that was a bonus.  The next, is the entire HDD and DVD drive cage.  This, at the very least, should be easily removed.  It would make building much easier.  I would go a step further saying that it should only fit 2.5'' drives - still leaves room for cheaper laptop type HDDs for bigger storage if you need more than SSDs offer.  Also, many mobos have m2 slots or msata so you can put a drive there too for more storage.  It also has some tabs on the HDD cage that can help with cable routing, but they also hinder it too.  Very, very poor design.  Those are the 2 major design flaws.  The less major one that I could fix by modding, is the fact the back of this has holes from the Hydro version that aren't very useful.  It also has some metal tabs in the area that look like it could mount up an SSD (more reasons to nix that cage).EVGA could have easily made this an optional fan mount for an 80mm (I checked by holding one up there).  It would also hold a 92mm fan, but that would be very tight.  This would have helped airflow greatly, by allowing you to actively force some cool air into the case.  Get a drill or other type tool and make some mounting holes and airflow holes and you have your own fan vent.    Overall, the 2 major oversights shouldn't let you not buy this case.  You have this, the inwin 901, and a couple others in this form factor that look good and work well.  So, do yourself a solid, and buy this.",

The stand is probably the best I've seen on a monitor since the days of the old CRT monitors (which were an entirely different animal, of course).

I have much nicer exterior speakers already set up, so that's not a big problem for me.<br /><br />2) And with the monitor pivoted to &#34;portrait&#34; orientation, the top of the monitor is so high that it would be nice if the stand permitted the screen to actually be tilted down a little more.  I'm fairly tall, but I found that I have to look up to read the top of the screen. You could just raise your seat, if that did not make your work surface too low for you.  The stand, apparently, has to have some height to it in order to be able to accomodate the pivot feature.",

This case allows free use of and access to the kickstand.  However, there are some minor cons.  1.  The kickstand cover has too weak of a magnet so it flaps around. 2. It does not allow for type cover to be angled...i miss using the angle.  3.  It's pretty thick. 4.  It does not keep the screen of the surface protected as well as it could.  There is no way to close the type cover to this cover, so it also flops around.  A magnet, velcro or clip would be nice.  Otherwise it suits my purpose.",

However, what it does not say is that when you have 3 monitors attached to it they will all be in one continuous straight line and/or the center monitor will stick out at least 2&#34; - 3&#34; above the side monitors. Who the heck wants a three monitor setup  where all monitors will be side by side STRAIGHT. Don't you want the side monitors nicely lined up with the center monitor and angled slightly inwards? I know I do and that is how I expected a product such as this to be. I was disgusted when I realized what this item REALLY is and how different it is from the description and pictures. Oh, the center base is also A LOT bigger than how it looks in the photo graph and you WILL need to also bolt the thing down to your desk to prevent it from tipping over. The weight of the monitors on the sides will cause this thing to tip forward like you wouldn't believe.<br /><br />If you are interested in a device (like this) that will let you setup a three monitor setup and have the side monitors flush with the center monitor and angled inwards then this is NOT the item you are looking for. I was extremely disgusted by this purchase and REALLY hope Amazon will give me my money back when I return it. This thing isn't even worth twenty dollars- it's that awful!",

Although it's not shaped for a camera, my Niko D90 with a long lense fits in it perfectly with room on the top or bottom (I usually face the lense downward).  The camera slips in and out easily and I don't 'look' like I'm carrying a camera and therefore look less like a target for thieves.

The case fits my Nexus 7 pretty well, and the magnetic lid mostly works OK at putting the Nexus to sleep and waking it up when closed and opened respectively. The case is a bit bulky, but I suppose it is offering some protection. Some function keys are a bit more troublesome to get at because of the thickness of the screen cover, but that is manageable. My biggest gripe about this product and the company that sells it is that they persist in describing it as PU leather. PU stands for polyurethane, which is not leather at all, but plastic. So the word leather is totally misleading, and probably in violation of advertising regulations. This would better be called \\\\\"polyurethane with the look and feel of leather,\\\\\" which is the way the lawyers would make us state it back in the day when I worked in advertising. Bottom line -- decent case for the money. But completely false advertising to call this leather. It's not.    UPDATE: After using this case for a few weeks, I am downgrading my review from three stars to two, primarily because the thickness and design of the case makes it very difficult or impossible in some cases to click hot buttons in the corners of the screen. So I now only use the case when traveling, which is not that often. For the price, I would still say it is a decent case, but for the most part, I have stopped using it in order to avoid having to periodically remove it from its case to click on a link. Too much of a pain. The support staff is very helpful and very eager to make things right. Since I still use the case for traveling, I declined their kind offer of a refund.  But overall, I would hope you could do better in finding a suitable case, albeit probably a more expensive one.",

The TS-451 is billed as a media server solution, which is exactly what I purchased it to do.  I have a large media library consisting of HD video and lossless music content and the TS-451 was meant to be a single location to store and serve up these files, locally and remotely, via the pre-installed Plex Media Server and a couple of the native Qnap apps.  It serves files ok on my LAN, although a bit choppy, but the Celeron processor is not powerful enough to transcode and serve HD files remotely.  It chokes and stutters constantly and is unwatchable.  I have ample upload bandwidth available and upgrading to 8GB of RAM (as I did) does nothing to aid in transcoding, as this is a processor intensive task.<br /><br />This NAS will probably work fine strictly as a LAN storage solution, but I cannot recommend it at all as an HD media server for remote access and Qnap shouldn't be advertising it as such, not with such a low-end processor.",

Firstly, the mouse itself is solidly-built; it feels like it should be able to handle getting slightly banged around in my computer case while on the move. I was initially not sure if the ability to add/remove/shift the included weights would improve my experience, however the &#34;handling characteristics&#34; were markedly improved as I experimented with the weight configurations. The laser sensor works well on all but the glossiest surfaces, and the size fits my palm comfortably.<br /><br />However, the few complaints I do have:<br />- (Biggest complaint) The woven shroud over the cord does not move/stretch/slide/twist freely over the cord itself and will very quickly start binding the cord inside, creating corners and twists along the length that causing it to catch on itself and the edge of the desk or table. This is extremely annoying and was only remedied by actually cutting the woven shroud off the cord. Bad design, I guess.<br />-The non-slip grip on the sides of the mouse, notibly the area the thumb rests, while plenty grippy enough to prevent slippage, feels almost grimy, and you'll find yourself trying to brush off invisible dirt the first few times you use it.<br />-The right click is almost too sensitive, and if your hand gets the least bit lazy you'll start inadvertantly right-clicking.<br /><br />All-in-all, besides the issues with the cord, I'd more than likely purchase this mouse again.",

Some of the letters are coming off and the bottom left row of letters and the space bar work when they feel like it.  I have given this keyboard a lot of use and even dropped it from my lap onto a hard floor once early on.  I've been quite happy with it, but now I think it is time to order a new one.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br />I can't remember when I bought this, but I know I have had it for at least a few years. The letter e has worn off but that's not a big deal for me.  Other than that I love this keyboard. I increased it to five stars because it has been a super product.  I dropped it on a hard floor soon after I got it and panicked, but no fear.  It has worked fine in spite of the drop.  So it is very durable.  I thought about looking for a foldable keyboard, but after looking at the keyboard arrangements for them decided to be content with this one.  I love that the shift keys are big and there is nothing funky about this keyboard that I had to get used too and after typing on it I don't have to get used to my laptop keyboard.  I would highly recommend this little jewel to anyone looking for an IOS keyboard.  It is well worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />I just got this in the mail today and have been playing around with it.  Right out of the box, here are my first impressions:<br />Positives:<br />Size and weight are just right for taking along.<br /><br />It connected with no problems<br /><br />I can shut it off and come back and turn it on and it will connect without having to reenter any codes.<br /><br />The buttons are large enough that I have no trouble typing on it<br /><br />I was happily supprised that it came with a stand for my ipod<br /><br />Negatives:<br />The space bar doesn't always respond. I think this is due to the fact that it takes more pressure than I am used to to get a response from it.<br /><br />The instruction booklet is lacking on instructions. It tells you how to connect and has a diagram for what the F buttons across the top do but other than that there are no instructions.<br /><br />I remember the online description saying there is a one year warranty with this, but there is nothing in the box that indicates this and nothing to send in to register it.<br /><br />If it keeps working like it is so far, I think I will be quite happy with this product.  It is what I am using right now to type this review.  I would give it 5 stars but for the issue with the space bar not always responding. I will update this review after I have used this poduct for several months.  I hope that I can keep it at 4 stars or even upgrade it to 5.<br />The instruction booklet is lacking on instructions.

It's free so whatever.<br /><br />Now, one thing I experienced with this keyboard when taking it out of the box was that it would not lay flat on my keyboard tray. I had to twist the entire keyboard holding both ends to undo the warping of the plastic as best as I could. I was frankly pissed and I'm lucky I didn't break it when doing this.<br /><br />I could have contacted Amazon to get a replacement but I didn't want to go through the hassle of shipping it back and waiting for them to send another one as I needed a keyboard at the time. I really should have demanded my money back for receiving it damaged.<br /><br />If you order this hopefully you'll receive a keyboard without any issues. It's cheap, a basic model keyboard and if that's what you want that is exactly what you'll get. The only LED icons on the keyboard are for Number Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock when activated. The keyboard is as black as Microsoft's soul. I would have preferred one in silver myself...",

Initially I bought the 10.1-11.6 Inch Netbook Sleeve and it fit my chromebook perfectly. I was perfectly happy with the sleeve so when I got my Macbook Pro Retina I decided I would get the same case in the bigger size. Also when I searched the Macbook Pro Retina on Amazon, the case logic sleeve was the relevant item. The ratings were nearly five stars, just the same as when I got the 11.6 inch sleeve, so I figured it would be another perfect fit. Then when I put my 13.3 inch Macbook Pro Retina into the sleeve that I bought which was supposed to be for \\\\\"13.3 Inch Laptop / MacBook Air / MacBook Pro Retina Display\\\\\" it was about 1\\\\\" too deep, 1/2\\\\\" too thick, and 1/2\\\\\" too wide so my Macbook was floating around in it. Then I read the reviews and others had the same problem.<br /><br />THIS CASE IS FOR 13.3-14 INCH LAPTOPS AND DOES NOT FIT THE MACBOOK PRO SNUG<br /><br />So I went to the Apple store and found a C\u00f4te&Ciel zippered sleeve that fits perfectly. The C\u00f4te&Ciel 13\\\\\" MacBook Pro Retina Display was exactly what I was looking for. I'm not sure if they are offered at every Apple store because when I browsed online I didn't see it there.

At this price point, this is simply not on.  Secondly, I've had two units in 12 months which have stopped responding to the charger - again, rendering them useless (i.e. no charge).

The iPad is protected really well but it is not as heavy as some other cases like the Otterbox which she never liked because of the bulk and weight. This is also more secure to hold because of the leather strap, really impressed with that.<br /><br />The stand is also great, smooth operation and very sturdy, the best stand I have for all the 7 tablets I own or have owned. The Airbender stand is great as well but different because of the keyboard, as a standalone case the Gladius stand is the best.<br /><br />I really wish New Trent made cases for Samsung tablets as well, I would replace the cases I have with there's since that is how impressed I am with there quality and price.<br /><br />I have probably owned over a dozen cases for tablets over the years and this one is the best, even better than the Otterbox Defender which is just too bulky.

That's kind of a joke since I'm really a snob about it, but at the same time I have so much experience with every kind of cable made that I think I have a very good base to report on this topic.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The jacket (plastic covering) is nice and thick. Should be good shielding for the wires inside and helps make the cable stiffer and less likely to crimp.<br />-It appears to be a real CAT6 cable. I didn't do the actual tests to verify this, but the shielding looks correct and the network devices show up as 1GB and the speeds look appropriate (best I can do without actually plugging it into an analyzer, which is too much effort for a cable at home).<br />-It appears to be the right length, although again I didn't actually measure it against a tape measure.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The clips/covers are not my favorite design (although not the worst out there either). That's the little plastic thing you press down to release the cable and the plastic covering over that piece. Personally I prefer the type of covering that is somewhat flexible and covers the entire clip, and slides down the cable. It provides the best coverage, but is still easy to unclip when you need to. The clip my cable has is like the first picture that is currently on the product page. It just has a small piece of plastic that barely touches the clip. That style is fine for a cable that is always plugged in, but when moving the cable, it's actually kind of easy for it to snag on a thinner wire like a phone power cord or something. I'm guessing by the various pictures for the product that this company gets different varieties in depending on what they can buy the cheapest, so you may get a completely different style.<br /><br />Notes:<br />-The color on the cable I received was the darker blue that's very common nowadays, not the lighter blue that is shown as a customer image.tomer image.",

Battlefield 3 on PS3(HDMI) is beautiful with no tearing and Minecraft on PC(DVI) with various shader packs is also beautiful.<br /><br />I am planning on getting another monitor and might get this one again, but I also am considering an upgrade to a larger size. Once the money starts flowing Ill think harder on the issue. For now, I am happy with this monitor.<br /><br />*Forgot to mention- I recently learned the hard way that I was underpowering my PC and this could be the cause of the tearing. RMA-ed the MOBO and will hopefully see a difference in performance with a large PSU.

Nothing from my ps3 would work and I tried multiple speakers and inputs(HDMI, DVI, VGA). I RMA-ed the monitor to ASUS and the process is was fairly easy. It took about a month to get my monitor back after shipping it to them(which they paid for!) But what I am most surprised by was the return packaging. They had my fixed monitor in a bubble-case that completely, im serious- completely, enclosed it. And that was within the outerbox. It was the best return packaging I had ever seen and for this reasonalone I will be doing business with ASUS again.

I was able to setup 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz wifi hotspots for different devices, such that no one bandwidth was overwhelmed. Port forwarding of my ip cameras was a snap, so was the setting of parental controls. Note, all of was this was done after I upgraded to the newest stable firmware. Initially, I was able to enjoy better wireless signal strength and speed. This lasted for about two months, after which I started having problems with wifi internet connectivity. I contacted my ISP (DSL) and was told that there were no problems on their side. With a huge sigh, I reset the router to factory settings and then went through the process of tweaking the settings. The router continued to work well until earlier this week, when internet connectivity became a problem once more. I again contacted the ISP, we disconnected the router from the DSL modem and made a direct connection to a desktop. No problems were discovered with the supply. I then decided to run an experiment by purchasing a cheap linksys E900. The short version is that we now have wireless connectivity with the cheap router. Of course the speed is much slower, and I'm left with a fancy door stop. In conclusion, does the product live up to the hype? hell yes!! briefly.",

It is considerably larger than other pads which is nice for me since i play PC games that require a lot of mouse moving. also it has a lower profile, its height is about 2 mm which is low enough for me to lay my hand/wrist across the edge comfrotably. It sticks to my face wood surface desk very well. It will not move unless i delibrately grab it and pull it. I prefer its looks also. It has a nice professional look to it. I am not a fan of the gimmicky themes like world of warcraft or COD. The pad is smooth but not slippery like some plasic/metal mouse pads. I feel I have a full control over the mouse movements. -----<br />Overall this is a good quality mouse pad but its nothing premium or special. if you have a crappy low quality mouse pad or your pad is just not the preffered size than i would reccommend this. If you are satisfied with your current mouse pad this will not be a real improvement.",

It has a nice Blood red color to it and looks great in your build but one of the things I didn't really like about this tubing is when I put LED lighting's in my case the tubing would appear transparent and that did not look really well with the build.

So on AC's advice, I took the iMac to the Apple store. With Bad scroll wheel, bad 320 GB HD, and, I also mentioned the vertical streaks, in the lcd screen..... I thought I'd get laughed at.    Not so quick.  I went in, and talked it all over, I'm not as stupid as I sound, and knew what I needed to do, To Save My Data!! (LOTS of Legal stuff!)~~OK?    I bought this Western Digital 2  TB USB/FIREWIRE Studio Book. They put my iMac on the Genius Bar, connected it to the 800FW and the Studio Book. It took a few hours, to do a suddenly Brand New, Time Machine Backup.   BUT> DID IT? IT DID! WHEW~~~~!!!!!!!!!!!! Happy Me! Saved ALL my Data! Thank you Lord!  They handed my my new WD Book Studio (My Data), they don't wanna be responsible for it, and I don't blame 'em! Said, come back tomorry. They called me.  Here's what they did:    New HD, UP from a 320 GB, to a 500GB, loaded with Snow Leopard, AND/PLUS/INCLUDING/ALSO, all new iLife 09! I thought that's GREAT! And, it IS!  Then, since I did bitch a bit about the screen having the vertical stripes, they replaced THe LCD, and the GLASS! BEAUTIFUL!  I couldn't be happier, but, they also gave me another new Mighty Mouse!!   YEA!!!!!  Total Cost to AppleCare..... $989.00, like that...  Total cost to me?  ZERO $.  I bought the WEstern Digital Book 2 TB, for about 289, like that, not the cheapest, but, I got to save ALL my data. They loaded it back onto my internal HD, which is now much bigger, and has Snow Leopard, rather than just leopard on it.    This was All done at Cherry Hill mall Store, in Cherry Hill, NJ!    I couldn't be happier with Apple's service, and their recommendation of the WD MyBook  2 TB USB/4/800 Firewire external HD!    I'm still a Happy Apple Camper...

I just transferred 1GB of *large* video files (HD game trailers) to the stick.  Total time: 24 minutes.  24 minutes for 1GB of large files.  That works out to a beyond pathetic 700KB/second!  What on earth is wrong with this POS?    Transferring small files is even worse... I have spent an entire afternoon filling this stick with a few thousand files.  Don't EVER copy a lot of small files to this, zip them up or something first to a single file.    Delete performance is just as bad.  I have seen it take an entire minute to delete a couple of large files.  When I had to delete thousands of files, I literally gave up because it was taking forever (looked like it was going to take hours), and formatted the thing.    It's like this thing's FAT (File Allocation Table) is horribly slow, and any changes to it take an unreasonably long time.    Oh, as if the above wasn't bad enough, several times I have copied a huge file to this, and then found out later the file wasn't copied properly.  I was able to scan one of the non-working files using BitTorrent's hash checking (against a torrent of the same file), and guess what?  The first 1% of the (2.4 GB) file was corrupted or missing, which means ~24MB didn't get copied properly.  Brilliant.    The *only* bright point with this stick is it truly does have amazing read speeds... approaching 30MB/sec.  But the ridiculously poor write performance makes this thing basically unusable for me in real-world use.  Perhaps if you write to this extremely infrequently and read all the time from it, it would be adequate.

However, once I installed the new drive into the laptop, it would work fine for a period of several hours to several days, but then fail to boot.  As I discovered later, defragmenting the new drive would cause it to fail to boot immediately.  I repeated the cloning process at least a dozen times with both default and various custom settings in EZ GIg III, with the same results.  This wasted about a week's worth of my free time, since I had to go back to using my old drive and restore files from backup every time the laptop would fail to boot with the new drive.  I contacted Apricorn technical support, and they suggested that I set the size of the new drive to something below 100GB, which in my opinion would defeat the purpose of the exercise.  I am aware of the 137GB drive size limit in older laptops, but I think that telling customers to set it below 100GB is unreasonable.  I was finally able to successfully clone the drive using the free Acronis True Image software available from Western Digital.  Caveat emptor!",

One feature that is not highlighted by UE is the removeable D-ring.  you can mount the Boom on a gorilla pod or standard tripod.  Great for placing it on a patio table.  The quality of this speaker is superb, pairing is simple and there is a 3.5mm aux in if you of not want to use bluetooth.<br /><br />Update: 7/3/13 - The first UE Boom I purchased was so good, that I bought a second one (a R/W and a Black one) - I am using with an iPhone 5 and pairing could not be easier with the UE Boom App, stereo separation is noticeable and I have not experienced any stuttering with the audio, the sound coming out of the paired speakers is incredible - loud, clear and decent fidelity.  I have used the RDIO app to pump content into the speakers - 5+ stars so far!  I the only quible I have with the iPhone App, when 2 speakers are linked to your iPhone, you can view the battery level on the second speaker only.  Hopefully a future upgrade will give the option to view settings for both attached speakers.<br /><br />To Double speakers:<br />1.  Pair each with the iPhone. (BT)<br />2.  Launch the UE Boom application, the application will recognize that 2 speakers are connected.<br />3.  Go to the Double up menu (note, I have 2 different colored Booms, and the color representation is accurate in the graphics of the application, this is very Apple like - cool!)<br />4.  In the Double up screen you can select to pump stereo thru the speakers or \\\\\"double\\\\\" - where you are sending the same mono signal to each speaker.

RCA, S-video, and even true RGB make this perfect for virtually all 16-bit consoles forward. Though I would've appreciated an F-type coaxial input (ATARI 2600, Intellivision, etc.) to make this truly perfect, it makes a very good case for itself managing so many others, having a new English firmware update, and other features like scan lines. SNES/PCE/Genesis and various 16-bit sprite-heavy games (even certain 2D Sega Saturn games) are a joy to see in hi-res and play, with settings to minimize input lag. Other systems need some fiddling around with the settings, but once you find settings you're happy with, you'll realize that it's not too bad at all. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a TV or any other device that offers this much flexibility at this price, and all in such a small box.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but if you can afford it and take your gaming hobby seriously, it's worth every penny.

            "input": "Based on some of the uninformed, ignorant _OPINIONS_  in the 1 star reviews for this product, I am driven to provide my review of the Cooler Master Jetflo 120 and supply some _FACTS_.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I own the Jetflos,  I also own and use:  Antec 120MMs (tricools and adjustable), Arctic Cooling F12 PWM, Cooler Master Blademaster 120, Enermax Magma's, Noctua  NF-F12 PWM, Noiseblocker NB-SilentPro, and Scythe Kaze Maru 140MM PWM,  also Corsair 200mm (700 rpm), Antec 200mm fans.  I have also tried Silenx iXtrema's and Coolermaster Sickleflow 120 fans.<br /><br />Out of the box/full speed the Jetflo 120MMs are 2100 rpm fans that also move a large amount of air. _ANY_ fan running at 2100 rpm is going to be loud.  Any fan that moves the amount of air this fan does at 2100 rpm is going to be loud.  (According to some websites, the Highest CFM ever seen at 2100 RPM).<br /><br />Look at any fan claiming to be very quiet,  all these fans are running at 1200 RPM (or lower).  If you run this fan at 1200 RPM it will be quiet<br /><br />I see some reviewers that say the Jetflo is not as quiet as a (for example) Noctua. While this is basically true when running both fans at full RPM, it ignores important facts.  The Noctua runs a max RPM around 1400 with a CFM of 55, the Jetflo: 2100 RPM and 95 CFM.  So the Jetflo has 50% more RPM and 73% more CFM (More CFM is good) at max voltage.  Yes, common sense would say the Jetflo at 2100 rpm is going to be much louder than a Noctua at 1400 rpm. But this is comparing apples to oranges.<br /><br />If you compare apples to apples (both fans at the same RPM) you will have a different experience.  In other words:  WHEN RUNNING AT THE SAME RPM the jetflo fans are as quiet as any antec/noctua/nexus etc. fan.<br /><br />So lets compare(in detail) apples to apples. The Noctua and Jetflo at 1400 RPM:  Noctua NF-F12 PWM: 55 CFM @ 27.5 dBA vs Jetflo: 58 CFM @25 dBA.  (As independently verified by using observed values (not the values printed on the fan packaging)from websites like Anandtech, Silent PC review, Xbit labs, etc )<br /><br />The JETFLO is quieter (25 vs 27.5 dBA (lower is better) and moves more air (58 vs 55) than the Noctua.<br /><br />It's all about moving air and to move air you generally need rpm.  But setting that aside, try all these fans at 1200 rpm and then tell me the Jetflo is LOUD.<br /><br />What I have yet to hear is the Jetflo is louder than a Corsair SP120 High performance or louder than a Scythe Slipstream Slipstream (Model SY1225SL12SH -1900 rpm) fan or louder than a Scythe Gentle Typhoon at 3000 RPM.<br /><br />Compare apples to apples, people<br /><br />Most recent motherboards are equipped with HW/Bios SW to control fan speeds. (If not you can use free ware like Speed fan to control them by SW).  It was very easy to set up my MBs so the fan doesn't reach 1600 rpm until 50C(which it should never do unless the CPU cooler has failed or is filled with dust). Then the noisy fan serves two purposes: 1) As a warning that something is wrong. 2) Assists the struggling  CPU cooler by moving lots of air thru the case.<br /><br />To quiet my systems (a HTPC, gaming PC and work PC) and improve airflow, I am in the process of swapping out some Antecs, Scythe Slipstream 120MMs (1450 RPM),  and Enermax Magmas.  In side by side comparison, at the same RPM levels (tested at 800, 1200, 1400 and 1600 RPM) I have found the Jetflo's quieter and move more air than any antec (I own), Coolermaster Sickleflow, Enermax or Scythe Slipstream fans.<br /><br />I have two of these CM jetflo fans as intakes and an Noctua NF-F12 on the side and an Arctic Cooling on rear of an Antec 300 case.  When all fans are at 1200 rpm, the CMs are no louder than the Noctua or AC.  At 1400 the Noctua is not quieter.  When the Jetflo exceed 1600 RPM, their noise is competing with noise from the CPU and GPU fans.  But at high temps, any (properly functioning) system (using air cooling) should be loud or you are going to have components running at 80-90c.  (btw, the HTPC system temperature typically runs from 27-33c, the 50c+ temperatures are individual components(each with it's own heatsink/fan).  In other words system airflow is EXCELLENT)<br /><br />As mentioned above my HTPC uses Jetflo's, at normal operating temperatures the system is silent (I have to look at the power LED to see if system is running).  When stress testing there is fan noise but not enough to make me adjust the sound on my HDTV.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/29:  I've read some comments that lead me to believe the Jetflo may have a problem with the PWM controllers on some motherboards.  (as the comment-er has not supplied details, I'm not sure which PWM controller).  Either that or it could be another bad fan (which makes me wonder about quality control).  Either way not a good thing",

But there are downloadable drivers for it for both the 32- and 64-bit versions[...].  I installed it on 32-bit Vista Enterprise without any problems.    Highly recommended if you have wireless 360 controllers and a need for a PC gamepad.",

I got this as a gift for my parents for this exact reason (and though their new camera was using an xD card, so this didn't fit) I tried it out in my own two cameras as well. In my small Canon PowerShot SD600 camera transfers from the camera to my computer and my chosen photo service were speedy and seamless. In my big-boy Nikon D80 camera transfers were a little slow (since the pictures are taken in such a large resolution and are rather big) but still worked seamlessly.    I don't think I would use the card in my D80, only because I generally use it to take a lot of pictures and sync them as soon as I get home and want to review them right away. However; in the smaller camera that takes smaller pictures, it was nice to be able to take random pictures and come home and turn the camera on for a few minutes and let it do all the work.    To sum up my review, here's some pros and cons:    Pros: Decent transfer speed for smaller pictures taken with your typical smaller cameras. Seamless integration with the Mac (OSX Leopard) and PC (Windows XP). Compatible with many popular online photo sites; you are likely to already be using one of them.    Cons: The transfer speed is just a bit slow for larger pictures taken by more professional cameras. It's still only SD, so there's some camera incompatibility still. The price is more than I'd like to see still, but it's a new product fresh on the market that nothing else can touch yet.",

Obviously the RAM upgrade itself made a difference, but even with more computer RAM the Nvidia card didn't perform that much better. Once I installed the Radeon 4650 I saw an immediate difference, no lagging while watching DVD's. And with the Radeon having it's own 1GB RAM it really freed up the rest of my computer so that I could keep other large programs open in the background without it slowing down my computer. I was a little weary about installing this in my almost 10 year old computer, as I read reviews where people had issues installing the drivers from other Radeon cards, but I had no problems with my install, I followed the directions by removing my Nvidia drivers, installed the card, put in the CD and the computer did the rest. Very easy install. So far this card works great. If you have an AGP video card slot and are looking to upgrade, this card is the way to go. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",

If you do not have USB 3.0 ports on a desktop [how to tell? 3.0 ports have a little sky-blue interior plastic guide; it's black on older ports], you can add a multiple port USB 3.0 card for $30-40 (check for available slots and type inside first), and run this drive up to its potential (which I do), otherwise, it will work on USB 2.0 ports, only more slowly.  Also, beware, SOME external USB hubs (eg, cheaper ones) do not provide enough power to run an external drive.  The included WD backup software keeps this 2TB drive working for me continuously (or, optionally, on an hourly, daily, or monthly choice) backing up my 1TB internal HD on my new Windows 8 desktop. Set up was easy - I selected what folders to ignore (such as C:\\temp and C:\\Downloads), and it did the rest. WD also provides a drive cloning app called Acronis True Image which I have not used. Neither software does incremental backup, but Smartdrive allows you to keep 20 or more former versions of a file to give historical recovery. I have not had to use the file recovery yet [UPDATE: just did; keep reading...] but it provides options to recover to original location, or to a 'Retrieved Content Folder' of your choice ... OK, I just DID THAT for a spreadsheet I worked on the past couple days.  It showed me multiple backup copies (different prior versions) as expected. I selected an older one, clicked Next, and it retrieved just that file to my designated Retrieved Contents Folder.  From within that folder, it reconstructed the original sub-directory path down to the restored file so I could navigate to it just as I would do with the original file, down from C:\\.  It worked reasonably quickly and the file opened in Excel flawlessly ... good to go.  Note: This is all with the free, included software (which I just upgraded on-line to their new free 2.0 version last week).  The Pro upgrade is (presently) $19.95 for up to three computers (I guess you could use this 2TB drive to backup multiple computers?)  The Pro version adds backup to non WD devices, and to a remote Dropbox folder - all features not of interest to me.

Picking up the assembled table from an adjacent flat surface (i.e. your floor) is kind of a challenge, as the table splits in the middle and has an adjustable flat surface to accommodate myriad angles of laptop viewing, and 2.) the usb cable that powers the fans is on a spool which is supposed to be retractable.

I have gotten used to very high resolution screens and this one just seems to low.  Secondly there is no solid state drive included.  This is really not much of a problem once the laptop has booted and started everything but it is noticeably slow the first few minutes.

Plug in your wireless receiver, and find it using Device Manager > Other Devices > Unknown Device.  That Unknown Device is your wireless receiver.  If for some reason you didn't follow step 1, you need to uninstall the drivers that came with the device.<br />4.  You want to select Update Drivers<br />5. \\\\\"Browse my computer for device software\\\\\" > \\\\\"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\\\\\"<br />6. Search for \\\\\"Xbox 360 Wireless *Receiver* for Windows\\\\\"  Make sure it is the most recent version!  There are multiple versions, make sure it is the most recent version!

It was apparently not getting enough charge to my laptop because as soon as it died, my laptop's battery began to drain way too quickly.<br /><br />With this charger, I haven't had any problems. I bought it around three months ago, and it has worked great so far. When I take my laptop off of the charger (which I do more frequently now), it lasts as long as it did with the original charger. I definitely recommend this with the HP Pavillion dv4 laptop (listed here, specifically: http://www.amazon.com/HP-Pavilion-customizable-Notebook-Processor/dp/B00393WKO4/ref=sr_1_33?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1329951171&sr=1-33).<br /><br />I would even buy one of these if you are getting a new laptop such as the one above. The original charger wore very quickly, and this charger is cheap enough, and it works just as well as the original. If I have any problems, I'll be sure to update my review.<br /><br />UPDATE for 7/2013: The charger ended up dying and I bought a \\\\\"real\\\\\" HP adapter that has lasted this long (it is now 7/2014) because it was the only thing I could find in the store. However, had I had a choice, I probably would have bought the cheap one again. For the price, it lasts quite a while and I don't have to pay $70 to replace it.",

We both have become avid note takers with the IPad and I use the Ayl stylus extensively for my sales job to take notes.  One of my favorite features is the side clip because I can clip the stylus on the edge leather of my Bear Motion leather case versus having the stylus in my pocket or hanging from the audio jack.  But then again most pens have a side clip.  Pen is easy to use and more responsive than any pen I could find in the Apple store.  One weird complaint...the soft rubber head makes a slight \\\\\"popping\\\\\" sound when writing.  Certinly not loud, but very noticeable to me when writing.  This is a result of the soft, hollow rubber head of the pen depressing when writing and popping back into shape when the pen is lifted of the iPad.  Seems to happen less the more vertical I hold the Pen.  When the wife and I are sitting together taking notes we have a little popping chorus.  FYI, I do not press abnormally hard and even when trying to write softly it makes the sound.  Functionally the pens are great yet that little popping sound does annoy me and if I found a pen that wrote as well without that little fluke I would buy it.  I figure this probably happens with any brand of soft rubber tip.",

This means that using it on a table in landscape mode is fine, but trying to turn the iPad around 180 degrees to view it upright doesn't work because the angle created by the hook on the case is such that the iPad is not supported and falls over backwards. So it can't sit up upright at all (neither in portrait mode, which the case isn't designed for, NOR in landscape mode which it's supposed to be designed for, which would be nice for displaying recipes on the counter while cooking, or trying to watch a TV show or movie).",

It's also non detachable so if you want to just fold the case back and only use the tablet, the weight of the keyboard does become cumbersome.<br /><br />The case comes with it's own micro USB charging cord that will plug into any cell phone charging unit.  Remember to charge the case first before attempting to pair it to your tablet or use it for the first time.  When charging, a blue light will initially turn on to indicate the unit is charging.  After a minute or so, the light will turn off.  The unit is still charging however.  When the battery on the keyboard is low, the light will turn on to notify that it needs to be charged.<br /><br />To keep the tablet upright, all you simply have to do is fold the cover back.  The same magnet that keeps the tablet closed also anchors the tablet to keep it upright when you're using it at a table.<br /><br />One complaint I have about the unit is that it doesn't come with any directions whatsoever.  All you get is a simple card with pairing instructions and a link if there are any issues.  For an $80 keyboard, a more detailed instruction card would have been nice.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with this unit was getting it to pair for the first time.  The unit finally paired up with my tablet after the third attempt.  Also know that if the charge on the keyboard goes out, you will need to pair up the keyboard again with your tablet.<br /><br />All in all though....it's a reliable unit.",

That is because it has the FCC sticker indicating TF201 and the firmware does the same.  That said, I tested my infinity on a 201 dock and it didn't work right, and on this dock it is working flawlessly.  In addition, the color matches, the weight distribution is good, and I'm having zero issues typing on it.  The battery life is phenomenal and the seating of the tablet has no issues worth noting.<br /><br />I am of course extremely disappointed that I could have ordered from any of the other sellers on here and gotten the same product weeks ago for less cash, but I got what I wanted and as of yet am very satisfied with it.  I do think it was pretty crappy of Asus to reformat and sell the 201 docks as 700 docks, but at least if it stops working, I'll have ground to stand on against Asus (not that I expect it to stop working).<br /><br />I can't recommend the dock enough.  If you bought a transformer you should buy the dock as well, it completely changes the experience of using an android tablet.  Just yesterday a coworker asked why I bought a netbook when I already had a tablet.  I asked him how many netbooks have a removable touch screen display and it was awe-inducing.  A great exprience overall.<br /><br />Very satisfied!<br /><br />UPDATE: Tested side by side with my Brother's Transformer Prime and I can confirm that the weight distribution/balancing is remarkably different from the Primes dock.  I am absolutely certain that this is a TF700 dock regardless of the firmware name.",

Where I would Have needed to spend hundreds on a laptop to do important work on the move, I just bought this device and combined it with a piece of kit I already owned. There is very little wrong with the device other tan the fact that as I gaze over the keys and functions of the key board I cannot see a pound sign. It is also rather hard to get the hard case to fit round the iPad 100% of the time, every now and then you find that you put the case back together and one or two of the latches wont click in without a considerable amount of force; bearing in mind there is a $500+ piece of kit within it it isn't somthing a lot of people are going to be comfortable with. That said It doesn't make a big difference. One or two latches don't affect the aesthetics or the protection quality of the case considering a thick silicon shell is there as an extra layer. The only other issue I have is that the instruction manual does not address the fact that the keyboard part is removable from the iPad section. Once I had figured that out I was over joyed. The device had suddenly become more free, the Case now lent itself to iPad gamers and rotational control, its a fantastic feature. Very nicely integrated and very user friendly, I just with I had been told. I put that down to a combination of my stupidity and a lack of direction, on reflection its rather simple, makes sense that the circular hold comes off however it is very well hidden, took me 3 days of use to figure that little Easter egg out.<br />In summary its a fantastic user friendly device with plenty of little features to make you feel that this is a device that took time and care to produce, its very wellexecuted.

            "input": "Where to start...<br /><br />I have used a few capture cards over the last year - Avermedia Live Gamer HD, Elgato Game Capture HD and HD60 - so I do have a bit of experience on the positives and negatives of each.<br /><br />The Live Gamer Extreme is a mixed bag, but I do like it for what I use it for - dual PC streaming.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1) It's small - nice and easy to unplug as needed and take it wherever.<br /><br />2) Very little latency overall - pretty rare to see with as small as this is and not being an internal card.<br /><br />3) Actually does 60 fps at 1080p as advertised.<br /><br />4) Picture looks great.<br /><br />5) Resolution options in the included software.  I use some old consoles and use RGB cables, then HDMI out to send to the LGE, at which time I switch the software to use 4:3 video (1280*1024 in most cases) - so the pictures don't look stretched out.  Works great.<br /><br />Several things I'm not a big fan of though.<br /><br />1) Limited options in the software.  While I do include the video options in the above positive notes, there's not a whole lot else.  Audio options are non-existent volume wise.  If what you're using  has relatively low volume, you'll need another program (in my case, Open Broadcasting Software - OBS) - to increase the volume of what you're playing.<br /><br />2)  The RECentral 2 takes a decent amount of resources to run, and Integration/usability with other software - like the above mentioned OBS, can be difficult, and take some CPU to run - likely because since this is not a PCIe card, it's more taxing on your CPU to run this than an internal card, like a Live Gamer HD.<br /><br />3)  It's an unadvertised nightlight.  The LGE, when left plugged in, has such a bright blue light that it lights up my room at night.  Which means I have two options.  Either I need to remember to cover the light up at night before I go to bed, or unplug the LGE from the USB port of my computer.  I turn my computer(s) off when I go to bed, and even with the computer OFF it still leaves the light on.  I could see that as OK my computers were in my living room, but since they're near me in my room, I don't have that option.  Having an off switch for that would be handy.<br /><br />4) Integration with other programs, like OBS:  While you can easily change some options while using OBS and not the RECentral 2, like brightness, while playing at anything under 1080p and using OBS for the LGE, it's difficult to play at anything under 1080p - the LGE just gives an 'out of range' message.  So if you're hoping to use the LGE and OBS without using RECentral 2, playing, say, an old game at 640*480, it is currently impossible without using RECentral 2.  You're forced to use the included software and just have OBS capture the RECentral 2 window.  That takes additional resources from your computer if it isn't very powerful.  Pretty unnecessary.<br /><br />5) Unlike most other streaming devices, there is no composite support for older game systems.  Even if they generally don't look good, it'd still be nice to have it.<br /><br />I have not tested the RECentral 2's ability to stream to places like Twitch etc, I can't see that as an option for myself.  The software takes enough resources by itself without trying to stream to a website, which is why I usually leave it up to a program designed for that, like OBS.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />  While there do seem to be more negatives than positives, I do like it overall.  The actual size of the LGE is nice and doesn't take a whole lot of room, but the unwanted night light is a bummer.  The software, while it works, needs more customization for me to care much about it - there are some video options, but audio is seriously lacking - even a simple volume button, so most of my options have to be configured through other programs.  Little to no latency means that in most cases, you probably can actually use the program to play a game on if you really needed to, but can get delayed the more things you have plugged into it.  For instance:  PS3 &#62; HDMI Splitter &#62; LGE is about a 1 - 1.25 second delay - so the HDMI out is a must in that case.  While using the LGE for dual PC streaming, however, it works with very little delay - maybe 1/10th of a second - I just hope you don't have to play a game under 1080p.<br /><br />  On a side note, it would be nice to see Avermedia get a working forum for reply purposes so you don't have to wait for 24-48 hours for an email if you're having an issue.  They've had the button at their US website, but I've never seen it work once.  They can usually get your issue(s) resolved through email, but it's a slow process.",

I then removed the screen from the sheet and sprayed it down on the contact side with the spray bottle provided.  I also gave a couple of sprays directly on the ipad's screen, and then placed the protector as per the instructions.  With the rubber wedge provided, I squeegeed the remaining fluids, and I wiped the excess with a microfiber towel.<br /><br />After completing the process, I couldn't wait and turned on my Ipad sooner than recommended.  As the product hadn't fully dried, there was a slight rainbow effect.  About an hour after use, the rainbow effect diminished and was completely gone a couple of hours thereafter.  At first there seemed to be some spray residue on the screen, but the next day all residue and rainbow effect were completely gone and it was crystal clear.<br /><br />I've now used this product for several days, and have noticed that it feels great.

            "input": "I am a System/Network Administrator with 39 years of IT experience, over 15 years of network experience, and almost two years of daily experience using the WAP4410N (version 1), and it is without a doubt the most unreliable wireless device I have ever used. My 2008 $49 Linksys WRT54GS router at home is far more reliable and never caused me a single access problem in almost three years of use.     Without any notice the WAP4410N loses contact with the LAN and will not pass traffic from it to the LAN, so the wireless device will make a wireless connection to the access point, but it will never receive an IP Address from the DHCP server.     The process is random and can happen anytime. All of the fixes that are offered over the years have only delayed the process. The loss of traffic flow can happen many times over a single day or even days on end.  Powering the device via AC Power or POE has no effect. Sometimes a reboot will fix the problem, sometimes a hard reboot (pull power) will fix the problem, sometimes nothing will fix the problem and I have to wait for the problem to disappear on its own.     What connects the WAP4410N to the LAN side has no effect, because I have had it connected to different devices (routers, switches), different brands (AdTran, Dell, and Cisco), different speeds (100Mbps, 1Gbps) and even a brand new Cisco 2960-S switch ratched down to 100Mbps/Full Duplex has had no effect.     I have installed every version of firmware that has been released, tried every configuration change (including using SSH to access the CLI and making changes to the configuration that way to bypass the web interface), and I have read every post including a massive two year old post on the Cisco Community forum with well over 1,800 entries all reporting the same problem.  Cisco released version 2 of the hardware last summer/fall with a crystal on the LAN port to fix a jitter problem with some 1Gbps switches, but the people who tried version 2 all reported that they had the same problem.   Even crazier the problem can go away for two or more weeks or even for up to four months and then one day it pops up again.   I highly recommend that you don't purchase this product, unless you want pain in your professional life.   As you can tell it happened again today, and this incident was the last straw. I will start a search for a reliable access point tomorrow. I will have to replace four (4) of these devices and even though the rest of our network uses Cisco for the core, it is very unlikely I will replace these access points with Cisco access points, at least not at this price point. If you decide to purchase the WAP4410N, my remark would be \\\\\"Caveat emptor\\\\\"  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE Wednesday, August 31, 2011:  I updated our four WAP4410N Access Points to the latest firmware version (2.0.4.2) last week as recommended by Diana from the Cisco Small Business Team and one of access points failed this afternoon in the same identical manner that they all have been failing over the last three years.  I have sent an e-mail to the Cisco Small Business Team and I will post a follow-up if there is a resolution or a lack of resolution to this problem in September.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE Thursday, January 5, 2012:  This is my final follow-up on the WAP4410N. This last Fall (September 2011) Cisco replaced all of our WAP4410N hardware version 1 devices with version 2 devices. We continued to have problems with all of the WAP4410N devices until I changed their parameters as follows:  Force LAN Port Speed to 100M:  Enabled  Wireless Network Mode:  G Only  Key Renewal:  36000  All other parameters are set to factory default and the devices all have with a Static IP Addresses.  I have to say that Cisco attempted to solve the problem and they where very nice about replacing all of our hardware version 1 devices with version 2 devices, but finally the only way to stablize the devices was to limit their wireless capability to G only and limit their wired interface speed to 100Mbps.  The WAP4410N access points are all connected to Cisco 2960-S switches, which are 1Gbps switches, but in the past they have been connected to Dell and AdTran switches and they have always had the same problem.  I do have to thank Cisco for making an effort to fix the problem, but at this time we have budgeted to replace all of the WAP4410N access points with an Enterprise controller based system and will donate the WAP4410N access points to charity.",

I'm about as hard as you can be on a gamepad since I'm a competitive street fighter 4 player so it wasn't any surprise when my D-pad went out after almost a year of abuse from my vigorous street fighting. The Logitech gamepads are very responsive and have great dual analogs and a button setup identical to the Playstation 2/3 controller (even the buttons on the analogs you can push in) which is great for all the recent console ports to PC like Devil May Cry, Resident Evil 5, and the fore mentioned Street fighter 4. Really it covers all of your bases and shouldn't give out on you like mine did unless you are inputting ridiculous fighting combos for hours on end.         Save yourself the headache of getting an Xbox for windows controller, Logitech is more responsive, and doesn't stop working for no reason without a fix to get it going again (The xbox ones do this) about the only drawback I can think of is that they are not wireless, but with the pricetag and horrible performance of the wireless PC gamepad options out there, you will forgive having to be tethered to a cord.    What are you waiting for? If you need gamepads for your PC then order a used set of these on amazon already.

Drops the wi-fi frequently so anything that doesn't load entirely at one time (i.e. book, newspaper) involves a lot of waiting and re-booting.  Sound is inadequate.

My original review is still pretty accurate, except I haven't been noticing the problem with downloads as much.  Maybe the problem is with my wi-fi?  Anyway, I still use this daily and I do get frustrated with the battery life.  I have not been easy on this. I have dropped it many times and don't have a light touch when using the screen.

Enough has been written about the 6870 GPU itself, so you'll believe me that so far it has run every game I threw at it perfectly (paired with a slightly outdated Core 2 Quad CPU), and I have no regrets.  The only thing that's slightly annoying (and I'm taking one star of the rating for it) is that the default fan settings are less than optimal. On an idle desktop the fan runs at 40%, which is already fairly loud. Under load, however, it spins up even more, producing a noise level that I consider almost unacceptable.  However, with a utility of your choice (I used MSI's Afterburner in Windows and the simple aticonfig command under Linux) you can customize the fan profile. And lo and behold, 20% fan speed is completely sufficient to maintain a low GPU temperature when idling, while 40-45% seems to be enough under load (when gaming for instance).  All in all, a great card with a small flaw (that can be corrected to some extent).",

I plugged in one of them right when they came in and it synced immediately.  It's worth mentioning that they are dual voltage (i.e. can work on US or European power grids, 110-240v) and they seem to work on different circuits.  The one I plugged into my garage is on a different sub-distribution panel (it supplies power to my garage/laundry room/patio but is a different breaker box from my main house) and works perfectly fine.  I was also very surprised that the one in my upstairs game room works even though it is connected to a transformer (converts European 220v power to US 110v), I am extremely pleased with these!",

The included TV scheduler works fine too. I use the \\\\\"record\\\\\" function on my cable box rather than the IR blaster, though. This assures the correct channel is selected and prevents someone else from inadvertently changing the channel during a recording.    It records fine using my dual core 16 GHz laptop. However, since the Hauppauge encodes the h.264 files on the fly, they are quite large and I need a faster computer than this to watch the original videos. But, if I further process them, even retaining the original 1080p resolution, the files play fine on this computer. Processing is very time consuming though, so I got a WD TV HD Media player.

Of course, make sure your desktop PC is compatible and has an extra PCI slot to slip the card into. I also have a Klipsch THX 2.1 speaker system, and now my computer sounds terrific through that.    2. Yes, the software that comes with the Creative Audigy SE card has an EQ for adjusting bass, treble, etc. Sounds huge! Just make sure you install the neccessary software from the CD.    So, if you want an excellent sound card for listening to music, watching videos, movies, etc., I think you will like this card.",

It is not worth saving a few dollars for something that could ruin your Surface and might even burn your house down.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the metal tabs on the part that plugs into the wall were so thin that they wouldn't make contact with the outlet - it just slipped out with no resistance. Luckily that part from the original power supply still fits this &#34;replacement&#34;. The magnet isn't nearly as strong as the original so it pops off the side quite often during any amount of movement. It doesn't quite fit as well physically, so it's tough to get lined up and attached in the first place. Another bad feature is the little white LED that indicates charging on the OEM is replaced by a bright white LED that says on all the time, even when the Surface isn't attached which I suppose is useful of you need a nightlight.<br /><br />Less than a week after I bought this, I was just using my Surface as usual when the magnetic connector popped off the side, as usual. When I tried to put it back, it made a audible POP, a visible spark, and my screen went blank. It wouldn't turn on and didn't show any battery status. Nothing at all. I was pretty sure it had just turned my Surface into a paperweight.<br /><br />After managing to get some functionality back from my broken OEM charger, I realized all was not lost and this malfunction had only shorted out and discharged the battery to 0%, not even enough for the low battery indicator, but luckily didn't fry the hardware.<br /><br />I then contacted Microsoft and it turns out you can still get refurbished OEM changers directly from them.

As of this review posting, the price difference is just a dollar. Essentially these (A30 & A60) are the same 2.5&#34; HD. Inside the so called &#34;armored&#34; case is a Seagate / Samsung ST1000LM024 SATA II HD with a rotational speed of 5400 RPM & a 16 MB Cache.& made in China. Although the Silicon Power EHD itself are made in Taiwan.<br />The main casing is made of black hardened plastic ( not ABS plastic) with embossed honeycomb design on top & bottom surface and a frosted textured 1/2&#34; border. The 6 orange knobs surrounding the A30 edges are made of silicone rubber which serves 2 purpose: 1] to hold the supplied USB 3.0 cable and 2] to serve as a shock or impact absorber in case you drop it on its edges. NOTE:If you drop this drive flat on its top or bottom plastic surface; good luck. As with any portable EHD, including this, take care not to just flop it on the table. Lay it down gently to avoid early HD death.<br />The A30 comes with 13&#34; ( end to end ) USB 3.0 cable.with Male A terminals on each end. Either terminal ends of the cable could be plugged to the upper left edge of the A30's USB port, which is also backward-compatible with any USB 2.0 devices. BUT the data transfer speed would be slower using a 2.0 attachment or device. Also the A30 has no blinking LED lights unlike other mainstream EHD, although the A30 has 4 micro ( philips) screw slots on each corner of its bottom plate to access the drive itself. This is a plus compared to other mainstream EHD out there, where you have to pry their brittle plastic enclosure and may cause scratches or damage of the casing.<br />The A30 comes formatted in Fat32 and upon initial opening (not physically) of the drive on my PC, I found some files already in it, mostly warranty, registration links, icons, images, etc.which amounted to a few kilobytes. But when checking on the drive's Properties it showed only about 930 Gb of usable storage, and there's the missing 70 Gb. This is normal on EHD's. In general, for each gigabyte reported on the box, you'll have about 70MB less space when you plug it in\u2014which means that your 1TB drive has closer to 900GB as measured by Windows. For 'Gigabyte Hungry' users, this might be an issue and reformatting the drive to NTFS would hardly make a difference (which I did).<br />As for data speed transfer, it's up there with other big name EHD (Seagate Backup Plus/ Solutions, Western Digital Passport Ultra) reaching up to about 120 MB/s write speed (hooked up on a USB 3.0 terminal on a PC}. All in all, this is one portable EHD hard to beat when it comes to price to performance - value ratio. As for durabilty - it all depends on the users habits in handling their portable drives. All drives, no matter what the brand is, gives up when handled roughly.ounted to a few kilobytes.

For example, one of the DSM updates caused my NFS performance to drop by 80% or something. Synology fixed that pretty quickly and if I'd paid more attention, I would have just waited a couple of more days before updating.  Also, some of the software packages don't work so well, like Plex, but that's not why I bought this box anyway.<br /><br />This has been a fantastic device for me in every way.  I'm using VMWare ESXi in a lab and I am also using it for backups and serving music via iTunes as well. It's also my main VPN server via the OpenVPN packages.

Over the last three years, I've gone through a GTX 480 (so hot and loud), 2xGTX 460s in SLI (great bang for your buck but hot and loud), and 2x6970s in Crossfire (extremely loud and too many driver issues!).<br /><br />For my latest build, I went with the GTX 670 because many review said it wasn't worth it to get a GTX 680 because it was only 5-10% faster.  I am happy with the decision that I made.  This card runs not too hot and is surprisingly close to silent in my Fractal Designs Define Mini case.  The performance is faster than two of my 6970s in crossfire and doesn't have any compatibility issues.  I've tested it with games such as Saints Row The Third, Borderlands 2, and many others and I rarely if ever drop under 60 frames per second (i7-3770k @4.20Ghz, 16GB RAM).  What's best about this card is that if I were to upgrade monitor resolutions to greater than 1080p, it'll have enough video memory (4GB) to handle it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this card!!!",

I flipped the switch and the shaders unlocked by themselves. I didn't have to do any thing but flip the little switch. Two of my friends also bought this same GPU, one off of the egg, and the other off of Amazon. Both of their GPUs unlocked exactly like mine did. For those of you who don't know it is located on the top of the card, by the crossfire connector underneath the plastic heat sink cover. Took me a while to find it, but it works great. For BF3 I run it unlocked and at 950/1350 @1120 in Sapphire's TRIXX software. This makes it so easy to turn it into a 6970 at $100 cheaper. At default high settings for BF3 I get 40-80 frames a second. Most of the time it is at 60, but when alot of things are exploding or falling down it drops to 40. Haven't seen it below 40 though. I also play WoW @ ultra and get great frames(60-100). Although WoW is more CPU limited than GPU limited, an upgrade to my processor will help my frames out alot.

After over a year of daily use, our first laptop is still running just as perfectly as when we took it out of the box, so we were a \\\\\"go\\\\\" for purchasing a second one for me.  We both use our computers to play WoW and it runs perfectly on the \\\\\"good\\\\\" graphics setting.<br /><br />This laptop is a slightly better model than our first one, and wasn't that much more expensive.  The upgraded graphics card and audio output of this model is fantastic, a definite step up from last years purchase.  I haven't had this specific laptop very long, but based on the other Acer we purchased, I expect this one to last a while also.<br /><br />My only suggestion is to spend a couple hours when you first get it set up to delete all of the trash programs they pre install on these.  That's my only complaint with Acer, and I'm sure it's part of what makes their machines so inexpensive, but it's really annoying trying to figure out why it's lagging and then realize there's about 40 background programs I have no desire to have on my computer running in the background.

After many, many hours searching for solutions, I was even more upset.  This model & ALL Intel Core processors are not & will never be compatible with Win 8.  Furthermore, even if you try to upgrade to a better version of Win 7, Acer will NOT support your device, as it is not original OS.  I am not very computer savvy.  I would like to rely on companies to properly advertise and promote their products and maybe even make them user friendly.  This is more of an Intel issue, but Acer needs to be a a lot more open about the fact that this product cannot be upgraded & not warranted if you do.

Pros:  Lights - There are three colors of backlighting, as opposed to this board's near competitor - the Sidewinder X4.  Macros - The macros are easy to program, either on the fly or with Logitech's macro editing program.  Sound - Sound quality through the attached headphone jack is excellent for a keyboard.  Cons:  Poor Paint Job - The first thing I noticed when I pulled the keyboard out of the box was that the \\\\\"J\\\\\" key was a dark black, while the rest of the keys are a dark steel grey. Not too noticeable when it's on my desk, but it's the main reason I decided to review the keyboard. On closer inspection I also discovered that a few of the other keys are splotched, partly black, partly steel grey. It's almost like the final coat of paint didn't make it onto parts of the keyboard.

My PC only recognized it as a 2TB drive. I first thought it was a problem with the drive, but after doing some investigation, I confirmed with Sabrent that it only supports up to 2TB. This was purchased on the Amazon website but fulfilled via Tiger Direct, so I've got to contact them to return it. Hassle.    In addition, one other thing I really don't like about it is that the fan comes with a really bright blue light presumably to convey how effective the fan is in keeping the drive cool. I have my PC in the same room as my TV, and when I'm not using my PC, I keep my monitor off to keep the room dark. Unfortunately, there's this really annoying bright blue light that I can't get rid of.    On the positive side, it is very quiet and was easy to set up.    In sum, if you are using this for a 2TB or less hard drive and you don't mind a bright blue light, this enclosure should work fine for you.",

Last month I decided to give my mobile pc's a rest..not to mention my batteries&#34;hot battery..killing my cell phones&#34;.

No more using my hubby's personal pc. To be honest this chromebook and the convience of these features made me feel at ease. No enrolling in computers 101 for the time being.

The USB 2.0 slots on the machine do not operate appropriately at times; they also do not supply enough power to run an external hard drive. I am sure they could easily run a flash drive but not a hard drive. Also, my USB based keyboard works all the time in one of the USB slots, but is very finicky when plugged in to the other USB slot. The only other issue I have with this product is I am getting horrid battery life. I can charge the battery all night and it seems like the tablet only lasts 1-2 hours before needing another 8+ hour charge again. But to conclude this review...You get what you paid for. I was in the market for a very cheap tablet and it's what i got, so can't complain too much.",

I did however discover I'm not the only Paperwhite owner w/ this problem. Many others out there asking for help/ solution to this issue as well.<br /><br />Finally, disgusted w/ lack of support/ fix & thinking the WiFi radio in my unit had died, I ordered a new 2nd gen Paperwhite. Unfortunately, this one had the same issue & I've returned it.<br /><br />I have always been a big fan of Amazon's service & support. However, I've found their Kindle support structure sub-par. I guess I'll resort to loading books via USB from my PC until this has been fixed. Steer clear of Amazon's Paperwhite.",

All of the other screen protectors I've used have some level of blurriness or a sparkly look to it. I highly recommend this as an economical way to get three well-cut crystal clear films. It will show fingerprints a little quicker than, for example, the Griffin Screen Care protector, but it's FAR easier to clean vs. matte protectors.  That said, it is VERY difficult to install without bubbles/dust/etc underneath. To do it properly requires two things:  1. A dust-free environment: I highly recommend doing this in a a bathrom after you've had a shower. This will reduce both the dust in the general environment and the dust/particles generated by your hair & skin.  2. VERY carefully line up the camera and the home button. Then push down one corner, lift up all of the rest, then start from that corner and work the bubble toward the opposite corner across the screen.  With this method I've applied 5 of these with only one small bubble on one of the iPads, which was on the border, not the screen. Good luck!",

My rig is highly tuned to the perfect balance of speed and stability.  My OS is squeaky clean.  I'm highly selective of my peripherals.  That is why I purchased the Logitech Performance MX 7 years ago.  It was the best wireless mouse in the market.  With Windows 8.1 (UI/UX nightmare of an OS), the Logitech Performance MX struggled to communicate efficiently with the OS.  The 125Hz polling rate and 1500DPI was simply too slow.  It lagged, it jumped, it was stuttered both in and out of games.<br /><br />It was time for a new mouse.  It has to be wireless.  It has to be a gaming mouse.  It had to be fast and accurate.  The G700S was exactly what I needed.  With a polling rate of 1000Hz and 8200DPI, it performed literally 10 times better than the Performance MX.  The difference was night and day.  Everything, and I do mean everything is now completely fluid.  ZERO lag.  No stuttering, no choppy movements whatsoever.  The weight, feel, and grip is drastically better.  My only regret is not having upgraded sooner.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Use this with the Logitech G440 gaming mouse pad if you want the most exact and accurate mouse movements.  Logitech engineers have tuned the lasers and optics on the G440.  It makes a HUGE difference if you need pixel precision movements.",

I managed to get the warranty replacement before it expired and got a new one which I am currently have been using for a good year. This time I found the critical problem with this headset: There is this small plastic seam across the phone connectors. Right now, there is a clear sign of the plastic connection stretching (it looks whitish). I don't know how long these will last, but I will be very careful with them. Get them if you want, but be very careful with them, and check the warranties with these.<br /><br />Update 31/12/2014:<br />After a few more months of wear, the headphones are about to snap. The white spots (signs of plastic stretching) are now on both sides of the headset. I am gonna try to melt some of that plastic with a soldering iron to make it last a bit longer, but I doubt it will last long. Sound and mic are still in top shape, but I have decided to reduce the rating of this product. For only lasting a year, I cannot recommend it. but i will give it a point for the good sound and mic (sound is dolby digital 7.1, c'mon).",

It originally worked but was incredibly slow and then on about the third time of use it could not be found.  Following which the wire connection to a laptop on a docking station failed to work - the laptop on the docking station could 'see' the Router but not the network or internet, other wired computers were fine and turning the wireless on (and then off) on the docking station laptop resolved the problem.  But it occurred every time the laptop was undocked/docked.  The USB storage could still not be accessed from any computer.<br />OK so it probably has something to do with the laptop being taken back and forth on and off the docking station, and if all it had required was a reboot of the laptop each time then that could have been lived with but with paying extra and the USB not working, it is going back before being stuck with it and the (almost ten years old now) DI-624 is back in service.",

The case doesn't feel solid, and when you pick up the tablet you hear (and feel) that annoying creaking sound as if the case isn't 100 percent fitted.

There are 2 pieces to the A/C adapter, the one that has the rectangle box and inserts into your laptop for power and the 2nd piece which plugs into the rectangle box and then goes out to the A/C - electrical outlet.  Well, the first piece that plugs into the computer - the wire failed, broke apart from the plug side,AGAIN.<br /><br />It is imnportant to get a new adapter so you are not moving the cord around trying to hit the spot where you can see it is really charging your machine...  when the wire goes bad you are jangling the connection cord all around like crazy trying to keep your computer powered up.  Well, my cord came apart - it literally broke away from the \\\\\"plug\\\\\" part that you insert into the computer.  BTW, if you keep jangling this cord around to get juice, you will eventually screw up the plugs' receptor on the \\\\\"inside\\\\\" of your computer; and no one, repeat no one will repair/replace that internal receptor.  How do I know this you ask?  The A/C adaptor to my previous Dell 600m broke the same way this A/C adapter broke...  Tried to have it fixed after all it is a cord connection issue - wouldn't electrical tape work???  The wire/cord attachment of the adapter) couldn't be fixed.  So I bought a new A/C adapter for my 600m (really expensive laptop) and by that time the interior receptor was loose, almost broke and no A/C adapter cord/piece would stay inside the laptop and power it!!!  I was totally bummed, all my stuff was on that laptop.<br /><br />So here I am with my 1.5 - 2 y.o. Dell 1545 and the SAME DARN THING HAPPENS AGAIN!!!

It's not just me, it's not just the way I use my laptop, or the way it is situated in relation to where/how the A/C plug fits into the computer - is your wire straight coming out the side? Does it make a turn around your computer in the back or front to reach your electrical outlet, etc....<br /><br />The problem is the totally rotten vendor Dell uses for this A/C Adapter.

Totally beyond my comprehension.  This incredibly irritating problem - alone - may make this my 3rd and final Dell machine.<br /><br />Now, onto the seller of the new A/C Adaptor:  GREAT, it is actually the perfect part, it is plugged in and my laptop's battery is 100% charged and I am working from the actualy electrical outlet, not draining down my battery while the machine cannot be charged and I have to turn off my computer ;-(((  The price was reasonable, the new A/C Adaptor has the same wattage, the piece/round plug like thingie is a hexagon shape vs. the usual round plug and my laptop is once again usable whenever I want.  Kudo's to the supplier of this part.  No tricks, no frustrations, plain and simple - it is the right part for the job and it took a few days (I was waiting with baited breath for its arrival), but it really, actually works!  100% - you can buy this part from this supplier and get what you need!!!n the back or front to reach your electrical outlet, etc....

For blazing fast performance.<br /><br />And other good thing about this laptop is that comes with USB 3.0. Also comes with WiDi (Intel WiDi HD Wireless Display technology); so far I test it and works \\\\\"fine\\\\\", by \\\\\"fine\\\\\" I mean it works, it has some glitches transmitting the wireless signal, some times you get a yellowish squares kinda thing at the bottom of TV, but overall you can watch a movie no problems over this feature. Thought I maybe wrong cause could be a problem of the receiver device which is this [[ASIN:B0033WWAF0 NETGEAR Push2TV TV Adapter for Intel Wireless Display PTV1000 (Black)]], but don't know yet. I'll keep digging on this issue and will post back if I find a solution or something.<br /><br />Hope this review help!!! Happy Shopping!!!<br /><br />Update (26-11-2012)<br />Everything is working great and upgraded to [[ASIN:B003DZJQQI Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2CP51264BC1339)]] this memory modules and everything works so much better.

Granted, I am not a 'hardcore' music listener, so I couldn't say if they would be good enough for someone wanting *the best* sound quality. However, I can't hear a difference between these and my roommate's high-end speakers.  I mainly use them to watch movies, listen to music, and voicechat online, and usually keep both the subwoofer and the master volume at about 60%, which is more than enough (max volume is MUCH too loud for my small room).  I had no problems setting them up, and splitting the cord between the speakers gave me sufficient room to space them out.  The volume control feels slightly flimsy but is easy to use and I haven't had any problems with it.  All in all, I would recommend them to anyone without hesitation.",

The reason why it is rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how THIN the base is.  The GoFlex fits directly on it, so there is no extra to the base.  It is not very sturdy.  I recommend placing it somewhere on your computer desk where you will NOT be working or moving.    Additionally:  Some devices do not recognize this as a USB 3.0 dock.  I have an ASUS RT-68R router that will accept this device as a USB2.0 device but not as USB3.0.  I tested the dock on my computer to ensure it is read as a 3.0 and it is.

I am somewhat concerned with the heat.  I had a 250gb drive fail recently (not a simpleshare) and the data loss was devastating.  Heat wasn't the cause but in reading about drive recovery I learned that heat is not good for drives.  We'll see how long this drive lasts.

I received an email reply one or two  working days later with directions to get the computer to recognize the flash drive. When that didn't work, Verbatim requested my contact information and the receipt.<br /><br />After customer service provided an RMA, I mailed the defective flash drive.  Soon after, I received a brand new flash drive in the mail... about two weeks in total duration from when I submitted the claim.<br /><br />This is only the second time I can recall returning a product under warranty and I am satisfied with the outcome. The process worked well, with no delays and no run-around. So 5 stars for Verbatim's customer service.<br /><br />RED FLASHING LIGHT:<br />I also am pleasantly surprised that the new flash drive includes a red activity light. The original one didn't light up. I suspect this is a new feature since the 4 GB flash drive that is working doesn't light up either.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Verbatim lived up to their warranty with no fuss and no runaround.<br />- The brand new replacement flash drive works just fine and has 4 years left on the warranty.<br />- The new flash drive has a red indicator light.<br />- It has a slider instead of a cap which can get misplaced.<br />- The opening for a key chain is big enough.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I had to mail the defective drive back, but I'm satisfied that Verbatim made good on their warranty.<br /><br />TIP:<br />- I don't always keep receipts and warranty information, but it's not such a bad idea, especially for bigger purchases..",

Cons:  - Camera (Nikon D7000) shows a card error occasionally. Pulling the card and reinserting corrects the problem. Since the card error locks up the camera until you clear it, I can't rely on this card to let me take that once-in-a-lifetime shot as the camera may lock up unexpectedly.  - Desktop software is awful. I delete files from the desktop software interface, and they don't go away. When you open a thumbnail, you see a relatively small photo with no options to zoom, see exif data, etc. If you click the \\\\\"i\\\\\" button, you see a map and the option to open the photo using other software. Why even bother showing me the photos in the software if you can't do anything with them - just show them in the operating system.  - Transfer is erratic. This problem also exists in the 4GB card I have. You may need to cycle power on your camera to get the card to \\\\\"wake up\\\\\" and send its photos to the net. This problem occurs on both my cameras.  - Ad-hoc network transfers were erratic and error prone. In ad-hoc mode, my phone frequently lost connection with the card and re-initialized wifi search. There is no option to configure where files are stored using ad-hoc mode on the phone, so they quickly fill the internal memory, making this option basically useless.  - There is no way to configure enterprise or gateway type wifi networks that require multiple authentication steps or user name + password.  - The card draws a lot of battery power from your camera.  - The web site does not let you group photos for different clients and provide access on a per user/group basis. It simply groups them by date and you can share a simple link to show photos, but only links within a date group. If you want to share links from differentdates, you must send multiple links.  Pros:  + The concept is great, and when it works, the option to not pull cards to upload pics is nice.  + It usually works as a regular SD card.  + The web site does allow you to multi-select photos and packages them into one zip for downloading.  If I can correct the card error problem, I will live with the other shortcomings, all of which have workarounds. It's too bad this doesn't work as well as promised, as the concept is really nice.",

Windows said the device was working properly but gave no other information. I restarted my computer and this time it displayed correctly and showed that it had my old copy of Ghost in the Shell (I wondered where that was) in the drive.

I dislike reading on an electronic device rather than a real book. While there is no replacement for the real thing..the look, feel, cover,etc, the Kindle Voyage makes me honestly forget that I'm using an electronic device which is pretty darn amazing. I broke down and splurged on this because a lot of books are starting to come out only on e-books/kindle formats or it takes years for a paperback version of it. My public library, has a vast collection of books and does have e-book checkout now however there are still many books not available through my public library and our interlibrary program doesn't always gets the books I want (not really the library's fault though). I also purchased on Prime Day for 40% off a 2-year Kindle Unlimited subscription. Without the Prime Day deal I would not have purchased the 2-year subscription maybe just the 6 month one. In order for me to use my Kindle Voyage to the fullest it was really required to get the Kindle Unlimited subscription since a good number of books I read were available via Kindle Unlimited (really the subscription pays for itself if you consider buying just a few books on Kindle). I would also say a case for the Kindle Voyage is a must. I can see where the PagePress might accidently be touched in error if holding the Voyage without a case. I also think the case make the experience more like reading a book for me at least. I bought the &#34;Fintie Kindle Voyage Slim Fit Folio Premium PU Leather Book Style Case Cover with Auto Sleep/Wake (will only fit Amazon Kindle Voyage 2014), Navy&#34;-(currently at $13.99) and it works very well and is comfortable to use with the Voyage. The auto sleep/wake function is just awesome. Me being left-handed I really love the feature of the PagePress. Ultimately the PagePress and auto-brightness setting (which I use all the time) are why I chose the Voyage over the newest Paperwhite (not sure if I would have noticed the 0.9 oz difference in weight). I do agree with others that the price is a bit steep (I paid $219.00 as I chose the Voyage without the special offers which only cost $20 to do and seemed worth it to make my experience less intrusive) and that would be my main gripe about it. Still ultimately this is a great device and if anything doesn't turn out right I will update my review :)",

It seemed that most of the negative comments were due to a lack of understanding of the product.   Some of those negative comments:  1. Very thin (Yes, that is correct. However, thin equals lightweight in this case, as well as not adding bulk to the Kindle Fire.)  2. Plastic - seems cheap. (IMO, the plastic has a high tech look and feel to it. It is the lightly rubberized/matte plastic that you see in many iPhone covers. I'm very pleased with its appearance. Comments that I received when I showed it around were all positive.)  3. Difficult to insert the Kindle Fire into the cover. (I read the instructions and placed one edge in first. The other edge easily clipped in with no effort. Incidentally, the clips do NOT impinge on the front of the Fire at all, leaving the entire face uncovered. I like that aspect quite a lot.)  4. Cheap elastic band to hold cover closed. (I do find the elastic a bit awkward to use. You reverse it whey you go from closed to open. Cheap? It seems sturdy and adequate for the job.)  5. The slot to hold the cover in place when you turn it into a stand doesn't work. (It actually works great when the Fire is in the cover. I'm pretty impressed with the minimalist design. It does look like it won't work, but does its job great.)  So....  I am very impressed with the cover. It's a fine bit of very successful industrial design - simple and functional. I recommend this cover for purchase if you're looking for sleek, understated, high tech look, and functional.",

I'm now playing around with it and setting it up for her before she comes next week. I hadn't used Vista or Windows7 before and I wasn't too hopeful but so far I've been impressed. It seems very stable and quick to boot up and shutdown. I have a very expensive Dell laptop for work, and all this weekend when I've wanted to use the internet I've actually used the Acer as its faster than the Dell.    Battery life seems very good so far.... single charge and more than 5 hours and counting on this first charge. Despite the very low price it doesn't feel cheap. My girlfriend has a Acer Aspire one, which she bought for 350USD a few months ago, and for the extra 50USD, there is no comparison.    The only negatives I had read in reviews was the mousepad but so far I've found it to be quite nice. The proof of the pudding will be whether my Mum can use it, so we'll reserve final judgement on that till she's played with it for a while.    I would have a really, really hard time convincing myself to spend any more money on a laptop after using this Acer for a few days.

It is one of the few 14\\\\\" light weight computers that offer an optical drive and finger print identification which I love. As others have mentioned, the volume keys are right next to the internet key, and I have frequently inadvertently turned the internet connection off... this is very annoying to have to wait to re-log-on when you have a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time. This is a very poor design flaw, and clearly indicates the product was not adequately people tested before producing it. Seems like a no-brainer that having these keys side by side is a bad idea. The second major problem initially was that because the key labels are red, they are very difficult to see. Good lighting is a must especially when you are trying to avoid inadvertently pressing the internet key thereby disconnecting the internet. Lastly, and more importantly, the computer just stopped working entirely last week. After taking the computer to my campus IT (who were at least as confused as I about what the problem was), after trying to reboot and trying to re-load windows (because windows wasn't being detected) found that apparently the hard drive cannot even be detected. This is very bad... So, as we all know, this means I will need to spend exorbitant amounts of time in phone jail with HP reps who will forward me to multiple individuals and who (because English is not their first language) will be difficult to understand, and will also have a hard time understanding the gist of what I am saying as well. I can also likely count on this being an extremely time consuming process during a time when I don't have this kind of time to waist. I purchased this computer specifically because I am writing my dissertation, and my prior computer was getting old. I didn't want to take the chance that my old computer might crash, and I might then lose all my dissertation work. As it turns out, my old computer might have been a better gamble, because although this computer is brand new (purchased in June 2012), I lost all my work anyway. So, on top of the time I am likely to spend in phone jail with HP, I also must try to re-write material I was trying to avoid losing (and having to re-write) by purchasing this computer. What a tangled web we weave... I will update you when I get a resolution, but I don't look forward to the battle ahead with HP.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Finger print log on (not often offered on light weight computers)<br />Optical drive included (not often offered on light weight computers)<br />Light weight<br />Fast<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Audio superiority- It is not a noticeable difference<br /><br />Cons:<br />Volume keys right next to internet key causing multiple inadvertent internet disconnections<br />Red key board littering makes seeing the keys extremely difficult<br />Computer hard drive crashed and is not even detectable now (computer only purchased 3.5 months<br /> ago)<br />Too much bloat-ware",

I can see future generations where you don't need to purchase a separate device with a light for night reading and damage protection.

            "input": "Update April 24, 2013: I'm still using this case to protect my iPad2 and it continues to look great! The only minor issue I have is that if you don't pay attention, the little blocks/slots embedded in the case to allow you to adjust the angle of the iPad2 slip more easily than when the case was new, but it's more of an annoyance than a true problem.<br /><br />Update October 26, 2011: I'm still using this case on a daily basis and it's holding up great! I'm very protective of it, but it still looks new and the elastics are holding up just fine. Coworkers keep asking where I bought my case :). I accidentally dropped my iPad2 from the edge of a table, but it was in the cover and fortunately fell flat, parallel to the floor. My iPad2 remained intact and continues to work well.<br /><br />I should point out first that the case I received is not the case shown in the picture at the top of this page. The case I received does not have a small button clasp thing on the front of it. Instead, it stays closed because there are small round magnets lining the edge of the case. This also serves to put my iPad into sleep mode whenever I close the case.<br /><br />I've had this case for two months now and these are some thoughts based on my experience using it daily:<br /><br />PROS:<br />This case looks very professional and all my coworkers asked me how much it was and where I bought it. Unlike other reviewers, I had no trouble using all four viewing angles without it falling over. I am also able to use the camera that faces me easy and it is very easy to put my iPad into the case or take it out whenever I need to. When I use my other (skintight, not folio/stand) case, I definitely miss the ability this case has to angle my iPad towards me and keep it stable so that I can actually use it.<br /><br />CONS:<br />If your ipad is jailbroken and you use the SBsettings menu/toggle, the edge of the case that holds the iPad snug covers up the very top status bar of the iPad. This makes it difficult to activate that menu using the default swipe action. I was also worried about scratching or denting the edges of my iPad, since this case does not provide any protection for them. To this end, I bought a thin skintight case for my iPad with the hope of using that to protect the edges while it was in this case. But, this case holds the iPad so close that it does not fit even with such a thin cover. Also, the elastics that hold the two corners of the iPad in place so that it doesn't move feel secure even after two months, but i dont know how long they'll last.<br /><br />OTHER THOUGHTS: I'm not sure what the red accented elastic running down the side of my case is for. My best guess is that it is for holding papers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really sleek-looking case that is very useful if you're tired of finding random items to prop up your iPad2.",

I looked at the purple mouse and thought I really don't like the color (I just don't like purple in general) so I decided to get one in dark grey. I luckily found one. It was refurbished but it works perfectly. The color wasn't exactly the ONLY reason I got another one though. I think I used the mouse for like... two - three years.

So I switch it off. And then I turn it on again soon. I'm kind of the type that multitasks. Watch a few minutes of a movie then browse some site then watch the movie again. And I fast forward a lot. Anyway, my point is I constantly flip the on/off switch and.... later, that little bump that allows you to move the switch kind of wore off. So it got difficult for me to switch it on and off quickly, even with my long nails. So that's one con....<br />But other than that, I just love the mouse.....

The long cord would come in handy if you're actually intending to use this for internet telephone calls. There's also a volume control with a mute button built into the cord.

Mine looks new except it came in an aftermarket box. It accepted everything I was running on my old computer just fine. My printer works and my old speakers do too.<br /><br />Bought it to replace a virus damaged 7 year old dell with 38% as much memory that was still running XP and had a number of issues.<br /><br />I don't care for windows 8 and at first, I couldn't figure out how to download 8.1 so I downloaded Classic Shell and then later figured out how to download 8.1. I kept classic shell just because Im afraid of getting stuck with something I cant operate.<br /><br />Ive had a few instances where I downloaded long files and it goes into win 8 mode and I don't know how to close it when I get done so I have to \\\\\"control alt delete\\\\\".<br /><br />I have a occasional instances where a page crashes & reopens. Not sure why.<br /><br />I believe this machine has 2 open slots so we could add two more 4gb sticks for a total of 16.  Ive priced it at around $75 but I don't see any need to do it right now.<br />This is my first AMD processor and it seems fine. Of course, my processor speed was rarely the problem with my old machine, limited memory was my problem.<br /><br />All my old computers came with a basic game of solitare. This one does not.<br /><br />And its VERY quiet compared to my old computer.<br /><br />The light on the top of this machine blinks on & off If you forget to turn it off like I do. And being in my bedroom, I don't really like that light flashing while I try to sleep. I just stuck a used giftcard over the light but I guess I should turn it off or at least put in on hibernate because it boots up soquick.<br /><br /> I think my old computer was a core 2 duo and this one really doesn't seem a lot faster expect when rebooting or waking up from sleep mode. But I can tell the difference when multi-tasking & opening multiple windows.<br /><br />The processor is 3.5 GHz, amazon incorrectly showed 3.2 GHz. I think they have changed it now.",

I bought this router because it has four ethernet ports.  I need one for my printer, one for my server and one for my VOIP phone.  For the first three days I was very happy.  I get a full 15Mbps transfer rate when I'm the only device connected but as soon as my wife starts watching Internet videos while I'm working (either wireless or wired), the router starts dropping packets.  Pings to a first-hop DNS server go from 30mS to 400mS and more.  Some times pings go to 2000 mS which is just unacceptable.<br /><br />Of course, there's no way for ME to update the firmware on the router --- that's left to the ISP (Time Warner Cable) to handle so there's absolutely nothing I can do to fix the problem on my side.<br /><br />Again, it doesn't matter if I'm connected wired or wireless.  The problem happens on all devices.  I should have just gotten the forty dollar off-brand wired-only router and hooked up a DDWRT wireless access point.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I took the router back and got a new one.  Same problem.  What complete garbage.  This thing can't handle Netflix (or any streaming content for that matter) without everyone on the entire network -- wired OR wireless -- from suffering.  Packet loss is in the 5% range which is totally unacceptable.  VOIP is almost unusable because every five seconds I get terrible jitter and have to ask the other person to repeat what he just said.<br /><br />Pings to Google's name server at 8.8.8.8 increase by a factor of TWENTY.  One hop pings to my ISP go from 9ms to 520ms and slower.<br /><br />Get this:  Using the router's diagnostic PING utility stops everyone else from initiating ANY new traffic whatsoever.  The router won't even ping Google.  It actually drops ALL pings.  My ten year old Cisco DSL router was far superior to this piece of junk.",

Then reopen the lid and wake up computer, to find that the keyboard now works fine and all lights are working also.  The last thing was the screen is now black.  After some research, two different techs examined it (one at the Sony Store) and both said to replace the motherboard.  The video chip is broke, so the whole board needs to be replaced.  I've 'googled' new boards and cant seem to find a replacement board online.  The Sony Store said I could send it in for repair and that a motherboard repair is considered a 'major' repair, its minimum $300, no parts.  At this point it just be cheaper to buy a new, cheap laptop for that and buy an extended warranty to cover future breakdowns.  Or just consider building a desktop.

The cable still worked fine though the drive to replace it came when I unplugged the laptop and the powerpin that goes in the laptop touched the site of the chew causing the cable to spark. Normally when I need to replace a new power cable, I'll buy a brand new one from the manafacturer or by a Targus adapter. This time I didn't want the Targus adapter because they have alot of connectors, I mean alot, so much that I would lose the right connector in the sea of connectors and I really didn't feel like giving Dell a ton of money for a brand new adapter. So I took a chance and deicided that maybe Amazon would be a good place to buy a cable. So I searched and found this one. It was cheap, too cheap to someone used to paying at least $80+ for one normally but I took the plunge and haven't been dissapointed ever since. The adapter works and looks great and seems sturdy. I also like the fact that it has an 18 month warrenty. Me being a brand loyal consumer means I will probably be a customer for life should I ever need a new adapter, which knowing myself may be very soon when the Surface tablet comes out..",

If the scroll wheel is your archnemesis on a daily basis with what you do on a computer, buy this mouse immediately, even if it puts your bank account into the negative.  Zooming and panning are now effortless and much more elegant.  Modeling large scale objects (corporate skylights in my case) is now a breeze.

Also, you can completely disregard any reviews that complain about not enough programmable functionality in the included software.  UberOptions is a free modification you can find easily on the web that more than makes this mouse as customizable as you want it to be.  Do yourself a favor, and go get this mouse!",

The muffs fit over my ears so there is no pressure, and the padding is very comfortable. This set is great for long nights of gaming. The sounds quality is as good if not better than my creative speakers and they won't wake up my roommate (college dorm). The quick disconnect is a nice feature, but I'm not too lazy to just take them off. The mic. transmits clearly and doesn't pick up too much background noise.     My only con is that I am a large man, 6'3 240, and the ability of the cups to rotate and lay flat on your chest would be a nice feature, but my neck is too large and the cups just end up choking me. Seems like it would work just fine for a smaller person.    If you're not in the market for a wireless headset buy these, you will not be disappointed.",

It seems that there is always 5-10% area showing some degree of ghosting effect(even with LG's own 3D samples) no matter how optimal view position and angle you have adjusted. Sometimes you won't notice it much when watching videos, so the quality is not perfect but acceptable for most of the time.    The 2D quality is disappointing to me primarily because of the bad displaying quality for small text characters(your standard Windows GUI text), it looks somewhat blurred compared to my old HP 20-inch monitor, though the color looks much brighter. The resolution is at the recommended 1920*1080.    If you want an inexpensive way of enjoying 3D movies occasionally and not reading text too much then this one may be a good option.

I haven't had any problems whatsoever with this hard drive. It's been working since I first plugged it in. Take it out of the box, plug in the power and connect it to the PC. I've stored large files on it even in the FAT mode. I keep ebooks, videos, movies, music and pics on it, and I use it every single day.     I have no problem with the speed of downloads and transfers, and frankly I can't understand anyone who does. The only possible conclusion I can come to, is that some people are so used to instant gratification that any delay is intolerable. *Shrug*    I've had no problems with the computer acknowledging the drive, it operates quietly. But then again I have mine set up on a wire rack that doesn't impede airflow around the unit. There are airflow vents even on the bottom of the casing. I can touch it right now and it's cool to the touch. If you've got one set up on a solid surface you're blocking 1/3 of the cooling vents. I suggest investing in a small wire rack. They're cheap. It may not be sexy, but your external hard drive will thank you for it. And if you care more about how it looks than your data. Well what else is there to say?    Maybe all these people with horror stories just got bad units. It happens. There are lemons in any kind of manufacturing. But I can assure you that I will be buying another one of these units to back up the one I have just in case. If you're that concerned about your data, back up your stuff on DVDs or CDs as well, and keep them in a safe location.    There are no guarantees in life and that includes technology, but I've been very pleased with this hard drive. As much as I use it, you would think that if it was going to fail it would have failed already. But everything we buy does age and wear out, so before the next year is up I will be buying a new My Book toreplace this one before the one I'm using wears out.    Having said that, I'll say this. Recently I discovered, to my shock, that good shills, and bad shills, haunt review sites and post good things and bad things about products. This disgusts me. The whole point of reviews is to get information from other people about the product.    I've seen competitors write crappy reviews and the seller shilling with good reviews. The only reviews I trust are my own because I don't spend enough time doing reviews to know who is who, I'm sure a great majority of other people don't either.    Amazon needs to make people reviewing these products sign an agreement that they don't work for the selling company or a competitor and prosecute those who violate the agreement.    I've gotten to the point where I don't trust the reviews here on Amazon. I just find someone I know that has one and I ask them about it. It's too bad corporate America can't produce products good enough to stand behind and feel like they have to put their employees online to tout their products.     If the flipping product is good, you don't have to shill it. And I'll die a thousand deaths before I buy any product I find being sold in that manner. And I won't buy anything from a competitor that uses dirty underhanded tactics to undermine someone else's products.    After all if a company engages in that kind of behavior, how are they going to treat their customers?",

Thus 2 power cables are needed.  I used my 4-pin power cable from my power supply instead of the 4-pin to IDE power cable adapter that came with the unit - both worked, but the power supply 4-pin cable was easier to bend so I used it instead.<br /><br />Once the right SATA connector on the adapter was used, the red light goes on and my Windows 7 OS recognized both my IDE HD and IDE DVD.  I set both HD and DVD to &#34;Master&#34; using the jumpers and all worked fine.  I got this tip from other reviews listed for this product.<br /><br />The only problem really is the length of the SATA cable included and the length of the adapter itself.  Attaching this to my IDE DVD Writer added about 2.5 inches to the back and I had to bend the SATA and power cable to make it fit.  There are 90-degree adapters, but I could not find one that was bi-directional and one in this price range.  I actually used a 90-degree SATA cable that was attached to my SATA harddrive to connect to this adapter and used another longer SATA cable to attach my SATA harddrive to my SATA motherboard since the harddrive position was such that I didn't actually need the 90-degree bend.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the adapter so far.  Not sure how long it will last but at least I can used my IDE drives now with my SATA-only motherboard.",

Most laptop coolers last for days but this one has been holding up pretty well.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />I bought this for a quality laptop cooler but I got much more than I bargained for. Once you hear the sound coming from the speakers you will be astounded. The volume on my thinkpad T400 without using the lapdesk had to put up to its maximum setting (it goes from 0 to 50). I now keep it at around 12. Its like night and day. Its as powerful as my desktop speakers.<br /><br />The bad:<br />I have had a problem with one of the flip up laptop holders. One of them has developed a hairline crack. I called logitech support but they could not replace the part. The product comes with a three year warranty but they don't manufacture it anymore so they don't offer a replacement. I told the person in tech support that this is a great product but it was a little pricey at $69.  They offered to credit me my purchase price (I paid $69 at the time I can't believe they are asking $199 for it now) but not including the sales tax or the cost of shipping it back to them. I then decided to keep it an try some plastic glue. So far so good.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you can find this at under $100 buy it. Its not manufactured anymore so if you want a quality product you will have to pay thru the nose........",

The PSU is directly above where the CPU will go on the motherboard (it covers about half of it) and with the heat sink / fan, at least the one I'm using, is only about a quarter of an inch of room between the PSU and the top of the fan so there is very little / to no room for air flow or getting a non stock heat sink and fan. The case is about 5&#34; tall, the PSU takes up about half of that (2.5&#34;) and my CPU heat sink/fan is just over 2&#34; tall. This in itself can cause the CPU to overheat VERY easily. Make sure your CPU heat sink and fan will fit before buying this too!  Absolutely use the side mounting brackets for the HDD!! If not you will get very cramped and make it extremely more likely the CPU will overheat as mine did. Once I moved it to the side, there were less cables directly above the CPU fan and provided more air flow. I would also definitely recommend a fan or 2 or 3 if you can. I think there is only one 4 pin connector for a fan but you can buy splitters to put more fans in. The more you can cool this tiny thing, the better because it gets hot in there!  Overall I like it for my HTPC but I have had struggles with it.  UPDATE (4-22-15): Until recently I haven't had much need to leave my HTPC on constantly. Now that I'm about to get rid of cable I've been leaving it on more to transfer files and test it out. Just recently I went to it after it would've been on for about 3 days and at some point it restarted due to what I expect to be from overheating. I've constantly struggled with overheating with this box and I've gotten to the point where I am going to buy a new case to see if that helps. There is barely any room for the PSU, CPU, DVD, and HDD to keep cool, and I have a fan and there really is no room either for a non stock CPU heat sink/fan.   I don't recommend this for a high power machine at all.",

I had leaned toward the Beagleboard's, but got caught up in the popularity of the &#34;Pi&#34;. Although the Pi is a great &#34;starter&#34; unit, especially when packaged with a basic electronics kits for learning GPIO, I found the Pi a bit.... lacking. Finally, one day, frustrated with it, I decided to bite the bullet and buy an $85 Bone (heck, I had a $45 Amazon gift card, so why not). Unknown to me, the day before, Beagleboard released the &#34;Black&#34; for $45. So I got excited after looking at the specs and ordered one.<br /><br />When I got it, I plugged it in, and after mucking about on the embedded webpages for not even 10 minutes... I was totally taken aback by the quality, engineering, thorough (and clean) design choices. I have read notes from several hard core Beaglebone developers and there are some things they have minor issues with, regarding GPIO (Which appeared to be a distro problem more then a Beaglebone problem), but for the most part even they couldn't fault the new design. It is clearly, a more mature product then the &#34;Pi&#34;, which makes sense, Beagleboard has been at it longer.<br /><br />There is one &#34;CON&#34; if you want to call it that. the &#34;Black&#34; has one USB A jack, whereas the &#34;Pi&#34; for example has two. That is, the Pi can handle &#34;keyboard&#34; and &#34;mouse&#34; whereas the &#34;Black&#34; can only handle one or the other, without a USB hub. This is a little inconvenient, but considering its other qualities... its barely worth mentioning.",

It's annoying enough (for me) that I wish I had bought something different, assuming there is another mouse out there that would fit the bill for less than $10.

Going from pressing the power button on my laptop to being fully loaded at the desktop (cpu idle, no processes loading) only takes 10 seconds! Battery life was also extended roughly 30 minutes to an hour, since not only is there no hard drive spinning, I've locked down most system writes to only the essentials as well.    Keep in mind I'm using WindowsXP Embedded features and a custom setup. Installing regular windows on this card and expecting it to run fine will cause it to lock up and stutter constantly, as well as completely trash your card in record time from disk writing. Unless you are willing to invest some serious time in to getting it running perfectly and have the technical know-how, I do not recommend trying this for the average user. I managed to burn out a few of the sectors on the card being careless and doing a live setup of XP to integrate the embedded features, instead of setting it up on a virtual machine and prepping the card, but that's the price I paid for being lazy and not too much harm done.    In retrospect, getting a 233x card would have been a much better option, but the 133x is definitely up to the task of turning my old laptop into a speedy web browser and portable music player (through Winamp Remote). Being out around town and stopping in places with free WiFi access was the driving factor, which meant boot times has to be as low as possible.

Looks more expensive than it is. I would bring this into an interview no problem. Shame the black color is out of stock, but the lavender is also very grey-neutral and classy because of the subtle pattern. It looks elegant rather than &#34;girly,&#34; if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Downsides: the plastic case that you snap the iPad into has really sharp edges. This is not a huge problem, but it does take away from the product. Other covers have a more rubbery smooth seal. Kind of feels like someone forgot to glue the rubber seal on! So you might want to run your finger over the edge to make sure it's not really sharp anywhere.<br /><br />Overall: the best rotate/standup iPad cover I've purchased to date.

            "input": "So this lapdesk is essentially just a slab of wood.  That being said it is worth every penny and is the best lapdesk i have ever owned and far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I purchased this lapdesk to replace some aging POS I got from Bed Bath and Beyond.<br /><br />First, while it might be just a slab a wood, the wood is solid, lightweight, and sturdy.  It feels wel crafted.  The angles of the cuts and beveling simultaneously allow for a compact design while making me feel like my available surface area is more than I could need, all while being comfortable to place on my lap.  The vent holes provide adequate ventilation and during this summer my ASUS ROG with a GTX 870m GPU and i7 CPU has not had any heating problems whatsoever, despite me using this desk in bed with covers.  I have not had any discomfort with the bevel edges of the vent cut outs scraping my bare legs in shorts or anything, but if I could make one improvement to this it would be to sand another small bevel to the underside of the vent cut outs.  The rest of the wood desk feels like a solid, single piece (because it is) and the grain is even aligned in a pleasing manner.  I have had no issues with my laptop sliding or moving on the surface, and the wood texture makes the PC feel almost &#34;glued&#34; in place, as if they were one piece, even while tilting it to get up and move about or surviving a random toddler attack.<br /><br />The embedded mouse pad is of high quality, with supple yet firm yield and smooth transition from pad to desk surface.  I see no indications of it wanting to come up or the edges fraying any time soon.  The pad is very large and can accommodate games with fast reaction times and wide view swings (frantic FPS and the like).  It overall is a tad narrower than a traditional gaming mouse pad (by about an inch or less) but it is taller and that extra room is appreciated when doing other tasks like reading long web articles.  The material feels like a roughed felt texture, smooth on the mouse by not aggravating to your wrist or hand as you glide it across the surface.<br /><br />The tablet holder works wonders, but it will not hold most tablets that are in a protective case.  This makes sense as if it accommodated most cases, some cases still wouldn't fit and most not in cases would not fit either.  It fits my 10.1in GalaxyTab Pro just fine but I often find myself using it to hold my phone, baby monitor, or 7in tablet instead.  I have not utilized the power cord cutout, but it would work fine for my 10.1 in wide mode, but it wont really work for smaller devices except as a method of cord organization.  Works well with my wife's iPad (3rd Gen).<br /><br />All in all this desk has revolutionized my free time.  Now I can easily and comfortably move my 17&#34; gaming laptop around while never being cramped for space on the work surface.  I can sit on the couch or recliner and surf the web or play any game I want while my wife watches her TV shows and I don't have to go into another room or sit at a desk.  The height of the computer and mouse when the desk is on my lap makes it comfortable to use even for long periods (2-3 hours) and I find I can sit up against the backboard in bed with the same results.  When moving to a new location the mouse area has enough space for my mouse, headphones, baby monitor, phone/tablet, and ac adapter for the PC without them feeling crowded or screens getting bumped.  The beveled edges and solid construction make it easy to pick up and move my heavy pc with ease.  I couldn't be happier despite the hefty price tag.",

What is special about this drive aside from it being USB 3.0 is the fact that Lexar used SLC flash chips in the Triton series.  Most other USB flash drives offered today use MLC or TLC flash chips, which allow higher capacities but are slower and wear out sooner than SLC chips do.  So when you see this Triton drive in 32GB at nearly the same asking price as some other 64GB drive, that is because the 64GB drive is using the lower grade MLC or TCL chips.  SLC chips have, on average, a 10x longer lifespan than MLC chips.  You're paying more because this drive will last longer.",

The reason is that the cutouts for buttons and camera lenses are specifically designed for that line of devices. It will generally seat a lot of other 7 inch tablets or phones, but the cutouts may not line up.<br /><br />This is an awesome simple product. It's got a soft, squishy (still firm) styrofoamy feel and the Galaxy squeezes in pretty easily, but stays in place. It kind of feels like the material used in life vests (think water skiing). Designed primarily to protect devices from clumsy kids, I don't hesitate to use this as an adult. You immediately get a ruggedized carrier and stand for your tablet! The only downside is that it does slightly increase the size of what you're carrying around so you'll have to decide if the tradeoff is worth it (it is for me). If you use your Galaxy Tab 4 a lot, this is a highly recommended purchase.<br /><br />This is my favorite kind of KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) product. Somebody had a good idea to produce and market a cheap protector, carrier, and stand for the Galaxy tablet. Easy 5 out of 5 stars. If BMOUO makes these for other 7 inchers (with appropriate cutouts), I'm on board too.",

I emailed the seller asking about it and they confirmed that I need that tf card but did not respond as to where I can get it.

My son created a pattern on the tablet that he forgot and I looked up online how to reset it. Every video that showed how to do it did not help. This tablet did not power on and reset how it was supposed to. I followed everything step by step. There are no directions in the booklet that came with the tablet either.<br />I called their customer service # and after the phone rang about 20 times, a voice message came on, I left my info and it has been 3 days and no one called back.

The biggest issue is that it can slip and not fit flush and true over the front screen. Not a huge deal, as you can easily adjust it, but certainly not optimal either.  The magnetic sleep/wake function does work as expected.<br /><br />The stand function is OK, but not great. And when you use it this way, the top flap, which folds back to form the stand, gets creased and so tends to not lay flat on the screen without some help. So, again, a bit less that optimal, but not a deal breaker at this price.<br /><br />For the low price, I am very satisfied with it.

            "input": "Received the unit well packed in it's retail box. In fact the box itself was aesthetically pleasing (akin to Apple product packaging).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The form and fit of the protective case is very good. I have a skin on the back of my iPad which made the shell fit a little snug, but none the less it still fit perfectly. The corner \\\\\"clips\\\\\" were small enough that the edge of the case didn't intrude onto the front of the ipad but meaty enough to provide a firm grip. The case stayed on the iPad even as I put the unit through a series of maneuvers (open, close, spinning the unit horizontal/vertical, adjusted viewing angle and removing from keyboard and mount) without popping off. Even though the corner clips held firm, they were easy to remove and allowed for removal of the iPad without nearly breaking the case.<br />- The access cuts for the headphone jack, microphone, camera, power button, volume control, mute switch, charging port and speaker we spot on. Not only did they fit but the ports, switches, etc were centered perfectly, thus adding to the aesthetic quality.<br />- The ports are also accessible with the unit attached to the keyboard. Charging (both the iPad and keyboard) can be done without having to remove the units.<br />- Another plus is the adjustable viewing angle while using the keyboard attached. By sliding the case mounting tab back you can adjust the viewing angle to meet your particular preference. Sliding the tab out to it's last stop, I was able to create a comfortable viewing angle while holding the unit on my lap.<br />- You can also fold the iPad open all the way down and rest it's back on the keyboard and use the iPad as a touch tablet. The keyboard makes for a solid base. It also provides a slightly elevated viewing angle in landscape mode.<br />- One feature that I particularly like is the ability to remove the protective case and the stand from the keyboard. You can adjust the viewing angle in both portrait and landscape (to a certain degree), unlike Apple's smart cover (which only has 2 viewing angles) (there are a few shortcomings, however, see my comments in the Cons section below).<br />- The ability to totally remove the iPad and protective case from the keyboard and mount allows you to use the iPad as it was originally intended while maintaining the protection of the case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- When using the unit with the keyboard you'll need to be careful on how you open the unit. The hinge was a bit stiff (as I realize it needs to be to hold the unit in position) and the tendency is to open it as one would a laptop. At a certain point the bottom of the iPad will pull away from the keyboard and slide forward (how quickly depends on how much pressure one applies). Once you realize this, it is easy to open using two hands or just pushing the middle of the iPad back after you've separated the units a bit.<br />- With the keyboard removed you can adjust the viewing angle from 90 - 45 degrees (both in landscape and portrait mode). Anything beyond approximately 45 degrees causes the iPad to slide and fall flat on it's back. While there are rubber feet on the bottom of the mount which keep it from sliding the iPad case is smooth and there is nothing to stop it from sliding.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Keyboard: It is functional and is on par with most of the better made keyboards on the market (think Zagg). The small form factor takes some getting used to, but again it's a trade off everyone makes for portability.<br />- Weight: It does add considerable weight to the iPad (the full unit is slightly lighter than the iPad itself), so this is something that one must take into consideration. Do the pluses of the added functionality outweigh (pun intended) the negatives of the weight? Comes down to personal preference.<br />- Matt black plastic finish. Again this will probably be a personal preference issue on whether someone likes it or not. I noticed that oil from my hands show up on the finish (although it's easily wiped away).<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />- If there's a way to build in a rubber/silicone strip along the edges of the protective case this may allow for more viewing angles without the case sliding. Not sure how to do this without making it too obtrusive.<br /><br />Overall the Pros outweigh the Cons and I would give this a 4 out of 5 star rating. I can't comment on the battery life of the keyboard nor the effect the weight will have in the long run until I've used the unit for an extended period.",

I have long been waiting for a lighted display on an ink reader and my husband pre-ordered a Kindle Paperwhite 3G as soon as it was released as a birthday gift.  I received the item today and am immediately returning it.  After plugging it in and turning it on, I immediately saw a VERY bright spot at the lower left corner and a corresponding vertical shadow from the dot upwards.  I felt the surface of the display with my finger, and a dented defect can be felt at that location.  The Kindle was only in my hands and set on my bed during the minutes that I had it out.  I went to my Amazon.com account to see about an exchange, and was instructed to call about a replacement.<br /><br />I spoke to a foreign customer service agent and she was clearly following a script.  I was REPEATEDLY asked if I had traumatized my Kindle device.  The answer was absolutely not because the device was in my hands or on the top of my quilted bed.  I was asked >4 times for my address, and the customer service agent registered my Kindle to my Amazon account against my wishes.  Why register the device when I will never use it?  I also did not feel comfortable returning a registered device because someone else could have access to my Amazon account through that Kindle device.  We were told that we could return the defective device for a replacement, and the new Kindle Paperwhite 3G would take up to 12 weeks to receive.  The current time for a new order is 4-6 weeks.  My husband pointedly asked if we would have 30 days from receipt of the new device to return it if that 2nd device has a problem.  The answer was that our 30 day return window is from the time the first device was received so we would have NO return window on the second replacement device.  We chose to return the device for credit rather than a replacement.<br /><br />The phone conversations took about an hour and ended with complete frustration.  I am an Amazon Prime member and buy items weekly from Amazon.  Worst experience we've ever had with Amazon - shockingly bad.  The display does have vague green/pink hues also and irregular lighting from the bottom.  We bought the Kindle without ads and there are still book ads on the display.  The resolution of the display is clearly inferior to my iPad.  My husband said one pixel was \\\\\"on\\\\\" fully and would not turn off at the defective display location, and he is a computer engineer at a major computer firm.  I plan to look at the new iPad mini before decide what device to buy for the future.  Truly a horrible, disappointing product.  What would happen if the Kindle screen were actually scratched with use???  I had mine for less than 5 minutes before it was clear it was defective, and the exchange/return process was unpleasant.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/31/2012 - I paid $199 for the Kindle Paperwhite 3G without ads.  After seeing the device in person, I think I will not like using it at night due to the white background (a bit of ambient light and brightness) and irregular display.  I read more about all of the Kindle devices and decided to buy a Kindle Fire 7\\\\\" HD for $199.  It does have ads on the opening page, but the book suggestions can be turned off.  The book reading provides an option for a black background with white words, and I can also stream free videos with my Prime membership.  I feel much more like I'm getting my money's work with the Kindle Fire HD, and the book reading is working much better at night (less ambient light that could disturb my husband then the Kindle Paperwhite).  This is an option worth considering for the cost.  I still plan to use my iPad for the apps, 4G, email, photos, etc but the Kindle Fire 7 HD is smaller, has a great display and appears to be a decent way to access Amazon content.",

I was having a battery issue not charging. The problem was fixed, they are sending me out a new Kindle Fire and all I have to do is send back the old one, Not only was it easy, but extremly friendly, no one sided conversation about you did this wrong or that wrong.

It connects to the wifi easily in the restaurant where I am currently enjoying Italian food and wine while trying to write my book.  I had to get on Amazon and review this just to tell everyone that what you have heard about the keyboard is somewhat accurate.  It does not support overly fast typing speeds unless you are very careful and press hard. That being said it does improve your ability to push the keyboard buttons down as you get angry that you have so many typos.  I have had to correct this review twice so far were it has missed letters that  pressed too lightly.  The trackpad sometimes clicks in my text while I'm typing as well when I use the spacebar.  This could be avoided if the computer was lower than me and my hands were not on the laptop.  The battery life is good if you are not doing anything too intense.  It is sometimes hard to click with the trackpad as well.  I have played and enjoyed a few steam games on this computer, Postal 2 mainly, which is an old game but awesome.  I don't have virus protection because I use my Mac for browsing sites that could be dangerous and stick to what I know here.  I do use spybot s&d free and it has found various things to fix but takes a while.  I would have liked blutooth but bought a $10 kinivo transmitter and it works great.  Sound is as expected, pretty good but it's a laptop, what do you expect?  Not as much bass as a subwoofer because the laptop would shake.  I do like that it has a numerical keypad but they put one of the arrow keys where zero usually is so I get out of order sometimes.  I only paid $229 when it was on supersale here and have had it for six months with no issues.  It doesn't come with an installation disc like everything else in the world and I uninstalled most features of which I later needed but the serial key I retrievedfor Windows did not work to download Windows Media Center which I no longer need but heck if I'm going to pay for Windows features!  If I were really concerned with keyboard functionality and the trackpad I would get an additional keyboard and mouse.  I do use a usb mouse for gaming.  Can't go wrong for the price and RAM, my primary reasons for buying.  I like it because I don't worry about it getting hurt (I do everything in the cloud) or stolen.  It is the closest I could get to a good but inexpensive laptop that is basically disposable if need be.  Like if I have it in a hotel room while I am on a mission and the enemy gets the upper hand and I must leave in haste, then I can burn the harddrive remotely.  Yes the camera is lame and not very good quality, don't buy it for that, just get a usb hd camera for $50.  One thing to love over a mac is the extra buttons: home, pgup, pgdown, end, delete, prt sc.  These features are invaluable to me and I have always been disappointed in macs because of them even with the shortcuts that they provide for prints screen functions.",

After my third fan I decided to splurge on a cooling fan that might actually work. From the moment I got it I was impressed! It came in a nice secure box so there was no threat of it being damaged and fits my laptop perfectly. It is made out of a sort of metal which makes it very sturdy. The cord connects to my USB port and then converts to another USB port so I don't lose space for my cords. The fan in the middle is HUGE (about the size of a small plate) and keeps my laptop cool no matter what I'm doing. I can actually feel the cool air from it unlike my old fan. I can even watch movies without my laptop overheating. I definitely recommend it for anyone with a laptop that gets overheated easily!",

I get it, it's not as expensive as others and compact, but it works overall.<br /><br />Secondly, it feels a bit &#34;loose&#34; once I plug it in. I sat for about 10 minutes, going through the motion of &#34;accidentally&#34; getting this snagged on random stuff. I have a dog, he likes to sit with me, sometimes he kicks my laptop while he sleeps. I also have an external wired-mouse and check to see if I lose connectivity if it snags.

Basically, the hub useful if you have run out of USB plugs, otherwise, not so much. I also wish the ring around the adjustable speed adjuster wasn't always lit, it only turns off if the computer is off/it is unplugged. Even if the fan is off, the ring is still on, but that's minor.

A sample was provided in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I recently bought a new Windows computer for my parents, and this cable came in handy to transfer all the files off their old machine. One computer runs Windows 7, and the other runs Windows 8.1.<br /><br />In my tests of durability of this cable, I found it to be quite good. A 24 hour test of keeping the cable bent under a book showed no signs of fraying or wear of any kind. The connectors are solid, and so is the cable, especially near the ends where it is most prone to issue.<br /><br />The cable has two green indicators at the middle of the indicator that show activity from both ends, or in other words, the two computers it is connected to. My newer computer recognized the older one very easily after inserting the included CD for software.<br /><br />Transfer speeds were quite quick. I was able to transfer a 2TB file in about a minute using this cable, to give you a real world idea of how fast it is.<br /><br />Overall, this cable works great. I also measured it, and it\u2019s as advertised - 6 feet! I definitely recommend this for a quick and painless windows file transfer.",

If you're working on a budget look to the Satellite line of Toshiba laptops, they really are an exceptional value for the costs. Alright on to my review,<br />Hey this laptop does everything I want and with Windows 7 and an i3 core, 4GB Memory and 500GB HD this is an awesome laptop for a student, with the power of a Desktop. I only rate mine 5 stars because of the price I got, went to Orifice Max and they had them for $545.99, A SUPER DEAL! If I had to buy it at this listed price I'd say a solid 4 star would be warranted. Either way it's a very good deal, but I hear these models, and its close siblings are being discontinued, so if you want one now's the time. They're being moved for newer stock, and if you don't grab one when you see it you may not see another one for sale again.<br /><br />*REVISION*<br />Well exactly one week after the one year warranty expired the thing locked up and never worked again. Toshiba wanted $200 min to even figure out what was up so I said to He11 with it and cut my losses. If it took a dump that quick I just wasn't willing to invest more in it just to have it take a dump again in a few weeks. I took it to a local tech who said this generation of Satellite had a lot of cut backs and basically Toshiba used the guise of the Satellite name to sell a bunch of poorly made laptops for a few years. When I got it the reviews were probably close to 95% positive, now if you look it's closer to 50/50, NOT GOOD!",

Comparing this to the [[ASIN:B004PLWJCC Rosewill RCX-Z775-LP 80mm Sleeve Low Profile CPU Cooler]] fan, not only does the Rosewill fan have a lower profile, but it also is completely silent at idle and also while working in Photoshop, converting videos, and playing music CDs or blu-ray movies. The minimum noise level of the Rosewill is 16db, but I could not hear it at all. However, I could hear the \\\\\"15db\\\\\" SilverStone CPU fan. I had no overheating issues with either fan, probably because my CPU was the low powered Intel Core i3-2100. One more thing, the Rosewill RCX-Z775-LP fan is 1/2 the price of the SilverStone fan. If you need a low profile fan and need silence from your computer, get the Rosewill RCX-Z775-LP CPU fan.",

            "input": "Had an apple bluetooth keyboard of the same profile. Connected to my macbook pro quicker, stayed connected longer, and had a much better response to key inputs. As compared to the Anker keyboard. The anker keyboard routinely doesn't respond to key inputs, even when it is connected. Once you start typing and are doing so regularly it does a decent job keeping up, but still drops a key input every now and then. Keys also do not spring back up nearly as nicely as the old apple bluetooth keyboard. Overall I would not recommend anyone get this keyboard for serious work. It is simply not robust enough.<br /><br />UPDATE [3/3/14] (original post 1/29)<br /><br />Had the keyboard for less than three months now. Still having the issues stated in the original review -- keyboard disconnects after less than five minutes of inactivity from my macbook pro, takes ~15 seconds to reconnect every time; even when connected, if you weren't immediately typing the second beforehand, the first key input is dropped every time, regardless of the given key* and connected or not; keys do not spring back to default position as well as the macbook pro laptop keyboard or a dell desktop keyboard. Now I am experiencing a new regime of problems.<br /><br />Keyboard routinely disconnects every ten or so minutes. Doesn't matter what I am doing -- typing, idle. Tried replacing batteries and uninstalling and reinstalling software. (For example, in the middle of writing this paragraph the keyboard disconnected and took a solid minute to reconnect) This is in addition to all the times it simply disconnects when idle for a few minutes. As compared to when I first purchased to the keyboard, the lag times when connecting to the computer and first stroke key inputs actually making it to the computer have both increased at least two-fold.<br /><br />There was a moment when I suspected that maybe the connectivity issues were on my macbook pro's end -- the bluetooth receiver going bad or something like that. This entire time, however, I have been using an apple wireless bluetooth mouse without any issues. Sure, it disconnects after a few hours of inactivity, but otherwise it stays connected, responds immediately when nudged, and shows none of the other signs that the keyboard has.<br /><br />Disposing of the keyboard. It isn't worth the hassle. Not a good experience. Is there a keyboard out there of the same geometric profile and functionality as the apple brand wireless bluetooth keyboard, but with a less than 70 dollar price tag?<br /><br />*surprising to me, if you aren't doing work requiring a lot of typing, one can get used to this nuisance. The nuisance quickly grows into quite a hassle the more typing you start doing.",

I went to the Apple Store and asked the saleswoman if I could test both out. The Griffin does NOT work with the iPad 2, despite what it says on the Griffin site. The Compass works great with the iPad 2. Just keep in mind that what you're getting with this stand is a compromise between sturdiness and portability, but it's an EXCELLENT compromise. I'm a reporter, and I bought this to bring with me while covering conferences and conventions. I need it to prop the iPad up when I'm using a keyboard or showing photos/videos, and to hold the iPad when I'm typing or editing images/video. The Compass has already proven itself on one busy trip.<br /><br />The Compass comes with a carrying case that looks like it's meant to hold chopsticks--that's how small this thing folds up to. I store it in a pen pocket of my iPad carrying case. What surprised me most about this stand is how substantial it is: It's solid metal, with durable rubber padding where necessary, and the folding parts have a decent amount of resistance. The way that the supports fold away is brilliant; if it weren't so well built, this stand would be just a gimmick. It IS well-built, so it's a practical accessory.<br /><br />In display mode, you will need to hold the iPad with one hand while you press buttons. This is the case with most stands; if you think about it for a second, to make a stand that will let you type and swipe while the iPad is upright, the device would need to be solidly attached to the stand, and the stand would need to be either weighted down or attached to a surface, all resulting in something too big to put in a briefcase or purse. For a gadget that folds to the size of a pair of chopsticks, the Compass holds up rather well. The grooved rubber pads on the bottom part also help.<br /><br />In typing mode, I still have to be a little careful when pressing the Home button, or the iPad may slide. I do not recommend playing games with this stand, as any aggressive poking or swiping may dislodge the tablet. Comparison to Apple Smart Cover: I've had the Apple cover collapse more often and more easily when typing or attempting to do things on the iPad while in display mode; the Smart Cover does not do portrait mode. Compass wins as a stand.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solidly built<br />Compact for travel<br />Looks like something Blade would use to kill vampires<br />Good support for most uses outside of gaming<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not sturdy enough for gaming or angry emailing<br />May raise suspicion of astute airport screenersying games with this stand, as any aggressive poking or swiping may dislodge the tablet.

However, the leave-in receiver only lasted 20 days, really only 4 laptop bag insertions. I was pulling my laptop out of the bag at the airport today, and the black plastic housing popped off and disappeared. I took what was left of the receiver off and stowed it in the mouse hoping it would still work, but by the time I reinserted it the internal antenna had already been pulled free and it was dead. I also can't seem to find a way to buy a replacement for just the receiver.     I somewhat suspected this would happen, and a few times stowed the little thing in the mouse, but the whole idea of the tiny receiver was to leave it in, so I tired of pulling it off and stowing it every time. Ohh well.    I just ordered Logitech's bluetooth mouse instead as my laptop has built-in bluetooth. The battery life may not be as long as the M505, but since my M505 only lasted 20 days I don't think I'll mind.",

I learned this lesson well and can say that while I still think it's overpriced, it does do an order of magnitude better job than the knock-offs.<br />Biggest thing here is that the capacitive foam is properly attached and rounded while others are not. Next, and more importantly, is that pogo uses a little black rubber o-ring between the foam and the aluminum stick so that when you apply pressure and as the foam wears, you do not hit the screen with the metal shaft. The others do not have this feature and when you wear out the foam, you smack your glass screen with a sharp aluminum stick. That's what makes these guys better.<br />While this is not my first choice for writing (boxwave and alupen are) this is a great stylus for sketching and painting. The foam will wear down and change shape which scares you at first, but it in no way changes the quality of the product.

It does fit the Infinity, though tightly. I especially like the angles that the stand holds the tablet and I like that it's a very slim fit, not adding too much bulk or weight.  The cutouts for the ports and cameras fit fine. The little holes cutout for the speaker are about 1/2\\\\\" off, but this is a non-issue when the case is open as a stand in landscape mode, because the speaker area on the tablet is uncovered by the case at this time.

            "input": "After 1 month of ownership (as of tomorrow), I'm extremely impressed. However, I'm giving it four stars simply due to a few things that ASUS could easily change to make it even better.    First, before you consider buying one of these, you should realize what it's designed for. It's meant to be thin, light, and have extremely good battery life; it's NOT meant for extremely intensive tasks (video encoding, number crunching) or gaming. The machine is still very capable of everything I throw at it, and unlike netbooks you won't find yourself making compromises in every-day tasks to avoid slow downs.      Pros:  - GREAT battery life. I've seen about 6-8 hours on average, with 9-10 hours during very light use (and that's all on the moderate \\\\\"Entertainment\\\\\" battery setting). 12 hours may be achievable using the \\\\\"Battery Saver\\\\\" setting, which dims the display quite dark, throttles the processor even more, and reverts to the non-Aero Windows theme.    - Excellent size and weight. 13.3\\\\\" really is the sweet spot for me; it's very portable, and really seems significantly smaller than my previous 14.1\\\\\" laptop. This thing really seems as light as a feather compared to many other laptops. Too bad I just got out of college, I would have loved the \\\\\"lug\\\\\" things thing around.    - Decent build quality. The brushed aluminum cover is a very nice touch, and really makes the UL30A look very classy (though it would have been nice to see aluminum used on other panels as well). The screen is firmly hinged and it takes some force to make it wobble. Unlike other reviews I've read, the battery is locked in very securely by two locks, one on each side. There are a few small areas on the laptop casing that can be depressed, causing an audible click, but it takes a decent amount of force and the chassis seems to be very sturdy overall.    - Decent keyboard. The chiclet-style keyboard is a breeze to type on. Having the extra space between each key is very nice, especially when hunting for an unfamiliar key. There is some keyboard flex present, but it's much less pronounced that my previous laptop (ASUS N80Vn) and I generally don't find that it causes any problems with my typing speed (~90 WPM).     - LED Backlit Screen. After using one on my previous laptop, and now this one, I don't think I could stand to go back to a standard CCFL screen. The lighting seems much more even, and the colors are far more vibrant. I find that the screen causes less strain on my eyes over long periods of time, and even when I dim it to save battery life, it's still MUCH brighter than other laptops. With that said, the laptop most likely uses a cheaper TN panel (are there any laptops available with MVA/PVA/IPS panels?), so it may not be ideal for professional photo work.    - Great overall specs. Graphics card aside, you get a Core 2 Duo that sips power and is still capable of every day tasks, 4GB of memory, a 500GB hard drive, and Windows 7 Home Premium.    - Some multi-touch support on the track pad. Two-finger scrolling really beats a dedicated scroll bar once you get used to it, especially since it frees up more track pad real estate. The three-finger right click gesture is also nice. Why can't we have more?!      Cons:  - Intel Integrated Graphics. The X4500MHD (a.k.a. GMA 4500MHD) just plain sucks. It's more than plenty for basic desktop use, watching videos, and surfing the 'net. However, if you're looking to do any gaming, you should look elsewhere. For example, I read one review that stated they experienced stutters even playing World of Warcraft at a laughable 800x600 resolution. If you're not looking to do any gaming (or if the games you want to play are graphically simple, like Bejeweled, or over 5 years old, like Starcraft), the X4500MHD should do the trick. I REALLY wish the UL30Vt (user-switchable graphics between the X4500MHD and a Nvidia GT210M) was out when I purchased this one. If I had the opportunity to return mine and get the UL30Vt instead, I would in a heart beat.    - No Bluetooth. ASUS, really... it's 2009. Bluetooth is popping up everywhere. Sure, I can buy a tiny, cheap USB Bluetooth adapter, but that ties up one of the three USB ports on the machine. Ugh... this is probably the only thing about the laptop that really irks me. Integrated please.    - So-so track pad. The dimpled effect takes a little getting used to, but it's not horrible. I still prefer a smooth, recessed surface like traditional track pads, though. The available multi-touch gestures (mentioned above) are really nice, but I'd like to see more. I'm hoping more can be added with driver updates, and it's mot a hardware limitation. The biggest downfall to me is the buttons; they work fine, but they're a bit too stiff for my liking, and they emit a loud click when pressed. I use a wireless mouse (Logitech VX Nano - highly recommended) most of the time anyway, so it doesn't make much difference to me.    - Atheros Wireless card instead of an Intel card; lack of a gigabit network adapter (it's only 10/100), only 3 USB ports.      Overall, it's a a wonderful laptop for anyone looking for portability and battery life over raw performance. However, there are still a few things missing that would really make it a smash hit.",

I personally cannot hear the mic but my friends say I sound a lot more clear than my built-in-mic so that's always plus (be warned. there is a static feedback if you switch the mic on and off from the built-in-switch).

            "input": "I bought this machine almost 2 months back. I was looking at buying a lightweight and portable notebook. The notebooks from the more well known brands were quite expensive - typically $1700 plus. And then I saw this Averatec 3250HX-01 at CompUSA. I was impressed with the specs - and especially the 8O GB HDD and DVD burner.  <br /> <br />But the Athlon processor was a turn-off. I have always used the latest Intel processors in my machine and I just was not sure about the AMD Athlon processor. A lot of research led me to the conclusion that while the Athlon XP-M 2200+ processor may not rank with the best but it is more than adequate for the job. <br /> <br />Also, Averatec was a brand new to me. Had never heard of them before. They are a Korean company - part of a larger group. Checked with CompUSA, Circuit City, and OfficeMax (Best Buy did not carry the machine then) staff and I heard positive comments from them. <br /> <br />Bottomline, the machine had all the the specs I wanted but the one drawback was the Athlon processor. I'd have liked a stronger Intel processor. Although the brand was new but everybody had positive comments and at sub-$1000 this was the only lightweight and portable notebook I could get. So I bought it. <br /> <br />The machine has lived up to my expectations overall. I have only 3 issues with Averatec on this machine: <br /> <br />1. The 3 USB ports are placed on the right side of the machine. This is an awkward position - which means that my DSL wire crawls all over my table and my wireless mouse stick sticks out outwardly and I have to take care not to hit it when moving the mouse. Also since the USB ports are so close together I cannot use the third port (usually the middle one) when the other two are being used. I have to buy a USB hub. <br /> <br />2. The battery lasts for around 2 hours. Could have done with a longer lasting battery. <br /> <br />3. Beyond 1 hour of usage the machine gets warm, beyond 2 hours it gets hot. And beyond three hours it is very hot at the bottom. Although, the top part gets only mild warm at the hottest of times. I have now used it for as much as 8-10 hours continously a few times, and have had no problems in response times. But I believe its best not to get too hot - so I'm now limiting my conitnous usage to not more than 3 hours. <br />  <br /> <br />The software that comes with the machine is OK - although I have not used it much. I am using other software which I have installed on this machine. <br /> <br />The after-sales support is OK. But I am basing this on just one experience. I got thru to the representative after 5 minutes of wait and he was able to guide me. <br /> <br />My net take is this. Buy this machine if you are working on a tight budget and want good specs in a 12.1\\\\\" machine. Brand conscious people need to look elsewhere. <br />",

I purchased this model becuase another reviewer noted that this adapter allowed audio to be streamed through the minidisplay port. Unfortunately, I did not do enough research to discover that the early 2009 iMac did not have a graphics card that supported audio-out through the minidisplay port (at least not for my base 24\\\\\" model).     I also purchased a 25' long HDMI-to-HDMI cord, and the picture that came across on my 720P Vizio TV was fine. It looked like at least as good as DVD quality, although perhaps not quite as sharp as Blu Ray (if my uncalibrated eyeballs can actually tell the difference).    I can not attest to its ability to stream audio.    I think this adapter may work well for folks with late 2009 iMacs and newer. The build quality of this adapter is such that I wouldn't want to swap it out constantly because it does feel a bit like cheap plastic, so I don't know eactly how durable it would be.

This 43302AU model has a faster 2nd generation i3 processor. Most laptops being sold now with an i3 now have the 3rd generation i3 CPU. This must be a leftover model.<br /><br />THIS LENOVO *ALSO* CAME WITH A BROKEN WIFI ADAPTER. This is certainly not this vendor's fault. Both models came with a 320GB Caviar Blue 5400 rpm hard drive. WD is probably the most reliable hard drive manufacturer, or at least tied at top place with Toshiba hard drives, so I consider the first laptop's hard drive failure as just an infrequent fluke.<br /><br />Instead of sending the whole laptop back to its vendor *again*, I called up Lenovo customer support and got them to send me a box with free shipping to send just the wifi adapter back for a free replacement. The wifi adapter card measures 1.5 inches by 1 inch. Lenovo sent me a 22 inch by 15 inch laptop shipping box !  It barely fit into the FedEx mailbox. An alternative would be to give Lenovo an 80 dollar loan paying no interest for 6 to 12 weeks in order for them to first send me a 10 buck replacement wifi adapter. I would then send the broken adapter back to them and eventually get my money back.<br /><br />I bought a compatible Intel wifi adapter. It worked for about 2 hours and then failed in the same manner. (Win 7 networking said they were connected to the router, but no data would transfer.)

With the dual band I am able to get 300mbps speeds on an N only band.  The other band was for G and N and that worked well.  Then over time the router began to fail.  The wireless doesn't work and when it does there is huge fluctuations over time with the speed.  Every night I have to reboot the router at least once.  Fortunately I can do it remotely from my upstairs laptop.  I know it is the router because re-booting just the router almost always solves the connection problem. So it is not my modem or my provider (Comcast).  In addition every few days I get the message \\\\\"You have set the wrong dynamic or static IP address for your RT-N56U\\\\\".  When you search on the web for the cause and solution for this error you find scores of threads about it and how there is nothing much you can do about it except reboot the router.  I have the firmware up to date but that doesn't help.  I am considering using third party firmware which some people say fixed the problem.  I am hesitant to use 3rd party software but the router is essentially worthless.  It went from being the best router I ever had to the worst over the course of a few months.  This seems to be a very common issue with this modem as seen in the hundreds of postings online.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />I am now in the process of looking for another dual band router to replace this one.  I will probably buy a different one and before I open it up and install it, I will try the 3rd party firmware with the Asus and see if that keeps the router stable and up and running.<br /><br />Also, while the design of the router is very cool it is somewhat impractical.  With the wires attached it is unstable on the stand and it is very difficult to wall mount.  Plus when the remote re-boot doesn't work I have to walk down 3 flights of stairs to my family room and un-plug and re-plug the router power to cold boot it so I need to be able to get to the power cord.<br /><br />I would avoid this router if you can.  You may be like the 5 star people and have absolutely no problems.  Or you can be like me...a big fan for several months and now...it is a pain the neck.  I have a straight vanilla setup.  Comast is the provider.  I have a top end Motorola modem of my own.  I do nothing fancy.  Good luck to everyone who owns one.

The difference in the sound blew my mind: So much richer, deeper, more full in both lows and highs.

You can only use the card within windows or Linux, just not be able to boot from any drive plugged into this card's ports.

Works great out of the box with Apple products (macbook pro).<br /><br />I bought and returned a few monitors before finding this one.  Initially I bought the Dell S2440L at my local best buy.  It was a hasty decision, and I did it in part because I was desperate for a temporary monitor.  The s2440l had bad colors, poor black levels, and a bad glossy screen.  The base also felt very wobbly and cheap.  For some reason, the I could really notice the pixels too.  I knew I needed an upgrade.<br /><br />Since I saw pixelation in the 1080p Dell, I thought I wanted more pixels.  I thought this was reasonable since I was use to the retina screen anyway.  I jumped up a notch and bought the 4k Samsung U28D590D.  The colors where more vibrant, the blacks where much deeper, and it was fun having the 4k experience.  It was also nice stepping up into a 28inch monitor, but after a while, I knew it was a bit much.  The primary reason for returning the u28d590d was because of an area of the screen which had a a strong green discoloration.  It was especially noticeable on darker scenes.  There was no way I was going to keep a $600 monitor that wasn't perfect.  It also wasn't adjustable, or VESA mount compatible.<br /><br />After seeing what 4k felt like, I didn't think a higher res was worth it.  Sure I couldn't see the pixels, but it wasn't worth it at all.  So I decided instead of a low grade 4k monitor, I should get a nice 1080p monitor with the features I want.  I bought both the Dell u2412m and u2414h.  I had read online that some people actually preferred the screen on the older u2412m.  I didn't want to wonder, so I bought them both anticipating I would return the lesser one.<br /><br />Both monitors have a solid, fully adjustable stand.  In fact, both where much much nicer than the more expensive Samsung.<br /><br />The newer u2414h is better overall.  Its colors also resemble those of Apple's monitors, which was important tome.  One thing I noticed about all the other monitors was the whites where much warmer than Apple's white.  I like the way Apple monitors are calibrated, and this Dell u2412h was very similar (after some small adjustments of course).  I actually bought a second one, so now I have a nice dual monitor set-up.<br /><br />The Dell u2414h also comes with a minidisplay port to displayport 1.2 cord, so it is directly plug and play the MacBook Pros.  I actually needed to buy an adapter for the older u2412m.  If you have a MacBook Pro and want a monitor, get this one!  Make sure to go into your Display settings, Color Management, and change the input to Apple RGB if you want a matching set up.",

Multi-gesture touchpad, 4GB memory, HDMI output, 320GB hard drive, LED backlight display. I wish all this had been available four years ago!

But more annoying than that is the fact that the Link Light blinks constantly when you are connected to a router.  Even if you are not on the internet, not doing anything at all, the link light will blink, forever.<br /><br />So here is my suggestion to Motorola, seal the lights so they only shine out the front where they are supposed to, reduce the brightness by about half on the Blue LED's, and do something about forever blinking Link light.  It doesn't need to blink just being connected to the router.  If there is not activity it should not blink.  If this sounds picky, it is, but not unreasonable.",

I have Win XP on both computers.<br />I could not get the remote (wireless) computer to connect to the internet through the router. The local (hardwired) computer worked just fine through the new router. The remote computer's &quot;Netgear proprietary&quot; status display showed the connection was fine. However I couldn't even ping the router from the remote computer. After trying different PCI slots, de-installing and reinstalling the Netgear software and drivers, and everything else you could think of, I finally found the problem!<br />The Netgear status display software was screwing up the connection. Their own software, and they can't get it right. So, DO NOT USE the Netgear status display software from the CD that comes with your wireless adapter! If you do the normal installation from the CD, you will automatically get this bad software installed on your computer. So don't install straight from the Netgear install window that pops-up when you insert the CD.<br />If you already installed it, go to &quot;remove program&quot; and delete it. Take the CD out of the reader. Restart the computer. Let  Windows sense the device and pop-up the &quot;install new hardware&quot; wizard. Now insert the CD and point the wizard to the CDROM to get the drivers. <br />Now you have the correct drivers, without the problematic NETGEAR status display. Good luck.

On one hand, it does the job as advertised; on my Kindle Fire HD, it definitely charges faster then using a USB cable connected to my computer, and it seems to charge faster then using other USB chargers that I have from other devices such as my cell phone by a few hours.  In that regard, it works just fine.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, it's also an annoyance that Amazon didn't elect to angle the adapter or have the USB port face to the side opposed to the bottom, as it can block some other outlets on your surge protector or power strip depending on how the outlets are oriented.<br /><br />The big problem is that I don't like the idea that Amazon is charging $20 for a charger when it should be something that comes standard with the Kindle Fire or Fire HD.  I know Amazon is trying to keep costs low, but given that this sort of basic power adapter is included in all other devices I have that charge via USB, it's quite an annoyance.  Yes you can wait for it to charge via USB on a computer, and yes a lot of people have other Micro USB charging devices laying around, but customers really shouldn't have to pay extra for it, even if Amazon has put it on sale for $10 regularly.<br /><br />3 stars because it works, but it could have been a lot better designed and cheaper for Kindle owners to pick up.",

I suspect I will have to get another style of case entirely, but this one's design would have been perfect, except that it broke in 3 weeks.<br /><br />This thing was babied, carried inside neoprene case which in turn was inside foam padded tablet sleeve in a brief case. Until it failed, I really liked the case in almost every way. I got same case for my wife at same time. Hers is even more babied than mine in that she never took it out of the apt. Hers is starting to show stress cracks on the same corners. We think these are caused by once daily removal of the tablet from the case.  At first it was a bit difficult to remove tab from case.",

I put this into an early 2011 2.7 i7 macbook pro with 16gb of ram. It installed fine with no major issues, 6gbps on SATA III. Upon installation, i ran a Blackmagic Benchmark to find i was consistently getting 80mb write and 125mb read speed. Very slow for an SSD touting 450 and 450 (these are written on the package). I had trim enabler running on my SSD.<br /><br />I did some research and found that kingston moved from a previous NAND chipset provider to an outsourced and cheaper version, and patched the fix with a 5.06 firmware update, effectively cutting the performance of the drive in half. I decided at that point to keep the drive, since it was much faster than my stock 5400rpm drive, and would purchase a better SSD later.<br /><br />2 months pass, and my SSD is failing. Kingston knows about it, and has yet to modify their drives. Amazon offered me a refund, which i happily took. The only commendable company in this whole ordeal is Amazon.<br /><br />Long story short, steer very clear of this SSD unless you aren't booting from it. It won't give you good speed unless you positively get a drive with the faster NAND and the 5.05 firmware. Would not buy again. I returned it and bought a crucial m500",

Well, I'd say that cooler is great if you don't plan to overclock.  On my i5-2500K, I took it from stock 3.3 GHz to 4.7 GHz and my temps were pushing 90C on the Hyper 212+ on full load under Prime95.  Much too high!    I installed the Noctua NH-D14, and my temps immediately dropped to a max of 70C under full load.  That's a 20C difference!  This was using the included ULN (ultra low noise) adapter, which decreases fan speed to make the fans more quiet.  Even with the reduction in speed, cooling was more than adequate.    The unit is of very high quality, instructions are flawless (if you need them), and installed in about 10 minutes.  I will say the heatsink is huge, so definitely make sure it will fit your motherboard, case, and clear your RAM.  Noctua has a compatibility list on their website.  Once it's installed, it really feels rock solid on there.  I have no worries it's going to break my motherboard.  With the Hyper 212+, the heatsink isn't even secure completely once it's on there, because it swivels left and right.  Apparently this is part of the design, and normal, but I didn't like it.  The Noctua is clearly a much more sophisticated design.    I'm only comparing to Hyper 212+ because that's a value cooler that people really like, and I personally experienced.  The Noctua NH-D14 is overkill if you're not going to overclock, but if you're seeking high overclocks, you want it.  It's well worth the price.    Highly recommended!",

I use to roll my eyes when people complained about that kind of thing- not any more!  Holy cow, I couldn't do anything with my right hand (holding a fork, turning the car on, etc.).  Since using this keyboard at work (and similar 4000 at home) for a couple years I have little or no issues with pain any longer.  Don't remember the last time my wrist hurt at all.  That is the primary consideration for me.  I am not super picky about minor details.    I also get an occasional \\\\\"delay\\\\\" as I type fast.  I don't know if it is the wireless (interference perhaps) or just the drivers (PC is busy for a moment).  Not really a problem- it catches up in a few seconds.  I also have used the keyboard for many months, and have found it easy to adjust to.  The mouse was a little harder to adjust to but worth the effort (just remember to move you arm and not your wrist for best results- it's not that hard).  I type by touch 95%.  Expect it to seem odd at first, but really after a few days or weeks it will probably become \\\\\"preferred\\\\\". Other non-ergo keyboards seem tiny and cramped when I have to use them.    -------------->>> I have one suggestion for everyone with this keyboard.  Get some CLEAR nail polish.  Cover your key labels.  The one drawback for this keyboard for me is the most-used letters rub off in the first six months to a year or so.  Clean the keyboard well, then put the nail polish on as a clear protective shield over the keys.  A second coat the next day will help.  Let it dry at least an hour.  You will have to refresh that maybe every 4-6 months for best results.  Well, try it on one key first and make sure it dries well before using it.  Then you can see if it changes the feel for you.  I had to find a silver metallic paint-pen (fabric store) to re-label a couple keys.  [Elmer's Painters Metallic Opaque Paint Marker].  Get all the keys you use- arrows, etc. are easy to overlook until they are blank!  I read other comments where people report calling Microsoft to complain or comment and they are told basically \\\\\"tough, buy a new one\\\\\".  At $50+ I don't think so.  As this is an EASY workaround I won't downgrade the product review, but I am not happy with MS on it.",

In 1997 an ad was run with actor Richard Dreyfuss reading the voiceover, which began with: \\\\\"Here's to the Crazy Ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.\\\\\" Think Different... that was the 1997 slogan and theme for Apple's comeback to the world of serious computing after the return of Steve Jobs, and perhaps it was a cynical reference to IBM's famous \\\\\"Think\\\\\" slogan.  Whatever it was, this was the ad campaign that restored Apple's reputation under the leadership of the late Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Take this [[ASIN:B005CWIVYI MacBook Pro]] review as one from a dedicated Windows PC user who made the switch awhile ago, with time enough to put it through its paces, to do side-by-side comparisons.  I've owned a Mac before, back in the day of the Macintosh SE, and though I found it to be extremely useful for desktop publishing in the days when Aldus PageMaker reigned supreme in that area, I saw things blend as Microsoft slowly got its act together, for the most part.  When it came time to upgrade back then, I stuck with the Windows PCs... until recently, when I found the need to diversify a bit.<br /><br />To make this easy for those who just want to get to the facts quickly, I'll list the positive and negative points that I've personally found with the MacBook Pro first, then elaborate with details a bit further on.  Please also remember that these are coming from a satisfied Windows 7 PC user, and one with multiple computers.<br /><br />\u25c6 MacBook Pro Positives:<br /><br />+ Well thought-out packaging, easy out of the box setup<br />+ Excellent build quality, unparalleled detail in workmanship<br />+ Superb aluminum unibody chassis construction, has a good solid feel<br />+ Sharp 13.3-Inch backlit display, first-rate 1280-by-800 Resolution<br />+ Screen display has excellent color resolution and contrast for photos<br />+ First class backlit keyboard, easy to use in low-light situations<br />+ Very fast boot up even with password protection enabled<br />+ Proven Mac OS X operating system; based on UNIX (like a server)<br />+ Built-in SD card slot; great for transferring photos to computer<br />+ Responsive ergonomic multi-touch trackpad; no buttons, excellent cursor control<br />+ Well-engineered 60W power adapter with decent cable management system<br />+ Automated incremental backups with Time Machine, works with almost any external HDD<br /><br />\u25c6 In Between:<br /><br />\u00b1 Claimed 7 hour battery life; 5-6 hours is more like it, depending on the apps that you're running<br /><br />\u25c6 Negatives:<br /><br />- No built-in HDMI or VGA output, adapters must be purchased separately<br />- Only 2 USB 2.0 ports, and they are too close together<br /><br />\u25c6 The Details:<br /><br />We each have our reasons for the computers that we own.  Mine were primarily to have a compact yet sturdy platform for word processing, accessing the Internet, and digital photo processing.  That stated, there's little to not like about this MacBook Pro.  The Intel Dual-Core Processor is fast and efficient, and even better than the Pentium Dual-Core 2.20GHz processor on my Windows 7 notebook PC.  It's one thing to see it in the store, but when one gets it home and takes it out of the well-designed box, it's apparent that this is a better grade computer than might have been anticipated.  The first thing that is noticed once it's unwrapped is the workmanship.  The unibody main enclosure, constructed from a single block of aluminum, is proof of this attention to detail and it helps add to its durability.<br /><br />The 13-inch backlit LCD display is sharp, and has the excellent color resolution and contrast that I need, especially when working with photos.  The glossy screen actually helps to see images with their full clarity.  Using both Adobe software apps and Nikon Capture NX 2, having clear and sharp resolution is an absolute necessity, and this MacBook Pro offers that.  The backlit keyboard is a pleasure to use, and quite functional in low-light mobile locations.  I'm also very impressed with the quick boot up, even with the password startup screen enabled, a security necessity when at some mobile locations.<br /><br />It's hard to fault OS X in any way.  This operating system is UNIX-based, and therein lays its strength, along with its ability to run 64-bit applications.  It works right out of the box without fiddling or tweaking.  It's far better than Mac OS 9 and its predecessors, and the security while on the `Net is reassuring.<br /><br />The tiny built-in SD card slot has proven itself to be good for transferring photos from the digital cameras to the computer.  I've also used it to transfer other media files and documents between computers in a pinch.  It took awhile to get used to the trackpad, with its so-called \\\\\"multi-touch gestures,\\\\\" but once mastered it's easy to use.  Must admit that I do revert to using a mouse when using the computer at home... call it years of conditioning.<br /><br />This computer really shines with the inclusion of the Time Machine application, and I was happy to find that I could use a reasonable priced off-the-shelf hard drive to do automated incremental backups.  I have a [[ASIN:B005J7YAWI Toshiba 500 GB USB Portable Hard Drive]], and all I did was reformat it to HFS+ Journaled file system to use the Time Machine backup software.  It works like a champ.<br /><br />The external 60W power adapter is well engineered and keeps my computer running cooler than PC notebooks with internal power supplies.  I appreciate the magnetic DC connector as it pops off easily if some klutz trips on the cord, necessitating a costly repair as I found out when someone did that to one of my PC notebooks.  The LED in the connector head helps: amber it's charging, green it's charged; very simple and effective.<br /><br />\u25c6 Other Notes:<br /><br />The battery life being less than advertised I can live with.  I would have expected HDMI and/or VGA output to be built-ins with a computer of this quality.  But I have yet to buy the adapters.  But to have only two built-in USB 2.0 ports is irritating, and those are too close together.  Problem solved with an external 4-port ISB adapter, so that issue is closed.<br /><br />I have had issues with laptop carrying bags in the past, and now carry my MacBook Pro in a [[ASIN:B0016LNJXM ThinkTank Artificial Intelligence 15 V. 2.0 Laptop Bag]].  I picked this one over many others from heavy experience with photo gear, and know that Think Tank makes exceptionally good pro gear.  It protects my computer from the elements quite well, holds more gear than I can explain here (I have reviewed it), and can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their MacBook with the kind of case that it really deserves.<br /><br />Browser note: I've used the included Safari browser, but my de-facto standard remains Google Chrome.  Safari is a decent browser, but because I find it necessary to synchronize my email on the Mac, the PCs and even one older Linux-based notebook (it's a geek/support thing), Chromes just works better, and I find it faster.  Your experiences may differ, so try whichever works for you.<br /><br />I'm running [[ASIN:B003YCOJB2 Office for Mac 2011]] and have found its interface to be even better than Microsoft Office 2010 or 2007 on the PC.  Didn't know if the implementation of Outlook for Mac 2011 would be better than Entourage, which was buggy, but Outlook turned out to be excellent, and it's become my mainstay over the PC version.<br /><br />Heat is an issue that I had heard of by some, yet I have not experienced.  The heat level is better than my old HP, Compaq or Dell, and far better than my VAIO (which was very bad).  The only one that has been better heat-wise is my current ASUS notebook running Windows 7, but not by much.  Had been tempted to get a keyboard skin for general protection in the field, but heard that these interfere with the ventilation, so that idea has been tabled for the present.<br /><br />\u25c6 Future:<br /><br />I may upgrade to 8GB of RAM, which has been recommended by a number of people if and when system performance issues arise.  The RAM upgrades are quite reasonable, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it runs with the standard 4 GB at this point.<br /><br />\u25c6 [Updated 3/10/2014]<br /><br />This MacBook Pro has been in continuous use for over two years now. In the summer of 2012 I did the memory upgrade to 8GB of RAM using the [[ASIN:B001MX5YWI Crucial 8GB (4GBx2) Kit]] in anticipation of the OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) release.

After much troubleshooting where the Xbox  network adaptor (MN-740) would drop the network connection as soon as I attached the XBOX itself to the network adaptor, I realized that the reason this was happening was the MAC address filtering.  In order to have the network adaptor actually join itself to the network, you need to add BOTH the MAC for the adaptor itself AND the MAC for the XBOX into the MAC address filtering ALLOW table for the Linksys access point.<br />I believe that this may solve other issues that people are having with attaching multiple devices to through wireless to these WAPs.<br />I was very surprised that this information was not documented.  It should be stated in the user's manual that if you are using MAC filtering, that you need to add all MAC addresses of all units that are bridged into the WAP into the ALLOW table of the MAC filter.<br />Right now I'm working fine with MAC filtering enabled and 128bit WEP turned ON as well.  FYI - with these Linksys units throughput goes from 54mbps to 18 when 128bit WEP is turned ON.  Must be due to the cheap CPUs in these units.<br />The speed drop when WEP is enabled plus the lack of MAC filter documentation keeps this from being a five star review.",

Its pretty nice to order an item online and have it the next day. The first day I was able to sit down and use the tablet was that Friday. From the very first time I used it I had problems with the screen registering a touch when I was not touching it. The problem got progressively worse the more I used it, until Saturday when I decided to call ASUS technical support. The guy on the phone was as helpful as he could be, but the cold reboot and the factory reset that he had me do did not fix the issue. At that point he told me I need to send it in for repair and possible replacement to ASUS. But ASUS requires you to send the tablet back to them so the can inspect it before they will send you the repaired item or a replacement. Knowing that most people would be upset having to go without their brand new tablet for at least a week he suggested that I try and return to Amazon as they are much faster sending out replacements. Within 5 minutes Amazon had a replacement item ordered with free 1 day shipping. Also you do not have to send back the faulty device  before they send the replacement. Once you receive your new device you send the bad on back in the same box. Although it is upsetting to spend upwards of $500 on a tablet that I have literally been waiting almost a year for, Amazon once again steps up the to the plate and makes the return and replacement process as quick and painless as you could possibly want. So for all you people trying to go through ASUS for a replacement just skip them and go straight to Amazon. A big thank you to customer service representative Angelica B for being so helpful and polite in my time of great need. And all you tech nerds know what I mean lol.<br /><br />And as much as I am impressed with Amazon and their customer service, I am just as impressed with this Tablet.Even with the screen issues straight out of the box, everything about this tablet blew me away. From the awesome HD screen to the screaming fast CPU to ICS preloaded, this thing is just an absolute pleasure to use. Cant wait to see this with Jelly Bean. I have heard people complain about the lack of 4g compared to the new Ipad, but once its connect to my Galaxy SIII's hotspot its just like being connected to WiFi. Got to love Verizon 4G LTE.",

First of all: I bought this for my 11 yr old because he is constantly dropping things and breaking them so I was looking for something durable (which is the ONLY good feature this thing has)! However there is no app store so he cannot download any games or movies he can only play the ones already on the device which he would find boring. It only has 2 age settings on it so I set it to ages 9 and up but there were a lot of preschool games on there such as Dora. Second: while trying to figure the thing out it kept on freezing on me so I was forced to shut the tablet down and turn it back on!<br />If I were you I would just buy a regular tablet and then buy a heavy duty case for it. I would also suggest buying a different brand like an iPad or a galaxy note. You know one that doesn't freeze up!",

The notebook's built in card picks up three networks in my neighborhood, but the Alfa USB adapter picks up eight! In tests with my own networks at home and work, the useful wifi range is extended considerably.    Unfortunately support is almost nonexistent. I sent an email to Alfa with a question and never received an answer. I also wanted to be sure I had the latest driver for MacOS and discovered the only driver available on the site was for Vista! What about all the others flavors of Windows?...Linux?...and the the Mac? (Alfa claims to support them all.)    After doing more research, I found that an apparently separate company, Realtek, actually writes the software, but I couldn't find any info on the Alfa USB adapter on their site either. This is all the pits.    Further research also shows that at least with the Mac, it's only possible to connect with networks that are either open, or using WEP security. Anything else is problematic. I could not, for example connect to my Airport Express using WPA, and others have reported similar problems.    Another major irritant: The included setup instructions are for Vista only. Again, what about all the other versions of Windows, Linux and the Mac? They are left to figuring things out on their own...    Fortunately for me, I only intend to use the Alfa when traveling and having to deal with weak open networks. For this purpose, the Alfa appears to work great.    Nonetheless, I am severely penalizing the rating because of the absolutely terrible support and terrible documentation. This is not a product for the casual user.

The entire review was written on the keyboard case, and I feel that I can type just as fast on this as any other keyboard.<br /><br />The Newtrent keyboard case came in an attractive package, so immediately I knew there was some level of thought and quality to the keyboard case. Upon opening, the keyboard and a USB to micro USB cable awaited inside.<br /><br />The keyboard case comes partially charged, but Newtrent recommends you charge it fully before using. Once done, my iPad 3 snapped easily into the case and the iPad feels sturdy inside its housing.<br /><br />I haven't used the keyboard case long enough to tell if the keys will mar the iPad screen in any way when the case is closed, but I plan on updating this review in a little while to report on long-term use.<br /><br />Pairing was easy as turning on the iPad's bluetooth and then holding down &#34;connect&#34; near the power button, located at the top of the keyboard. The power button is an on/off switch (which I prefer to &#34;auto connect&#34; types because I can then turn off the keyboard's power at will instead of relying on software to do it form me).<br /><br />To set the iPad up, you open the case and pull back on a sort of slider, which gives enough room for the iPad to rest in one of two notches. I wasn't a fan of this. Additionally, the little latch that keeps the iPad and the keyboard shut when closed was small and troublesome.<br /><br />Like most bluetooth keyboard cases, the function keys double as alternate abilities for the iPad such as a key for the home button, brightness keys, copy/paste keys, music playback control, volume and a lock key. The keyboard itself had nice travel despite the slightly smaller-than-standard keys (no fault of Newtrent\u2014all iPad keyboard cases need this because of the iPad's size).<br /><br />Some other miscellaneous notes: on the back, the silver attachment thingy was actually made out of metal, although it looked like plastic in the photos; the iPad can make this case top-heavy, but using the notch for the iPad closest to the keyboard alleviated that somewhat; charging seemed fast; the keyboard had a nice &#34;click&#34; to each keypress that I liked.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- Relatively lightweight<br />- Fast charge time<br />- Three indicator lights tell you what's going on with the case (charge, battery and pair)<br />- I like physical on/off switches, which this had<br />- Standard alternate function keys worked well and are beneficial<br />- Haven't had any pairing or disconnecting issues since I've been using it<br />- Key layout and size is good given the circumstances<br />- Nice tactile &#34;click&#34; with each keypress<br />- Silver thing on back turned out to be metal instead of plastic, so it's more solid than it looks<br />- iPad can swivel 360 degrees when not in &#34;keyboard typing&#34; mode<br />- iPad can be propped up into portrait mode while typing (although that's a bit less stable)<br />- Thinner than some of the other bluetooth keyboard cases I've seen, and it seems to protect the iPad well (I won't worry about taking this thing out and about<br />- Will most likely replace my magnetic cover/case + apple bluetooth keyboard combination I had been using previously<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- Not a fan of the slider on back to get the iPad into place<br />- Because of the slider on the back, the iPad has to be propped on one leg if you're using it on your lap<br />- Latch that keeps the iPad shut was small and flimsy<br /><br />Overall rating: A-",

I even read a review that said it had a smell to it, I get headaches VERY easily from foul scents and I smelt nothing. The rotation is handy and the little circle that twists from landscape to portrait also shows the apple on the rear of the iPad nicely...also you can slip your hand through that space and hold it much like an artist would hold a paint pallet. I was, at first, a little concerned if it would actually fit the IPad 3, it seemed, like maybe it could fall out of the hard plastic snap in area, however it does fit and hasn't come out yet and it is somewhat difficult to remove, so it's pretty snug in there and I don't think it can fallout.

I did not let the previous 1-star rating affect my decision to buy this card and I hope you will not either!<br /><br />I am connecting this card to a 1080p capable television (Sony KDL-40XBR6) which was manufactured in 2008, as my computer monitor.  I have had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS with this card.  I am giving it 5-stars because the card does exactly what it is supposed to and does so without any issues, and an excellent value at that.<br /><br />Physically, installation was a challenge routing wires around and over this beast. You must acknowledge the warnings when I say beast. According to the box allow 7.87\\\\\" x 12.6\\\\\" for installation space. When you open the box, the size of this card is breathtaking--especially for me since this is my first card on the higher end of the value range. Measure your case BEFORE you buy or you will be in for a world of stress. Especially ensure your cables are long enough to go around if they have to be stretched over or around and that drives or chassis parts will not contact this card after installation. If you want a quieter cooler rig, then this card will not disappoint.<br /><br />I only use this card for video, and web surfing--no gaming, but I am more than sure it is quite capable. The card also requires an extra 6-pin power (adapter included) to power it so please be sure you have a powerful enough power supply! The heat sink is so cool to the touch even at an ambient room-temp of 75F. The copper pipes faintly feel warm after running for several hours and even having FOUR 1080p videos scaled and simultaneously playing on my screen with no shutter or lag whatsoever.<br /><br />I am so happy with my video card and if you are even considering this card, then you will not be disappointed either.<br /><br />Some notes on installation: I was upgrading from an ASUS HD4350 to this cardto be ready for a descent experience when upgrading to Windows 8. I installed this card under a 32-bit Vista OS. On an alternate drive (SSD) I have the preview version of 64-bit Windows 8 and I have been switching between drives when I want to experiment or I need to work/play. I have had ZERO issues under either environment. In case you are wondering on the performance index under Vista I attain a 5.9 out of a possible 5.9. Under Windows 8 I attain a 7.3 out of a possible 9.9 which is truly respectable with respect to the value of this card. My old HD4350 only attained a 3.2 under Windows 8 for good reason--there are no supported Windows 8 drivers for the 4000 series--and there will not be according to a response I got from AMD.<br /><br />This is how I suggest you move from your old card to this one if you buy it and you will have minimal issues (this is how I installed mine):<br />1. download current drivers for your new video card for your current OS from the AMD website and save to your desktop<br />2. remove software under 'programs and features'-- Catalyst center or software driving your current card (may force restart at this point)<br />3. uninstall drivers for your current video card in the device manager; if the screen stays blank, that is fine just move to next step<br />4. do not restart but rather shutdown PC; you don't want your video card reinstalled after startup<br />5. swap/install your video card<br />6. reconnect and power-up -- windows generic drivers will get you going until you install the new catalyst software previously downloaded on your desktop<br />7. be amazed (if you are upgrading like me)<br /><br />Notice I opt to not use the software that is boxed with the card. I use AMD's software. Two reasons for this: 1)the software I downloaded is the most absolute current version driver; 2)AMD's Catalyst gives me all the control I will ever need over my card (including overclocking).<br /><br />Hope this review helps.

The cover is too stiff and doesn't lie flat, and every time it flexes a little, the iPad goes on or off. I tried bending it a bit to make it flatter, but no luck. I also have a Kensington keyboard/cover for my iPad Mini, but unfortunately it will not fit with only the Gripster back cover and stand, because the cover plastic wraps around the iPad where it would normally fit into the keyboard. In other words, I can use one or the other (minus the wrap) but not both.<br /><br />One solution (not a good one) is to turn off the Lock/Unlock feature that allows the magnetic cover to turn on/off the tablet and simply turn off/on the iPad manually. Instead of a wrap that has six magnetic sections, Native Union should have made it more like the Apple cover, with three sections. The larger magnets would stick to the surface better and avoid the problem of the two closest to the &#34;hinge&#34; refusing to lie flat. I'm hoping the cover will loosen up with use and eventually work as it is supposed to do.<br /><br />As with the full-size Gripster, the back cover and stand are very well made. The stand rotates and adjusts for any angle and holds the iPad exactly where and how you want it. The stand also acts as a handle, which I find extremely useful when a surface is unavailable to use the stand. I haven't tried other stands, so I don't know how they compare, but I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this product as I would the full-size Gripster.",

Aside from it blowing up within a foot of me, the only thing I can complain about was that it suffered from coil whine. At that point, I was still willing to trust Seasonic for further PSU purchases. I filed for an RMA and received the replacement within a week. Wow. I figured, Seasonic must really care about its customers. Wrong. The replacement I received was a dud as well. It seems to be suffering from internal electrical discharging (you can literally hear the discharges). Worst part about the experience (so far) is that, I believe it killed my motherboards audio during  one of its surges. My motherboard did give me a surge protection notice, but I have no way of proving it was due to the faulty PSU. Would they compensate me should it kill my next motherboard? Probably not.<br /><br />[Update]: Uploaded a video so you could hear the replacement unit I received. Seasonic was initially hesitant to take it back. They only offered another replacement because I kept complaining about it. Third unit was the one that toasted my video card.<br /><br />I've been trying to contact Seasonic for the past two weeks (through emails and through their automated online forms), but it's all getting rejected. People don't like filling RMAs for the products they buy (especially PC products) anymore than a company wants to fulfill their warranty claim. It's a weeks worth of downtime, and for every shipment, it's at least $10 (without insurance) to ship it. Take note: should the PSU get lost in the mail, they're not responsible. It'd be nice if they actually tested their refurbished PSUs before slapping an \\\\\"OK\\\\\" sticker on it and shipping it out to a customer that has already been let down the first time around. Bottom line Seasonic? If you're replacing a faulty product, make sure the replacement works.<br /><br />I'll post an update down the line, but for now, to me anyhow, Seasonic represents flaky products and flaky customer service.<br /><br />[Update]: PSU sparked on me again, melting the PCI-E cables connected to my video card and burning the connects on my video card as well. I complained to Seasonic that the video card has not been the same since the spark -- no real support. They asked me to ship the video card out to them, since they wouldn't cover the cost of repairing it through the original manufacturer. They cleaned out the burnt plastic from the PCI-E connectors and shipped the card back out. What a joke.<br /><br />The upside -- they sent me a new unit, but only after requesting and complaining over the last 3 units I've had. It wasn't a retail box unit -- just a new PSU with some extra cables tossed on the side.<br /><br />My advice? Go with another manufacturer, even if the PSU is made by Seasonic (such as Corsair, EVGA).nyhow, Seasonic represents flaky products and flaky customer service.<br /><br />[Update]: PSU sparked on me again, melting the PCI-E cables connected to my video card and burning the connects on my video card as well.

HOWEVER, this hub in combination with the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, specifically requires an extra cable to be fully functional. The Surface Pro 3 USB port does not supply significant power to USB devices, so this hub (having a AC adapter input) was a great solution to supplementing power to USB devices that have higher power requirements (SDD, DVD ROM, etc.).<br /><br />The problem is, this hub does not come with an AC adapter, nor did it come with any indication of which AC adapter is needed for it (no included manual, no indication on product page). PLUS, the AC adapter that is suggested on the Amazon product page is entirely incorrect and does not fit/work!!!!<br /><br />The vast majority of people are not familiar with AC adapter specs/sizes, so I purchased three AC adapters before successfully finding one that fit/worked. For anyone who's interested, it was this one:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003059FAI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />I plugged it right into the hub and plugged the USB end into the USB power slot on the power cord for my Surface. It immediately worked perfectly.<br /><br />Now, I have a fully functional, power-augmented USB 3.0 hub for my Surface that works flawlessly. I just wish I didn't have to waste $20 getting there... This would easily be a 5-star product if the power cable was included with the hub.<br /><br />Other than the power-cable issues, this hub is great. Four ports is more than enough for me, the speeds are right on, and it has worked perfectly with every device I've plugged into it.",

It's been awhile since I bought a video card (my last was a Geforce 8600GTS years ago) but if this is the new normal for volume on lower end video cards, I'm going to passive cooling or none at all. I'm assuming this was just a bad/defective stock fan. This card would blow away my old 8600 card in decibels. My use of this computer is going to be casual titles, and older classics on GOG.

The Black Cherry has linear (=non-tactile; pressure increases linearly as keys are pressed down) and mechanical characteristics; the latter means that the actuator is spring (not rubber dome).  SMK-88 is a rare model coming with such good parts in the compact body.    I found that SMK-88's look is identical to FILCO's FKB91JU (Japanese keyboard) that also uses Black Cherry switches except key arrangement, color, and FILCO's logo. Both models are made in Taiwan and I think by DSI.    The keytop is manufactured not to be slippery. The font being used is very similar to that of Apple keyboards. Black Cherry sound is not noisy like Blue Cherry's. As you learn you don't need to hit keys to the bottom, the key sound will become softer. Overall, it's nice.    For those not familiar with Cherry switches: The Black Cherry has a comfortable but little heavy feeling. Input is finished when keys are pressed to the mid point, but you'll never know it by key touch. You need to get used to it. If you keep hitting the keys to the bottom, your fingers will get tired. I think DSI's Modular Mac Keyboard KB-MODMAC-U is a good alternative. The Blue and Brown switches are available.  I recommend the Brown Switch model that should give you a lighter key touch (but not as light as the Blue Switch model) and a modest tactile feeling. When you pass the tactile point, input is done.",

            "input": "I gave this product a solid 4 stars, would have gone 4.5 if I could have, because of how well built it is and that it does as says. I wanted to write this review to give some future buyers this food for thought.<br /><br />Besides being mechanical, I loved, in principal, that there are no keys markings; it seemed more elegant and unique, in principal. but in practice, I struggled.<br /><br />I think this keyboard is very well made and works exactly as advertised. I used this on a macbook pro (yosemite) and windows 7 pro, and had no issues technically of any kind--truly plug and play. no drivers needed. And the hub worked great. The top case is very glossy (not sure if that was noted, but it was noteworthy to me), the keys are a 'normal' / muted finish.<br /><br />If you are a Mac user and reading this, you probably read about the recommendations to switch your option key, which was very helpful for me, but of course, not necessary. (just a preference thing). and coincidentally, one of the keys worked to pull up the mac dashboard, cannot remember which one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I decided I needed to return this. it improved my typing skills (since I could no longer cheat for the parentheses, asterisks, slash keys, etc.), but I had a hard time with passwords, to the point where I felt it would only get worse.<br /><br />Here is the &#34;food for thought&#34; part:<br />The tricky part for me with this keyboard was trusting when I create new passwords: am I typing what I think I am typing? When I create a new password, especially a complicated one, I like to look at the keyboard. As a workaround with the Das keyboard Model S, I found I needed the clipboard to create new passwords (typing the password to something like notepad then copying-pasting). But this became cumbersome and offputting for me, and could theoretically become a security issue as well.<br /><br />Also, I ordered the Cherry MX Blue. I love the feel and clicks of the blue, but it is very loud. Mostof you probably know what you are getting with a Blue, Brown, etc. But my advice would be to go find a store that has one before you buy it if you never have. For me, it is not that the MX Blue is loud, it is that it is very high-pitched, and annoyed me at times. I wonder if my neighbors can hear me typing. At night, when I typed on this, it did seem extra loud.<br /><br />Finally, the reason I don't give this keyboard a full 5 stars is the price. I think there should be some hotkeys of some kind - a volume mute or control of some kind for the $125+ price. A well made, simple mechanical keyboard feels more like a $75-90 purchase. Are we paying extra for no labels (something that surely saves the company money)? Again, there was nothing unexpected for me - Das Keyboard represents this keyboard very well. And supposedly made it well too - whatever gold keys are (?) It is a texas-based company I think, but my keyboard was made overseas somewhere in Asia.<br /><br />I have already ordered the Das Keyboard 4 as a replacement. It seems to have more of what I want in a keyboard, and I ordered brown. If I had not been impressed with this keyboard, I would not have ordered another Das product.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are aware of the cherry mx blue high-pitched clicking and truly ok with no labels, and want something unique, then ignore my comments, and I am sure you will be happy.",

In no special order they are:  Placement of the on/off button is bad, you do inadvertently turn it on and off when you don't want to.  The overall feel is just not quite right for me.  The screen was slow to respond.  The library organization is cumbersome when you get a large number of books in your library.  Software interface also has an \\\\\"unfinished\\\\\" feel to it.  Not very intuitive.  Finding your way around is just not straightforward.  The Kindle also does not come with the ability to expand storage memory.  The two major issues with it had to do with paging through my library.  When I was creating a grouping of books the Kindle would freeze some place in the library and it was definitely frozen.  I waited for a long time to see if it would recover but it never did.  Hard reset to start all over.  The second was at times I would touch the screen to execute a command, wait, then touch it again to try it again, then wait, then try another command to get out of where I was, then wait, then all at once about 5 to 10 seconds later the sequence of commands I had apparently entered were executed in the order I had entered them.  Hiccup.<br /><br />I suppose I could have tried to work around some of these minor issues and get used to them, adjust my habits, but I thought there might be a better option.  The Nook.  I have to say that after switching to the nook I have had none of these bad experiences.  It has been working well and except for a couple of \\\\\"training\\\\\" oversights in the manual I eventually found out all I needed to know through some internet searches to make the nook do everything I expected or wanted to do.  The storage memory can also be expanded with a micro SD card.  Easy to do but not present in the Kindle Touch.  I also like the fact that you can customize the screen saver on the Nook Touch. Small touch, but nice.  Also, contrary to the Kindle the Nook tells you the percent of battery life left instead of a coarse icon indicator like in the Kindle.  Software interface is simple and intuitive for the most part and for the little issues you may have to start with once your find out how to do something it makes some sense.  Again, small differences but to me it shows more careful thought and better software.  Sure, the Nook Touch could be improved, like the procedure for checking out books from the library, but nothing really significant.<br /><br />Summary/Comments:  The Kindle Touch seems to have been rushed out to production with a poor software package installed that could account for most of my issues.  The nook itself is much nicer from a hardware and form factor standpoint, buttons in nice places, no accidental button hits, with a better touch and feel, and better, easier to use software.<br /><br />If Amazon comes out with a significant software upgrade to the Kindle Touch it would probably fix \\\\\"most\\\\\" of the issues and it would approach being competitive with the Nook.  Still, there are some form factors and feel that make them different that software could not fix.",

I've had some trouble with my wrist using touch-pads, mice and trackballs.      The Good:  This device has a standard optical mouse mode, as well as the presentation mode.  It has 5 buttons and the ability to use the trackball to move the cursor while presenting.  Most presentation mice are designed for running PowerPoint presentations, but this device can be used as a primary pointing device.  It also has a laser pointer built in.  I haven't had any issues with battery life, although I don't use it for extended periods of time.  It also comes with a nice carrying case for the mouse, optional USB charger, and USB transmitter.    The Bad:  The trackball sensitivity can't be adjusted, and it lacks accuracy.  the ball itself doesn't move as smoothly as I would like, and it makes it difficult to point and click on certain things.  The buttons are limited in their programing.  There are preselected lists of options for each button and it is not as customizable as I would like.  Also, while trying to use this as a mouse replacement, I found it cumbersome to pick up and put down the mouse whenever I needed to type, so I still use the touchpad or a trackball as well (although this is specific to my attempts to replace my pointing device).    Overall this mouse has the most functionality of any mouse at this price.  If you can deal with the limitations of trackball accuracy and button programing, you'll probably like it.",

The problem has only just set in with the release of the iPad. Obviously the the price gap is over $250 dollars (and I'm sure the Kindle will become even more affordable in the near future), but that extra cost buys you a device with many upgrades, including the Amazon Kindle iPad app. The Kindle still has the advantage of the E-ink screen and free Whispernet access, but the iPad offers so much more that now you really have to sit down and think things through before you buy a new reading device.<br /><br />The Kindle though is about one thing really-reading. And it does that very well. There are some formatting issues with books that have graphics or tables in them. You will find there are time when the wireless simply will not connect. It feels somewhat fragile, as though holding it the wrong way could crack the plastic front. And you are going to see new release prices going up, not down.

Effectively connected my computer (PC laptop with Windows XP) to an amplifier (connected to speakers) and played everything from the laptop (Pandora, Windows Media, youtube), no software or configuration required. Several months ago, I decided I wanted to have decent spealers to play music from my laptop after bad experiences with small ones ([[ASIN:B000ZH98LU Logitech S150 USB Speakers with Digital Sound]] are weak and sound terrible). I am a complete audio dummy (didn't know what an amp was before buying speakers and reading in the manual that they need to be connected to one). This review is what I learned, hopefully it will help some other dummy. My setup is as follows:<br /><br />Speakers: [[ASIN:B000OG6I6A Sony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers with 8\\\\\" Woofer (Pair)]] - they are huge, but attractive. The built-in 8\\\\\" woofer technically qualifies as a subwoofer; the sound is good enough that I don't feel a separate subwoofer (a large-diameter speaker that generates bass/low frequency sound) is necessary. These are passive speakers, they don't even have a power plug, and come with only thin wires that have to be connected to a receiver or amplifier.<br /><br />Amplifier: [[ASIN:B0013CDZDI Pyle PTA2 Mini 2x40W Stereo Power Amplifier]] - an amplifier is connected to an audio source on one end and to speakers on the other end. Most amps are large and heavy; this one is the cutest thing you ever saw. It's small and compact, the size of half a sheet of paper, fitting easily on top of one of the B3000 speakers. The wattage determines how high the volume can be turned out without degrading sound quality. 40W is more than sufficient for home entertainment. I haven't yet turned it up more than 25% of the volume up, and I like listening to loud obnoxious rap music. I chose PTA2 over RCA2 model because PTA2 had more than one audio input, which might come in handy, and according to other reviews, the input plugs are more standard and don't require buying additional connectors. Also, it says it's meant for 4-ohm speakers, while Sony B3000 are 8-ohm speakers, it works just fine anyway.<br /><br />Wireless audio transmitter/receiver: [[ASIN:B002BDU95A Creative Labs Sound Blaster Wireless Audio Transmitter and Receiver Bundle]] - the box says \\\\\"for iTunes\\\\\" and that kept me from buying it for a few weeks, but it indeed works for everything that I play on my computer from hulu to Windows Media.<br /><br />This is all I needed.

Connected the Sony speakers to the Pyle amplifier using the thin wires that came with the speakers, matching + to + and - to -, and connected the amp to the power outlet.<br /><br />2. Connected the Creative Labs receiver (tiny and cute! fits easily on top of the Pyle mini-amp) to a power outlet, and to the amplifier using the provided connectors. The one-ended prong went to the receiver (hole labeled Line Out) and the two-sided prong to the amplifier under AUX2 (matching red-to-red and white-to-black. Made sure the knob on the front of the amp was turned to AUX2.<br /><br />3. Plugged the UBS stick (Creative Labs transmitter) into my laptop.<br /><br />4. Opened a new brower and went to Pandora.

I was looking for a backup AC adapter and was concerned about getting one that, like the factory version, has an internal ID chip that tells the laptop it is an \\\\\"approved\\\\\" charger. Without the ID chip, an AC adpater will run a Dell laptop but not charge the battery so long as you have the factory Dell software loaded that is used to manage various functions like docking.<br /><br />After reading the positive reviews, I decided to take a gamble on this Anker AC adapter. I'm happy to say it does indeed function just like my factory charger. This unit will run my laptop and also charge the battery. I verified this using the Windows battery/power monitor function. I also verified it works when plugged into my Dell Pro1X docking station.<br /><br />As far as heat dissipation goes, both are similar. I used a Raytek MiniTemp gun to measure how hot both got. Under various conditions, both run in the 100F to 110F degree range.<br /><br />From a distance, the Anker charger looks very similar to the factory Dell charger. The biggest functional difference is the Anker doesn't have the handy rubber strap used by the Dell version to secure the cords when they are wrapped around the plastic body (the rubber strap is attached to the body of the charger so you can't lose it). Instead Anker went with some velcro straps - usable but not as handy as Dell's rubber strap.<br /><br />Weight-wise with cords, the Anker weighs 13.5 ozs while the Dell weighs 18 ozs. The total lengths of both AC adpaters are nearly the same.<br /><br />As far as longevity, the Dell charger has been working for almost 4 years now. I only recently got the Anker (fast shipping!) so the jury is still out, but at least it comes with an 18-month warranty. More importantly, the feedback here indicates Anker is honoring warranty returns.<br /><br />In summary, this Anker AC adapter functions just like my factory charger from Dell.",

The batteries in the mouse last between 3-5 days, so we have two sets that we trade off with.<br /><br />I take off one star because there are some software issues that can require (after a week or so of uptime, and multiple suspend/resume cycles) to renew the bluetooth connection with mouse and keyboard.",

            "input": "- Not 32GB, closer to 1GB<br />When plugging in the USB key, my Windows OS recognizes the drive capacity to be 32GB. I can even transfer what seems to be 32GB of file to the drive. However, upon dis/reconnect, I find that the only contents of the drive are the directories that were copied over, and only the first 1GB of contents worth of files.<br /><br />- Not built to last on a key ring<br />If by some off chance the capacity issue is a manufacturing defect, the durability of this  USB key is still something that should steer away any buyer. After two days of keeping this thing on my key ring (before noticing the memory issue), I noticed the two lips of the plastic casing next to the hole for the ring beginning to separate. I removed the drive from the ring and with almost no force I pulled the plastic apart and revealed the insides of the drive. I would feel uncomfortable carrying this drive around unless it was taped/re-glued shut.<br /><br />- In conclusion: Don't skimp on price for this. Stick with Lacie's line of key flash drives. Last I checked they had a 32GB drive for ~30 bucks. I've had an 8GB Lacie key flash drive that's lasted for 6 years on the same key ring that started deconstructing this drive in a few days. I had hoped to upgrade in capacity for a low price, but will end up trashing this drive because it doesn't reliably store data. Even if it did, you'd be better off paying an extra $20 for something that'll last several years, whereas you would otherwise be buying one of these every few months.",

            "input": "In a photograph, it looks simple; in person, this backpack covers all the bases and shows a certain understated \\\\\"\\\\\"classiness.\\\\\"    It has four compartments.   = The front zips down fully to give access to a range of possible items, like keys, flash drives...there's even room for a full-size portable headphone in the full pocket.   = The second compartment, just behind, zips open to a small but deep compartment for miscellaneous items that are somewhat flatter and with less width - good for emergency materials.   = The main section has plenty of room for a MacBook (secured by velcro and protected by a plush lining), with an even larger space in front. Just perfect for my needs.   = Finally, there's a wide section on the bottom for pens and other smaller items.    The material is thick and quite tough, but I was surprised how relatively light it was. Given the loads it carries, the lumbar support makes it easy on your back in transit. Since it's carrying some valuable gear, the design is simple and unobtrusive - you might not think there was so much expensive gear inside. I liked how it keeps bottle-holder out of sight in its  own hideaway velcro slot. At $20-something, it's an exceptional value.    A caveat: If you wear your pack on one shoulder, as I do, you may find that  the lower strap may tear away from the backpack. This has been noted repeatedly. I was able to remedy the problem by sewing monofilament to reinforce the strap. It's not pretty, but this fix extends the life of a pack you might otherwise have to trash. The stitching on the lower left corner is also given to tearing; a hooking needle is your only solution here,    This pack might have profited by being a bit smaller overall. If you're looking for an all-purpose pack, something like the Wenger Synergy might prove more fully versatile -  at twice the price.  This Kensington does the job with panache and restraint - a real winner (if you're willing to do the mod).",

It may not seem worth the extra 50 bucks, but it really is.  It's free wireless downloading FOR LIFE.  Especially great if you plan on getting newspapers or magazines.  The browser is \\\\\"experimental\\\\\".  I hope to see some nice software updates that might make have some improvements.  Don't get this device for web browsing (your will no be satisfied).  That is not what it is made for anyway.  I feel like if it didn't have it already, I wouldn't desire it at all.  One of the other improvements that would be nice with the software would be a clock somewhere in the corner.  I know it's something small, but if you travel a lot and need to keep track of what time it is, that would be a simple yet useful addition.  A lot of people don't seem to like the Kindle because it isn't color.  I've had this one for a while now and honestly, I don't even notice.  As I have read in descriptions before, this is a purpose driven device.  It's made for reading.  It's not an iPad by any means.  The biggest thing that sells me on the Kindle is the screen.  If your going to fly for 4 or 5 hours and want to read a book the entire time like I do, this screen will not strain your eyes at all.  When you first get it, it looks like you need to peel off a plastic cover (that vivid and realistic).  The screen looks like a newspaper or book as it should!  Good job Amazon.",

I had always accepted Macintosh as a sort of \\\\\"stupid person's computer,\\\\\" since we had used them in grade school to a)type things, b)play oregon trail on game tuesdays, and c)learn to type. Also, while growing up my friend's dad had a Performa PPC that he used to a)surf the internet (what little internet there was back then), b)taxes on quicken, and c)check his stocks.<br /><br />Now fast-forward. I had just finished my first semsester of college, and i needed a laptop. At first i run to the nearest box store and pick up a thin and light HP notebook, which had respectable specs for what i needed. 60GB hard drive, 512MB DDR Ram, 1.5Ghz Centrino, and an (advertised) over 5 hours battery life. Wow! for only $1399, i grabbed it in an instant. I had it for 5 days. Right out of the box i booted it up and it ran as slow as my roommates 466 Mhz Celeron that we pulled out of a dumpster b/c he is a cheapskate. 10 seconds to boot up Office? C'mon! I had just spent $1400 on a cool-looking piece of plastic that get beat out by 5 year old celerons. Then that amazing battery life was actually around 2-2.5 hours. Wow again. All that low voltage technology and it can't even get past 3 hours? My god i needed something else. So i returned it promptly and started shopping again.<br /><br />The School Bookstore has always had a plethora of apple products on display because they are one of only two apple dealers in the city (what, Bozeman MT is a small town!). They definitely looked infinitely more sexy than the Performa that my friend and I had grown up with (playing Gridz-- Yeeehaw!) I spent about a week researching this 1.5 Ghz Powerbook. about 19 of the 20 Amazon review gave it 5 stars or (if they could) higher. So i decided to spring for one, because of the Bookstore's return policy and the fact that i needed something before the next semester.<br /><br />Even at purchase i was still skeptical of buying a mac, and at $2500, i thought, it better be a DAMN perfect computer.<br /><br />I have had this powerbook for a week now, and i must say: PC users who hate everything apple: you just need to experience it. I thought i would regret the incompatibilities between XP and OS X, but instead, i spend all my time thinking to myself \\\\\"Why the hell didn't MICROSOFT think of this!!!\\\\\"  This is hands down the tightest software i have ever had the pleasure to use. OS X is not simple, it is logical. Unlike XP, there are never unavailable options because of your incompatible hardware, and best of all: no baloon info! When was the last time a PC user actually needed to be reminded that they had just removed their Usb Key??? Or, in case of a re-install of XP which i did more often than not, Usually an hour or so is spent making sure the OS worked with the computer as best as possible. OS-X works. period. No tweaking, no secret options to increase performance. OS-X is a PC user's dream! Imagine an OS, out of the box, that is already a finely tuned and stripped of its useless features and software, that doesn't crash, doesn't need drivers, doesn't need setting up, and best of all: WORKS!!! If apple can find an easier way to communicate this with the PC population, i'm sure they will have majority market share in a matter of years.<br /><br />I love my Powerbook! I'm sure if you're reading this, you've read other reviews that go through all the \\\\\"duh\\\\\" features and battery life, blah blah. Actually, unless you will use this on your lap for very long periods of time (99% of the time it will be on a library table or airplane tray) it get warm(not hot) but i guess it gets annoying unless its cold out. Also, if apple can create a computer like this, they can definitely make a longer battery. i don't think 5-real life hours is impossible with the additional use of lithium polymer batteries to fill up any extra space inside (like the iPod battery) Also, the screen, when closed, is a wee bit wobbly. I want to see AIRTIGHT seals on the lid, but, again, this really doesn't matter. the 12\\\\\" version is rock solid in this aspect, with the lid closing perfectly tight. I guess it's just an ailment of having a big screen. But these are very minor gripes for a guy wishing apple to create the perfect laptop. Although not quite perfect [yet] This is still far superior to any PC notebook on the market today. One more thing: two buttons and a scroll function on the touchpad. Seriously apple, even that crappy HP had that!<br /><br />But, my minor issues aside, all you need to know is this: I hated macs, am a very literate PC guy (CCNA, A+ certification) who never thought he'd buy a mac. I haven't \\\\\"switched over\\\\\", persay, but my mac is now \\\\\"my computer,\\\\\" and the pc is kept for stuff that doesn't work on the powerbook. Incredible Job, Steve Jobs! An to think, a month ago i was telling friends that Apple should drop computers and just sell iPods! This is NOT the case. Apple should be on top of the market with products like this. 5 out of 5 stars! I love it!space inside (like the iPod battery) Also, the screen, when closed, is a wee bit wobbly.

It is well built and the keys have good responsiveness.  The deal breaker is that the people who designed the layout of the keyboard are not people who use the right shift key (i.e. anyone who types correctly punctuated documents).    Here's the details: they placed the backslash (\\) key in between the slash/question mark key and the right shift key and so every time one reflectively goes for the right shift key one gets a result of a \\ in front of whatever you wanted to capitalize.  Needless to say this really slows down anyone that is trained with regular typing skills.      Looking at the layout, this poor design is even more obvious when you look at how big the Enter key is and how the \\ key could have been placed to the right of the right bracket key (]) as on many other keyboards and had the right shift key be the same size (and distance from pinky finger) as the left shift key, without otherwise affecting the layout.  Very ill-thought design.    The number of times I have had to hit backspace to correct for a \\t type error in this review alone is proof of the lack of design input by touch typists.  Needs to be sent back to the drawing board to make that one revision to get real praise.",

I tossed that piece of junk years ago and opted instead for just headphones.  After years of using just headphones, I felt it would be best to finally get back into using headsets to communicate--I skype a lot more, I'm a better gamer because of it (TF2, BF3, L4D2, SCII (to a lesser degree)) and I won't be changing headsets.<br /><br />The set feels very well built.  Unless you like to take your rage out on devices, this is going to last you a long time.  Yes, it is bulky, so if you don't like massive things covering your head, then I wouldn't recommend sticking with this device.  Volume is easy to control, function buttons are nice (although I rarely use them), and the bar mic is actually bendable.<br /><br />However, there are some slight frustrations with this.  First off, if you have an external set of speakers, there's no pass-thru if you have the USB receiver plugged in.  I have my receiver wire plugged into the back and it's a pain just unplugging it if I want to hear things through my speakers.  Luckily, my desktop speakers are crap, so I only play things on them if I want others to hear.<br /><br />Secondly, there seems to be some mystery as to how long one must depress the power button for this thing to actually turn off.  I'll hold it for two seconds, release, and it'll remain on.  Sometimes I hold it for less, other times I hold it for five seconds and it finally disengages.  It would have been nice if Logitech just put an 'on-off' switch instead of a power button, so I don't have to hold the thing in and hope that it turns on/off when I release it.<br /><br />As for other reviews that I've read on here, I doubt that this thing will ever break with normal, continued use.  Also, I've never experienced a buzzing or interference when I enable the mic on it.  I've read just to drop the mic gain and seeif that works, but as far as this unit goes, it's not a problem.<br /><br />Pros:  AWESOME AUDIO, comfortable, wireless and it's LOGITECH!<br />Cons:  Difficult buttons, no pass-thru for external speakers",

BUT .. 2) it doesn't last long. I think the key is to have a couple of them and rotate to reduce wear and tear.     Here are the reasons why I am buying a second one: The materials are really light. Though light cardboard does not wear and tear well, it is light. the other leather cases I have come into contact with are super heavy, and weight for me is a crucial factor. The design is better than a lot I have seen, and it's actually a nice, soft cover - it feels good in the hand and in the bag. The other options, pcu back and smart cover, make for a hard, sharp little tablet. In my purse, it gauges me, but more importantly, I would be more worried about dropping it than I would in the ipearl case. cardboard, though bulkier, is softer- I think it will absorb shock. maybe I'm wrong, but it feels safer to me. The stylus thing is really handy (replace the stylus!), I like the hand strap, the prop works well.     Cons: the strap. It's a great idea. It's losing it's strength after 3 months, and the ipad is slipping in it's case because of the strap and the cardboard becoming more flexible. Waah! it drives me nuts.     So, it is not going to last for years, but I can't find another one as well-designed or as light, and it's working really well despite these annoying issues, so I am going to try the idea to have more than one case and rotate to reduce wear. ($40 for two, instead of $40 for one I am not thrilled with...)    bwt. it does have the magnetic thing, my ipad turns on and off when I open/close the cover.

It works fine as far as that is concerned.<br /><br />The problem is that when it goes to sleep it is impossible to tell whether it is on or off. There is a tiny yellowish green light in the lower left front of the unit is illuminated when it is plugged in whether it is in sleep mode or off.- this unit stays on my desk so it is always plugged in. The problem is that to wake it from sleep you need to push the power button. This is also how you turn it on when it is off. On my other laptops (Macs) you can wake it from sleep by pushing any button. So the problem is I push the power button when it is off it turns on and, of course, it takes forever to turn it back off again because there are always windows that pop up regarding updates and registering this or that.<br /><br />I haven't discovered how to change the settings so it will wake with \\\\\"any key\\\\\" - if anybody knows please tell me how to do that in the comments section of this review.

With the growth of Chromebooks, there has been some concern that Microsoft is losing its edge, especially in lower-priced computers. The HP Stream 13 is one of the new models that may provide a solution to that problem and become competition to Chromebooks.<br /><br />The Good and the Bad<br />For those of you who want the bottom line right up front, the HP Stream 11 and Stream 13 has both positives and negatives about it. The main reasons to purchase this PC is its price and its ability to run desktop apps, including the full version of Windows 8.1.<br />On the other hand, the main issues that users may have with this smaller device is that it is slow to boot up and only has an average display and touchpad. However, with a price of $200, it has a lot to offer budget-conscious users.<br /><br />In-Depth with the HP Stream 11/13<br />The HP Stream 11 is attractive to look at and will visually appeal to many users with its bright cobalt blue shell. You can also select the magenta shell. Either option is more fun than traditional laptops. The smaller size provides the feel of a netbook, and it is lightweight enough to carry around with you at 2.74 pounds.<br /><br />A white keyboard contrasts nicely with the interior colors and makes it a fun device that you don't usually see at this price point. It has a modern design that will appeal to a younger generation or anyone who is tired of the plain black and grey designs that you usually see in budget laptops. With the same ports you would find on a full-size device, the HP Stream 11 is fully functional. It provides 3.0 and 2.0 USB ports and an SD card reader along with a headphone jack and HDMI socket.<br />The one downside of the hardware for both the HP Stream 11 and 13 is the lower quality display. It doesn't have HD-resolution and the colors can look dull. However, that is common at this price and just a trade-off that you expect to make.<br /><br />Performance<br />In this area, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that the battery life on the HP Stream 11  as well as HP Stream 13 is decent. While it isn't the longest running computer, at just over eight hours, it has a decent run time. It beats out many other Chromebooks in this area and competes well with others.<br />The bad news is on speed. It uses an Intel Celeron N2849 processor, but it runs much slower than many Chromebooks to boot up. It can take up to a half-minute to be ready to use while many Chromebooks take less than 10 seconds. If you aren't in a hurry, this may not matter to you, but it is a fact to be aware of. File transfers are also likely to be slower than on more expensive models.<br /><br />A Winner in Software<br />One of the big wins for the HP Stream 11 is the ability to run a full version of Windows 8.1. Microsoft is also providing 1TB of storage on OneDrive free for a year, which is plenty of storage for the average user. You can also download apps onto the device for convenience. It features a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 to allow you to do all of the things you need on the device.<br /><br />Can It Compete?<br />What it comes down to is if this new device makes Microsoft competitive to Chromebooks. The answer is both yes and no. Yes, because it offers many of the features that you see on Chromebooks that appeals to users. No, because the truth is that there aren't many competitors at this price point. Most of them start at $250 and go on up from there.<br />What this means for Microsoft is that the company is not only being competitive with Chromebooks through the HP Stream 11 and 13, they are winning on price. For the user focused on price, they definitely get their money's worth with this device.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shmou<br />@krishdtech<br />youtube.com/krishdtechrformance  In this area, there is good news and bad news.

The mouse has a \\\\\"stuffed\\\\\" click sound, which is very gentle and very useful if you have roommates or have a baby napping nearby.  The layout was a tiny bit weird at first, mainly because the backspace is touching the 6-key rotation to its right, which took about 1 minute of typing to get used to.  The keys themselves are tilted at a certain angle for comfortable typing and have sticker-based letters so they don't fade if you're an avid typer.  It's the same sticker-like letters that was on my old keyboard which I have owned for 3 years and not a single letter has faded away on it.  It's very good for gamers, as I use the QWER very often for games.  Mouse is comfortable to hold and move and the scrolling is natural.  It even has a slot at the bottom of the mouse to hold the USB for easy transportation without losing the little fellah.  I also like the low-battery indicator on both the keyboard and the mouse.  It's very sturdy and has nice grips on the 4 corners at the bottom and when lifted for the higher adjusted it has 2 grips, but just as stable.  It's very sleek and polished, which gives it a nice feel-good look when typing.  Overall a great product and a great price for it.",

The main thing is the quality looks pretty good, and it's real time, so it is only takes as long as you make it. For people with a more modern DV recorder, I guess you could consider a two step process, moving the VHS over to a mini DV tape, then to you computer, but if your Digital Video Recorder is a little older, this is by far the best way to go, if you are a MAC user, unless you want to spring for a lot more $$$. The directions could have said to install the software, make the hook up connections, and turn the VHS Recorder ON! It forgot that part, but no problem. You can screw up completely but you will eventually get it with this device because it is so EASY. I went up to the Elgato site before starting, to obtain the most current software, since I'm on a Lion IMac with a targetted Mac Pro, just to skip the potential need to upgrade. You probably don't have to do that but why not! The bottom line here is that this is a flawless device with software to match. I'm giving it 4 stars, so that I don't look like a groupie or something. I would be hard put to come up with a negative but I gave it 4 stars because it was just to dam simple. It has a lot of potential, so it's going to be a lot of fun to work with and not have to worry about everything going crackers on you. You just do video. All those home movies that only you will watch. The kind that bring tears to your eyes, not because they are so bad (they're pretty bad, though) but because it's about family and the little things you did together that were so BIG.",

Since it wasn't fair to pay more than 50USD for a mice that didn't completely satisfied my needs I went back to the store willing to pay a few extra bucks more and changed the Logitech by this MS Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer, WHAT A MISTAKE! this is the worst mouse I have ever had!!! and I have used quite a few mouses already (for more than 7 years).

The Keyboard is very cheap, flexes when typing and suffers from some bad ADHD  (it that it cant stay focused for more than a few minutes.)  The keyboard and tablet combo completely fail to be useful because while typing focus jumps from one box to another. Same thing happened to other using the machine so it is not my typing style.<br /><br />We got this because it is cheap and we would not have to worry about it getting stolen while we travel.  It serves that gap nicely.  But this is not a primary device in any way shape or form,  it makes a good surfing tool , but really requires you to sit at a table to type, there is no way to use this on your lap without it falling over and focus jumping around.<br /><br />The magnetic connection with the keyboard is very weak and breaks with the slightest movement,  where as most two in ones have much better mag connections that require force or a trick to disconnect...<br /><br />overall if you need a short term , cheap device this is OK,  if you want something to last 1 or 2 years, I suggest finding something else.",

But, no matter what the angle, the IPAD display is beautiful, colorful and bright by comparison and this looks dull.  Also, the IPAD looks the same from all angles and this display changes with minor head movements.  I went to the store to compare all the tablets (Surface, Surface 2, Galaxy Note/Tab, etc.) and realized that this is just the way of things.  Speed and performance can be had for low prices and this tablet is fine in this regard, but display quality still costs extra.  For me, this is the reason that the IPAD, Galaxy Note and Surface are 3 times as much.  Another friend who viewed the tablet noted that the display looks different from the IPAD in that it *looks* like it has glass over it.  Or, put another way, the display looks a little sunken beneath the glass when compared to more expensive tablets.<br /><br />Update #1 - the power charger died after today.  It still charges, albeit much more slowly, with the USB cable.  I tried to find the charger but no luck.  The model is SBC-05020.  This is one very hot wall wart although I guess that could be because it's dead :).  Still a tablet without a charger isn't much fun.<br /><br />Update #2 - a friend showed me that not all miniUSB chargers are the same.  He leant me his old samsung laptop charger which provides 2.0A at 5V and this charges my Matricom about 10% every half hour.  This will do as an alternative charging device.<br /><br />On the other hand, the tablet had performed flawlessly all day.  I installed XBMC and it drove my HDTV through the HDMI cable with no problems whatsoever.  Now that's impressive.  I do experience what others are saying about the wireless, however.  In fact, while download XBMC, the speeds went from 100kbs to 200kbs depending on my distance from the router (30 ft to 10ft).  Still, it's not a big deal since I should extend the router's range anyway.  Eventhe IPAD and iphones will disconnect in the furthest corners of the house and the difference between these devices and the G-Tab is only 10 or 20 feet shorter in range.<br /><br />Update #3 - I have now emailed Matricom customer support about the dead link to the recovery image with no response.<br />Here's the help page about how to recover:[...]<br />and here's the dead link: [...]<br />My old slow IPAD is still a supported product after all these years, this product seems unsupported right out of the box.  How do I recover when/if it crashes?  Where do I get a charger?<br /><br />Update #4 - Customer support exists! I had no luck with the emails or ticket system but I got an instant response from the \\\\\"online chat\\\\\".

            "input": "Background:  I'm using the WNDR3800 in a 3-story wood-frame house, in a medium-density neighborhood.  The router is on the middle floor, and I get a good wireless signal throughout the house.  I am one of those people who have good luck with routers; my last one is still working after 2 years, and the previous one lasted many years before finally dying.  I bought the WNDR3800 because testing comparisons at smallnetbuilder dot com indicated that it would have a better wireless range than my old router, and have features that I wanted, like a guest network, built-in OpenDNS support, and a Traffic Meter.  Initial setup:  I was impressed with how easy this router was to set up.  I simply unplugged my cable modem, disconnected the old router, and connected the WNDR3800.  I powered up the cable modem and the new router.  I went to my wired Windows 7 desktop and pointed the browser to routerlogin dot net.  I clicked on the big button that said \\\\\"Take me to the internet\\\\\".  A few seconds later the desktop connected.  I updated the firmware to V1.0.0.24 by clicking a button.  Wired networking:  My old router used the 192.168.0.* address space, and this one uses the 192.168.1.* address space.  Most of my wired devices, including my Windows 7 PC, Canon printer, TiVo Premiere, and Windows Home Server, grabbed a new IP address without having to reboot them.  My two older TiVos had to be encouraged to get a new IP address by going into their network settings menus and selecting \\\\\"get (an IP address) automatically from a DHCP server\\\\\", but this took less than a minute and did not require restarting them.  My wired Blu-Ray player had to be rebooted.  Wired transfer speeds between two gigabit Ethernet devices (my desktop and the server) averaged 100 MBps (800 Mbps) for a 0.5GB file.  Netflix streaming to my wired Blu-Ray player and TiVo works without stutters.  DLNA video streaming from my home server to to a wired Blu-Ray player works great and is snappy.  Both my husband and I use Cisco AnyConnect to connect to the VPN servers at work, and neither of us has had any trouble connecting through this router.    Wireless networking:  The router is preconfigured with SSID names and a password for both the 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz networks.  I dreaded setting up our two notebooks, Wii, three iPhones, iPad and a Kindle again, but it was as simple as selecting one of the network names, and typing in the easy-to-remember but hard-to-guess password.  The 2.4GHz gives an excellent signal throughout our 3000 sq. ft. house.  The range on the 5GHz network is somewhat shorter, but there are no other 5GHz networks close by to interfere.  My iPad 2 is the only device that can connect to the 5GHz wireless network; Netflix streaming and DLNA streaming to the iPad works without a hiccup, one floor up and two rooms over from the router location.  My iPhones and iPad are running iOS 5.0.1, and we have iTunes 10.5.1 running on our PCs; Wi-Fi sync between the PCs and the iOS devices is working well over both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.  The Clear Channel Selector worked as advertised.  In my neighborhood there are six 2.4GHz networks on channel 6, two on channel 1 and one on channel 11; the WNDR3800 chose channel 9 for its 2.4GHz network to minimize interference from the other networks.  Administration:  Setting up parental controls with my existing OpenDNS account went smoothly, and now I don't have to run the OpenDNS updater desktop client on my PC, because the router takes care of that.  For my Windows Home Server, I was able to reserve a fixed IP address and forward several ports for remote access.  I turned off UPnP, because I saw that my son's computer was trying to forward several mysterious ports.  The Traffic Meter, which is a great feature, is listed at the end of the Advanced Setup menu.  The reported bandwidth usage seems consistent with what I had measured previously using the Tomato bandwidth meter.  I found it easy to save current router settings to a file from the Advanced menu; I like to do this before a firmware update.  The guest network was simple to turn on:  just check a box, pick an encryption method, set a password and click \\\\\"Apply\\\\\".  Guests cannot see other computers on my regular network, and I can quickly turn the guest network off when I don't need it.  One week later:  The WNDR3800 has been working perfectly, no dropped connections.  I'm glad I bought this router, its wireless range is better than my old router and wired upload/download speeds are improved also.",

I bought this for a coworker, and he's loved it, though I don't personally have one of my own yet.<br /><br />I'll mention that my light Carbon X1 Lenovo running a recent Ubuntu plugged in and utilized the 4K without any issues.

My friend just happened to have one, and this monitor monitor worked fine for him, though he might have had to go tweak some settings to get it to work at the correct resolution or refresh rate; don;'t remember exactly.

Fortunately, the Classic Shell app takes care of this and brings the start menu back, which negates the issues. The only other possible issue would be the lack of storage space. It's about 5GB left after Windows, but we only needed about 500MB, so it didn't matter. If you do need more space, you can just add an SD card.

What happens is that the wires on the left side speaker are poorly constructed with poor isolation/insulation material, so eventually you get a short circuit of the wires as the chaffing inside the left-ear piece wears down the lacquer electrical insulator, creating a short circuit, which causes the left speaker to work intermittently, and eventually stops working completely. Then if you keep using it, eventually the right speaker wiring will also short. The company that makes these needs to redesign them with better quality materials, even if it costs a few dollars more.

I was given the Kindle for Christmas because it has the \\\\\"text-to-speech\\\\\" feature, which allows me to hear the book rather than read it; however, it also has the option to enlarge the text so, whith the help of strong reading glasses, I can actually read it. Even when set on the largest text size, the lines are contained within the screen so no scrolling back and forth is necessary. Large print necessitates clicking the page turner often, but the back/forth page buttons take very little pressure so their use becomes second nature quickly. I have only run into one \\\\\"glitch\\\\\". One of the books I ordered from Amazon.com came in such small print that I was unable to read it even when the text size was at its largest. (Make sure when ordering a book, that you first try the \\\\\"sample me\\\\\" version to see if the text can be enlarged enough to read). Other setting options include a choice of number ofwords per line and line spacing, which make a great difference for the visually impaired reader. The screen itself differs from a computer or ipad screen in that it's not as bright; however, I purchased a small clip-on book light that compensates when more light is needed. The Kindle is advertised as being able to be seen in sunlight and it really is true which makes it possible to read outdoors or in the car. The buttons are much too small for me to see without assistance so it was necessary to memorize the most important ones, ie, the 5-way controller, home, menu and back buttons. (If the keypad were bigger, this item would be perfect for the visually impaired!) Also, the text on the menu and homepage cannot be enlarged which is a drawback, however, instead of ordering books from the portable Kindle, I order them from the Amazon website from my computer which sendes them quickly to my Kindle. Another great feature is that I have installed the Kindle for PC on my computer which syncs it with my portable Kindle, so when necessary, I can go to the computer version to \\\\\"see\\\\\" what I can't see on the portable version.  Curling up with a good book used to be a long-lost dream for the visually impaired, but Kindle has made it possible at a very affordable price! The Kindle iteself is comparitively moderately priced and the price of books is not bad. I've found many that are free and the most I've spent is $9.99 - unheard of for giant-print books if you can even find them.  My only problem now is being able to put my Kindle down long enough to get my work done! :)",

My EVGA GTX970 SuperClocked ACX 2.0 card arrived recently and I did a straight up replacement for my GTX780.<br /><br />I believe I received a defective version of this card. On first boot, I noticed red lines streaking the monitor, which made me immediately power down and reconnect everything. Same result. So then I switched to a different PCIe slot, and even a different computer - with same results. I finally allowed the card to boot, which it did, and installed the most recent Nvidia driver. The card proved very unstable - the red lines persisted, and Windows kept blanking out reporting that the display driver had stopped responding. Once, this resulted in blue screen. After about an hour of trying to troubleshoot, one of the fans on the card began making a noise like an air raid siren, unlike anything I had ever heard before. Immediately powered down, validated all internal and external connections, and tried to power up again with same results. Unreal noise and still had red lines and stability problems.<br /><br />So back in the box it went, and it's on it's way back to Amazon as we speak. I couldn't get a replacement sent from Amazon as the card is out of stock with no estimated date. (Of note, I have also previously tried a GTX970 from MSI, which arrived DOA -wouldn't even boot). This makes me think that this is an Nvidia issue more than an EVGA issue. So I'm back to my tried and true GTX 780 for now, and will be a way early adopter of Nvidia products in future.<br /><br />I don't doubt that there are people whose 970 cards are working fine, but 0/2 is enough to make me pause for a while on this generation until they've had more of a chance to work out the kinks.",

Since the wired portion of the router is 10/100, your wireless-n will definitely be throttled down to something less than 100 Mb/s.  My connection speed is generally 75 Mb/s so I've had no opportunity to test this out.<br /><br />However with the quirks in the firmware (and I only mentioned the one that bothered me the most), and the limitations, I think it's a good little router for 95% of people.

The sleeve has very little padding however, so if you're looking for something with thicker padding, this sleeve is not it.

My laptop is 13.5 inches in width, so it fits perfectly well with some space remaining for the mouse and charger. Overall, I like it because it does what I wanted it to do which was to hold my laptop with primary accessories and it protects my laptop from scratches.",

The V7 delivers crisp, sharp images and excellent color rendition. Originally I connected the monitors to my PC using analog cables but the contrast ratio and image quality weren't the best. Some reviews suggested using a DVI digital connection, so I changed to DVI. Wow, it made quite a big difference! The results were excellent. For the price, these monitors can't be beat.

I really dislike Windows 8. If you like to keep all your devices synced I can see the purpose of it, but I just need a work horse for school. I do not like how the windows 8 version of files overrides the programs I want to use. It creates difficulties when I have to scan a document for an assignment and the professor can't read the Windows 8 format, and I haven't found a way to save it as a PDF without the file becoming corrupted. I have to first scan any paperwork with Windows scan and fax, save it to the desktop, copy and paste it into a Word doc, and then upload that to Blackboard. I have looked online for a way round this but have not been successful. As a slight improvement I have downloaded Classic Shell and now have a start up button that allows me to access files more in windows 7 style. If this was running windows 7 it would be ideal.

Fortunately, their customer support is very good, however, i was without a burner for over a month and a half waiting for their super slow warranty replacement process. After finally receiving my replacement drive in 5/01, it performed flawlessly, with approx. 250 burns completed, it bit the dust just last week (mid 8/01). What a disappointment for the time and $$ spent on what is regarded as one of the top drives. I have never had this much trouble with a piece of electronic equipment and i do not abuse my equipment. i purchased an HP 9700i 16x burner as a replacement (which has performed equally as well but a little slower than the plextor - only noticeable if you're looking at your stopwatch) until plextor can send me a new drive...when and if i get the replacement.",

Isn't the keyboard that comes with the computer good enough? And could I justify buying a mechanical keyboard for $100 bucks? Well, this suspicious product from a suspicious company was the happy medium. For $40 I would get a chance to test a mechanical keyboard... even if some of the keys looked a little funky.<br /><br />Considering any type of hardware coming from a sketchy company, I was surprised that it plugged and worked right away. The keyboard is heavy, and definitely feels like a quality product. While some people might not be fond of the orange keys... they actually make little to no difference while typing.<br /><br />However, in my opinion the main issue with this keyboard is the damn backspace key. The backspace key honestly seems to be the smallest key on the entire damn keyboard, which means you'll really need to practice on this keyboard for quite some time before you truly are able to make some gains in typing speed over a 'friendlier' membrane keyboard.<br /><br />All in all, nice solid product, and I figure I would do them the courtesy of reviewing (now that it is back in stock!).

The problem people have with this computer is that it's a low end computer and they are expending it to perform much faster than it will. This computer should be compared to an HP Stream line of laptops.<br /><br />Next: Make sure you should read this review: (http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSA678YAXX25/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJH3TG&nodeID=541966&store=pc) by Johnny Gonzalez (March 24, 2015). He's an owner that tells you what to expect and how to improve the machine. I have to correct Johnny on one point. I looked up the memory size limit and Dell specifies that this laptop has one slot that will take a 16GB memory module.<br /><br />You should also note in your research that being able to upgrade is a big plus, because now days in the low end market [Windows and Chrome] memory is soldered on and not upgradable. And on most Chromebooks the HD are not accessible for upgrading.<br /><br />Plus the Windows version is 64Bit so you can use the full use memory past 4GB. This isn't true on many of the other low-end Windows machines.<br /><br />Also I found this machine on sale today at Dell and Fry's for less than $200 while at couple of online stores I note the price at over $300. So be sure to shop this machine.<br /><br />Now for the most surprising thing I found: Dell sells two different machines in the Inspiron 14 3000 series. The better of the two isn't listed on Amazon, but you can find it on Dell's site. The other machine comes with 4GB of RAM and the Pentium N3540 quad-core processor (almost twice as fast as the Celeron N2840 dual-core found in this machine). And the best part was that it was only $80 more (sale price at this time) for the much better computer.<br /><br />One last point: I think it's extremely unfair to rate down this machine because it has Windows 8 on it, because you're going to get Win8 on any Windows machine you buy today. So if you rate it down for this one you have to rate all Windows 8 machines down the same amount to be fair. IMHO: If you don't like Windows 8 you can replace it with a copy of Windows 7 OEM ($100), or Linux Mint (free), or Windows 10 preview (free).ir.

The same tabs, same TPU (rubberized outermost layer, silicon skin). The only difference is this unit doesn't have a keyboard. There's a potential adjustment for the leather hand-carry strap.<br />Features: This feels like a bulletproof shell over the Air. It feels substantial, safe, secure. The ports are all securely covered, except the camera. Odd, for I thought a claim is this unit is splash resistant. I'm not sure what happens if water gets splashed onto the cutout for the camera (and I'm not going to try any experiments!). There's a collapsible arm stand that unfolds at a great angle for my use. It is metal and strong. The large &#34;wheel&#34; on the back lets one rotate the arm stand in 360 degrees, locking in on 45 degree angles. The only downside is the protective front screen. It is not quite as clear / transparent as the Air without a protective film and actually shows moire patterns. Perhaps this is a small price to pay for the degree of protection. Last, as a burgeoning aviator addicted to ForeFlight, I'm better able to secure this device in the MyBigClip kneeboard velcro strap than the NT610KR.<br />Conclusion: If one prefers the durability, the security of the NT610KR without the need for the keyboard most of the time, this unit is for you.",

It's the configuration of the 3 profiles that can get real annoying when you take it to somebody else's house and have to use the supplied CD in their home computer, hardwire the adapter to their router, and configure it using the software to recognize their wirless network, then disconnect it and then connect it to your gaming console. If you forgot to bring the disc, you will have a fun time digging on linksys's website for the software. The antennae on this adapter is not spectacular, expect to get a little more than half the range you would with a wirless notebook. Problems aside, this is still the most affordable option for wireless gaming, not to mention the adapter's other uses as a wireless ethernet bridge for computers and other devices (since &quot;wirless bridges&quot; usually cost 99 bucks) it's still a great deal",

Wished I had installed the STX sooner because the STX has a far better picture/video and sound/audio quality over the 4000.<br /><br />I've read here, in the user reviews, where some people are having \\\\\"issues\\\\\" with their Logitech webcams not working correctly after installation and with Skype, Messenger, Yahoo etc.---maybe I can provide some helpful info to correct those problems.<br /><br />First, when installing the Logtiech software from either the CD or directly from the Logitech website---if it asks you if you want or has a checkmark in \\\\\"Logitech Desktop Messenger\\\\\" say NO or UNCHECK it (if you find that it was installed then un-install/remove Logitech Desktop Messenger) there is \\\\\"something wrong within it\\\\\" which will cause your webcam not to perform correctly---I discovered this while doing some research on the Logitech forums.<br /><br />Secondly, after the installation, when you are done selecting your webcam's video/audio settings to your liking---and you have any of the \\\\\"video chatting\\\\\" programs (Skype, Windows Live Messenger, AOL, Yahoo etc.) then go to each individually and do the webcam settings (audio/video) to make sure audio/video is working correctly and that that program RECOGNIZES your webcam---do this BEFORE making your first \\\\\"video or audio chat\\\\\".<br /><br />Hope these helpful hints help those who maybe having problems.",

            "input": "PROS - much improved sound in a sleek unified unit, adjustable settings *****<br />CONS - cover not durable, inaccurate set-up instructions, some sound artifacts ***<br />These speakers make me want to start watching movies and tv on my ipad.  Seriously, once I set it up and heard a bit, I started looking for available movies which I had missed.  Previously I found the ipad too weak of a player to be interested in online videos, but the results with this device are impressive.  I really like the way this sleek case with multiposition cover becomes part if the ipad itself, making it so much easier to use and move around than other ipad external speakers. I don't mind the extra width needed for the speakers themselves, but if you carry it around a lot, the added weight could be annoying.  Two+ people could easily sit together and watch something.<br /><br />These speakers also do a great job with music, letting you hear more instruments with clarity, and bass notes, than with either the poor little built-in speaker, or earbuds.<br /><br />MY CAT: was alternately captivated and frightened by the meowing sounds that came out of these speakers when I played some cat videos from youtube, which shows how much better the sound quality is (previously she has never been interested in cat videos before, either online or over-the-air on our tv).  I tried to find technical specs on the Belkin site about frequency response (so I could compare it to my old audiophile equipment) but I couldn't find any; however the verizonwireless site's description of this product claims it is 40-20,000 Hz, with a signal to noise ratio of 91dB.<br /><br />With the (non-required) app, you can set music source to either music, cinema, or gaming, for different sound qualities, and you have three degrees of speaker separation.  Apparently lots of this is done through digital signal processing with a chip and amplifier in the device.  As the sound channels are more widely separated, however, some echoing appears as an artifact (which some may enjoy).<br /><br />ISSUES: Overall, I am really happy with this device, however:<br /><br />- Regarding design, when the cover is closed, the little Belkin charging light in the speaker area is covered (I am considering punching a hole).  Also, though it is \\\\\"smart cover style\\\\\", it doesn't have the little magnet that automatically turns the ipad on and off as you open and close the cover (I am thinking of trying to add one myself).  Additionally, if you need to connect to the ipad for some other reason (e..g camera connector, moving files to a laptop), you have to take it out of the case, not that big of an issue however.  Otherwise it does a great job preserving access to all the switches and ports and cameras, and it is nice that it charges the ipad itself as well as the Thunderstorm speakers.  (However, I am concerned that wattage is not optimized for the ipad and may cut battery life).<br /><br />ETA: After little more than a week of use, the edge of the cover has started separating.  This does not affect the great sound of this product, but is quite disappointing.  It still works fine as a stand, but is a bit fussier to open.<br /><br />- Regarding documentation, they said to install the Thunder app (implying that it is necessary), then start using it.  Well, once the Thunderstorm was installed and the app was opened, all it did was direct me to a web page of support info, which only told me how to mechanically install the Thunderstorm (which I had already done).  It didn't tell me how to get from the app support page to actually allowing me to change the sound settings, and there seemed to be no way beyond this window.  It took me a long time to contrive a way to make this work: leave the app, start playing a video in youtube, and then restart the app which finally realized that I already has the Thunderstorm installed, then finally it let me change sound settings.  But it turns out that the app itself is not required to use the device, only to change sound settings -- you can just install the Thunderstorm and start listening (without the options that the app offers).  (It would be nice if settings could be changed in some way within the video playing, instead of having to leave the video and fire up the app.)  And, as noted above, the only place I could find technical specs were on a third-party page.  Belkin needs to be more accurate and complete with information both in the box and on the website (this may have improved by the time you are reading this).o use the device, only to change sound settings -- you can just install the Thunderstorm and start listening (without the options that the app offers).

My battery should charge when I plug in my power supply.

I was not fooled though, &#34;Ivan&#34; sounded suspiciously Asian. I do not dislike Asians, but don't try to fool me by tagging them with a different name. Some of my best friends are Asian or of Asian decent. I digress.... back to the topic at hand.<br /><br />After purchasing your computer I immediately had problems. Your website said I needed to change the power supply. I did and there was no change in status. Computer still broken.  I tried your all wise website again. It felt I needed to try changing the power supply.... again. No, I'll take the guy with the heavy accent this time. After an hour of waiting and being transferred, the guy was very polite and actually a good credit to your company as I have said earlier, but he was only authorized to tell me to send my computer away to a service center and inform me that I'll get it back in a few weeks.  No thank you. I can do without coffee for a few weeks. I can go without human interaction for weeks. I can't do without quick books for even a few days.  &#34;Please send me a new computer so that I may transfer files and YOU can have the broken one,&#34; I said. Better yet, &#34;Give me a refund so that I may purchase a different brand. You can still have your broken computer.&#34;<br /><br />Ivan was nice enough to inform me that I had run out of decisionson his end and that repairing their broken computer would still cost me two to three weeks of downtime.  The best he could offer me was an address to Toshiba in California where I could write a letter and let it rot on someone's desk. No thanks, I'm hoping this gets your attention sooner than that snail mail letter.<br /><br />In case you want to find me, you can look up my contact information through my computer serial number which is 8D338950Q.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />JPL",

I like this because mobility and not creating clutter is important to me.<br /><br />This is a right handed mouse, my hands are not overly big and it feels comfortable to me to use. I have always used my mice with a claw grip or relaxed claw grip and this mouse allows for comfortable operation using these grips.<br /><br />The extra buttons are well placed and handy for gamers of all genres.<br /><br />Feels solid and sturdy, nice soft materials for the non glossy finishes.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />This list could be quite large mainly due to the fact that while aesthetically it is a very appealing mouse, functionally it severely falls short of expectations. I would have returned this mouse had I not thrown out the packaging prior to using it for a period of time.<br /><br />I have not experienced the connectivity issues that many here have experienced. The Bluetooth connection initiates fairly quickly when resuming from sleep, and after extended mouse inactivity the delay is minimal. However, connection after start-up is buggy. At times I have had to wait up to 30 seconds, and at times I've had to restart the connection all together.<br /><br />The USB dongle also feels useless, it fails to provided an added performance benefit over the Bluetooth when it should be expected. When I plug the dongle in it always has to install drivers, every time, and it takes up to a minute for the connection to finally establish and the mouse to be useable. I've tried multiple methods of installing drivers and software.<br /><br />Now the the real issue. The 6400dps laser sensor is very poor, inadequate, and inaccurate. It fails to track on many surfaces, including a Razer mousepad. The movement seems awkward, jagged, delayed, as if the cursor was refreshing at 20 fps. I've attempted numerous settings and registry adjustments to eliminate mouse acceleration and provide a smoother experience but it simply remains very sup par when compared to wired mice like the Thermaltake Ventus or very old Razer mice.<br /><br />The price is reflective of the looks rather than the performance. The performance is poor in-game as well as desktop and the price is very high compared to it's value in my opinion.",

Setup was extremely easy and quick. Instructions were clear and simple. Unplug modem, connect router to it, turn both on, go to your laptop, open browser, go to routerlogin.net, update firmware and you are done. The whole thing took less than 5 minutes. My first netgear router took 5 hours to setup.<br /><br />Performance: I have not tested ac speeds yet, but on wireless n it is really great and stable. I noticed that I am hovering around 25 Mbps download on all devices with little change. I also noticed that speed is remaining relatively stable on other devices while say streaming video on iPad or syncing large files to Dropbox and so on. In case you have not used netgear routers before, this is a huge deal. Previous models used to bring speeds to a crawl on other devices once you stream video or sync to a cloud service.<br /><br />Range: I live in a 900 sq ft 2 bedroom apt, and I am covered all the way down to the parking lot.<br /><br />Software: this is not news but netgear making software is like a chicken writing poetry. This is my 4th netgear router in about 8 years and they still have the same bad, constantly freezing, unresponsive, unintuitive software. In case you have not guessed, I am talking about the so called \\\\\"genie\\\\\". It is really bad. I tried it online, on desktop and iPad. And it is frustrating and confusing in every which way it could. Besides, it does not like chrome. It works much better and freezes a lot less on Internet explorer. It does get the job done but you want to get away from it ASAP.<br /><br />Customization: this is a new generation of device, meant for the non-techie public. As you might know, the router got a bad rap from early adopters who tend to be demanding highly knowledgeable users. The router comes already set up with typical settings down to network name and unique randomly generated password. If you start fiddling around, for tighter security, more control, custom channels, device priority etc... You will run into a lot of trouble. However, if you keep the typical settings, it works flawlessly. Don't try to bake a pie on a toaster, use it for what it is, a shiny toaster.<br /><br />Looks: I have to put the router in my living room close to the tv because I need the wired connection for The various netflix streaming devices. And I have to say it is BIG and UGLY. It has less lights than previous models and no blinking lights but it has a big NETGEAR brand name front and center. It feels like I am running an infomercial for netgear in my living room. Note: its large footprint makes it a lot sturdier than previous models, much less likely to tip over.<br /><br />Now, I have owned this router for about 12 hours and I will be updating over the next days and weeks as I gain more experience.<br /><br />Update 12/07/12: can you say stable. This router continues to amaze. The wifi connection on both bands, multiple channels is just<br />stable. I can't believe how fast my iPad is downloading apps. Note: my frame of reference is my previous netgear WNDR4300.<br /><br />UPDATE 01 11 13: I have had R6300 router for a little over a month. Initially it worked perfectly, consistently giving 25 MBPS down and 4 Mbps up wirelessly on my windows laptop, iPad, samsung galaxy nexus, and Asus android tablet. A few days ago the speeds dropped significantly on all devices for no apparent reason. I can barely get 1-2 Mbps down and 4 up. IT is like a slow death where the download speeds keep dropping daily. I called Comcast and they advised to connect laptop directly to the modem (Motorola SB6141) via Ethernet. That gave 25 Mbps down and 4 up indicating it is not the modem or Comcast. So I turned off the router and unplugged for a minute then turned it back on and the same problem continued (1-2 Mbps down). Then I reset the router through the orange reset button andset it up over again, updated firmware using genie and kept same network names, passwords and security as configured by factory. Again I am still having the same problem, download speeds are miserably low (1-2 Mbps down and 4 up).<br />Note 1: I tried streaming Netflix over a wired connection from the router to the Sony bluray player and it streamed fine.<br />Note 2: I disabled my laptop wireless adapter and connected through wireless USB adapter A6200 on 2.4 and 5G but also got 2.33 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up.<br /><br />the connection is not getting dropped, the router is not rebooting, no blinking lights. All my devices show a good signal to router locally. Just slow internet and slowing further as we speak.<br />I do not know what to do next. Something suddenly went wrong with this router, and I cannot figure it out. I contacted netgear but have not heard from them yet. I also posted on their forum but have not gotten any good answers yet.set it up over again, updated firmware using genie and kept same network names, passwords and security as configured by factory.

I don't know about others but mine has really dark screen and poor color accuracy. Overall, it's like orange tone.

I think this is a major issue about this LCD cuz I'm pretty sure that there are many people who are not familiar with calibration.     I'm just returning this and going to get Dell 2408wfp.

What a disappointment.    I spent a week using it. By the end of the week I wanted it to die a slow painful death. Perhaps I could put it in a shredder or drive a car over it and cackle as it was destroyed.     The problem with it is very simple, and perhaps even correctible. Clicking.    Tap-to-click is far too sensitive, and the sensitivity is not adjustable. It was constantly thinking that I had tapped on something when I was thinking I hadn't. My laptop's trackpad doesn't have this problem. If there was an adjustment for the sensitivity, I could have adjusted it and probably ended up happy.    You can also click by pushing down on the trackpad; it's all one giant button. But it takes vastly too much force to click that way. I don't have any way of measuring, but I estimate that I have to push 10 times as hard on the trackpad to get it to click as I do on a mouse button. It literally wears out my finger, and it's very clumsy. And, again, there is no sensitivity adjustment.    If Apple comes out with a revised version of this trackpad I'll buy one and try it, because I really want it to work. But this one doesn't work.",

If I go 40 feet from the router I get the message that I don't have connectivity. The transformer is also rebooting on its own. This never happened during the first six weeks - and it seems to be getting more frequent.  My first guess is that a patch came and began the problems. When the connectivity issues began, I did a factory reset and everything was great again. Then - unfortunately without thinking - I allowed a number of updates to be done and was back to the irritating no connectivity unless sitting on the router. I do not want to continually do factory resets - period!!  I hope ASUS Support gets their act together before I replace it with an IPAD. I wouldn't recommend a transformer until these issues are solved.",

Reality though was a bit different.  Anybody that calls this a cheap tablet needs to be taken out and smacked with a stack of Ipad 2s until they come to their senses.  It is not a tablet, it isn't even that good of a book reader.  For as long as Amazon took to work on this, it feels rushed and buggy.  When half of amazons own content wont even work with it at this point and the plans for fixing that are months or years in the future.  It does have a few good things.  The sound is good, as are the colors and the sharpness of picture.  The fact I could at least drag and drop part of the content directly to a folder was very nice indeed.  There are 3 main issues.   #1, as has been said by many.  The Information and  buying have to be shored up. Look Amazon, I know you see this is a way to sell stuff any time somebody wants, but you need to use a bit of common sense.  #2, It is SLLLLOOOOWWWW.  If this is Amazons idea of a speedy unit, I would hate to use one they considered slow.  Changing from one thing to another has a noticeable pause, and if the unit is on for a couple of hours, the pause can be in the 3-5 second range before it does whatever you want.  #3  The big ZERO for me though, is the fact though Amazon has had many months to get ready for it, content they themselves are pushing, such as the Unbox has no timetable for an update as I was told sometime in 2012.  It forced me to upload content I purchased from Amazon, to their Cloud service to load it on my device.   If you want a device that does everything the Fire was advertised, I would wait until the Fire 2 or 3 comes out, or do like I am going to do, return this and buy a Nook.",

I have pretty much all of the functionality of OpenWRT although not all of the bugs have been fixed yet.  Still it's been going strong for several days now.  The stock firmware is both unintuitive and limited.  It was apparently designed to be pretty, but for the price this router normally goes for, I can't see paying that kind of money for this thing.  It's selling point is getting the Open Sourced fancy firmware's running.  Which is what I have going right now.  Codel QOS, Dual-Band 802.11ac, partridge in a pear tree.

I guess I expected too much.  I really wanted to like this device, but Amazon has missed out on some important details.  The on-off button is impossibly small and difficult to locate.  There is no tactile feel to the thing.  You have to visually locate it and then use the edge of your fingernail to get it to depress.  When you attach the charger there is no visual indication (light or LED) to confirm that the unit is, in fact, correctly attached and charging, and, of course, no way to know that charging is completed short of starting the thing up and checking the on-screen battery icon.  I have purchased a number of apps from the Amazon app store using my desktop computer, but when I go to my kindle, they are nowhere to be found.  Only way I can find them is to go to the app store on the Kindle and download them, of course this won't work until you return to your Amazon account and delete them first.  You also have to buy the charger separately.  The \\\\\"Fast\\\\\" charger costs $19.  Fast meaning 5 hours or so.  Sure, you can charge form a computer USB port, but if the \\\\\"fast\\\\\" charger takes 5-6 hours, I'm thinking maybe 10-12 from the USB port.  Oh, by the way, did I mention that the battery life is very poor.  I get maybe 3.5 to 4 hours out of mine, then it has to be recharged.  Amazon really hyped the audio quality.  Another letdown.  Audio is OK, but certainly nothing special.  The cheapest little external speaker you can stick on the thing beats the internal speakers.

I have been an Amazon Prime member for a number of years and am a big fan of the company.  They have always treated me fairly.  But boy, did they miss the boat with the new Kindle.  Don't know who was in charge of the development project, but maybe he/she could get a new job developing a map function for Apple.she could get a new job developing a map function for Apple.",

Too many people have had this issue with this router.  I would avoid it.  I finally got tired of it and took it back.  Maybe I could have monkeyed with it but why mess with it when you can just get a router that probably works.  Walmart was great to honor the return even after the 90 day period was up.  I purchased a Belkin N600.  That's working well so far, but since everything is Chinese junk anymore it is hard to tell how long that will even last.  Bonus on the Belkin N600.

I've decided to eat the cost and simply vow never to deal with this company again because I just don't have time to mess around this junk any longer. Perhaps this is how they make their money--knowing customers will simply get tired of trying to get their money's worth.

I really wish you could rate something zero stars.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- When plugged in it caused other USB devices that normally work flawlessly to either completely fail or to disconnect/reconnect every few minutes.<br />- Does not support white balance.  The colors are terrible, everything in the image was very orange.<br />- Night vision doesn't seem to work at all.  In low light image is nearly black.<br />- There is an in-line adjustment knob on the USB cable.  Its how you adjust brightness, how incredibly manual and inconvenient of them.  Even the $4 super cheapo web cams have auto-exposure that works.<br />- The instructions are a single page and say nothing useful.  The back of the page is blank, so they had space to say things they just didn't.<br />- I downloaded the \\\\\"manual\\\\\" from their web site.  After un-RARing it was a single 1MB JPG image.  A photo of another single 8.5x11 sheet, but different than the one that came with the camera!  This one talked about drivers.<br />- There are no drivers that come with the device, but there are drivers on the iMicro web site.  There is no information available anywhere that says what the driver does, what operating systems its for, etc.  Given that their hardware won't play nice and conflicts with other hardware, I fully expected the driver to corrupt my system or do something equally horrible to other software.  Needless to say, I was not willing to install it and take a risk.<br />- I'm only 90% - 95% certain about this, but I believe its only 640x480 and not the 1.3 mega pixel they claim.  I'd have to plug it back in to check and its not worth the hassle of my other devices freaking out again.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- It looks pretty and has a handy clip.  It really does look nice, probably the best looking web cam I've used.

I too am upset with the fact that this Maxtor Box came with a Quantum Fireball drive inside.  I read in another review that someone was upset with the note they received in their box telling them that they could not use the utility software that came with it.  I either missed that or didn't get it.  Call me crazy, but I just assumed that the software that came with the drive should work.<br />I've been trying to configure this drive as a primary drive on anyone of three systems for weeks now.  Two systems didn't have a new enough BIOS for the drive even though niether of them were more than a year old.  So I decided to use the third system which is brand new.  The problem is that I have a full version of Windows 95 and upgrades for Windows 98 and Windows ME.  The Windows 95 setup won't even run, probably because WIndows 95 is only capable of handling drives up to 32 gigs.  So I decided to try Windows NT 4.0, which I also have.  After all sorts of problems, I got NT installed only to find out that it believed the 40 gig drive was a 2 gig one and that it was just about full.<br />During all of these problems, I've been exploring the Maxtor Knowledge Base for answers, which sure didn't come with the drive.  It was only then did I learn that I probably shouldn't be using the MaxBlast software that came with it.  Ridiculus.<br />It seems that most of these other consumers have installed it as a second drive or with a newer full version of Windows, such as a Windows 98 OEM.  If you plan on using it as a primary drive, good luck.  You're going to need it.",

It is heavy and cumbersome to carry in my purse, so I thought I would try<br />LifeProof n\u00fc\u00fcd Case & Cover/Stand for iPad Gen 2/3/4 - White / Gray.<br />I liked the look and feel of the case as well as it not seeming to be as heavy as the Otterbox. The &#34;likes&#34; stop there. Most of these dislikes are personal as some people probably love these features.<br />I HATED having to have a headphone adapter. It was difficult for me to screw in and if its not tightened properly, headphones do not work right. I use my headphones every night so this is a big deal for me. I also knew I needed extra adapters because what if I forgot it  and needed my headphones? The prospect of having to carry the adapter in my wallet and hope I didn't lose it was not something  I was looking forward to.<br />Next and almost as important is the cover/ stand. Oh my gosh what an epic failure. It was hard for me to get off, flimsy and the angle for typing will promote carpal tunnel syndrome at the very least. I watch T.V. in bed and with the Otterbox cover/stand my Ipad is steady without me having  to constantly re-prop it. Otterbox also snaps off a whole lot easier. There isn't a magnet in the Lifeproof cover so my Ipad didn't go off when cover was on unless I did it.<br />My next observation just might be me, but I have had to charge my Ipad daily (battery level 5%) since having the Lifeproof case. I have no idea why unless it was staying on all the time.<br />I already have a Zagg screen protector installed on my Ipad so not having one with the Lifeproof case was not an issue to me.<br />As far as protection goes the LifeProof case is like having your Ipad in an armored tank.<br />I am returning the Lifeproof case and cover. The heaviness of the Otterbox seems very minor compared to all the things I did not like about the Lifeproof case and cover.",

It does function, to a degree, but needed a lot of tuning to even reach that.<br /><br />Noteable issues:<br />1. Fast battery drain, even after utilizing many options given on the internet for extending battery charge.  Mine drains in about 1 hour, maybe a bit more.  I usually leave it plugged in nowadays.  There also does not appear to be a way to replace the battery without destroying the device.  So when the battery goes, apparently so will the device.<br />2. Poor touch-sensitive screen, even after calibration.  Finger-touch sensitivity is very poor.  It often won't respond, or will trigger another key/feature.  I've found better success using a capped pen as a stylus, though it still sometimes misses. You also have to go slow on the keypad with password, or it will fail to register a few character.  Very awkward and frustrating at times, though adaptable.<br />3. Incompatibility with Google Play Store app.  This despite being a Google product.  I've looked over Google's compatibility list, and X-Treme is not list.  This means a lot of apps, notably Chrome for Android in my case, are not installable. (Apparently someone has created a work-around posted on YouTube.  I've not tested that.)  The manufacturer has installed their own apps market instead.  Much fewer options, though some are useful.<br />4. Terrible default browser.  Very slow and often locks up.  I tried installing Chrome,only to run into the problem in point #3.  I did gain a measure of success by downloading Opera Lite, which proved much faster and better overall, though I'm still not able to run certain things like videos on CWTV.com's website.<br />5.

They were great while they lasted.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These speakers sound great for both music and speaking voices. Another reviewer mentions that when he uses headphones with these speakers, he hears a clicking noise. His speakers or headphones must be defective; I tried these speakers with headphones and did not find anything wrong. No annoying noises at all.<br /><br />I also bought these cheaper speakers from Amazon: [[ASIN:B000R9AAJA Logitech S120 2.0 Multimedia Speakers]]. The cheap ones are good enough for talking voices but not for music. Any music sounds noticeably poor coming out of the cheap speakers, even if you are not picky about music. The Z130 speakers are worth the money in that the music sounds excellent. So, if you listen to music or watch movies on your computer (or any other gadget), these are worth it. If you only watch news and other such mostly talking programs on the internet, then the cheaper speakers are good enough.<br /><br />Also note: The cheaper speakers' knob fell off the first day I used it, but it stuffs right back in. The Z130 doesn't have this problem. The design is elegant, giving the impression of being a set of expensive speakers.<br /><br />So, I am letting my husband use the cheaper speakers on his computer while I use the Z130. :)",

Trouble shooting the device in the 12 hours I had it in my possession showed that even removing the failed drive, the system continued to lockup. So the lockup issue is separate from a bad disk. The fatal flaw is a combination of the poor execution of software and operating system and a complete lack of support by the manufacture.

BUT...we had a problem with the video component of the laptop after only about 6 months.  We returned it to Acer (they have no local service facility and they REQUIRE that you ship it back to them at YOUR cost) for repair because it was still under warranty.  About two weeks later we received the laptop back, with an apparent puncture in the screen and huge cracks emanating from that down either side of the screen.  There was no note or explanation from Acer.      I called Acer Tech Support and I was told that there is a crack in the screen and I had to pay $199 for them to repair it.     I told them that there was NOT a crack in the screen when I sent it to them, that I shipped it to them following their instructions to the letter (actually it was packed better than they suggested, in about 5 inches of bubble wrap all around), and I expected them to repair or replace the laptop.      They claim that the damage must have been caused in shipping, but I disagree.  I honestly believe they caused the damage and are now trying to cover it up.  In the interest of customer service, you would think they would just fix or replace it (what would that cost them in real costs?  $100? Come on Acer, grow up).  As it was I was on the phone for two hours straight, first with foreign (India) tech support reps, and then with US based (I think) Customer Service reps.  I spoke to 4 different people and they were all steadfast in their determination not to help me - to them, apparently, I was a liar and therefore I had to pay for the repair.     I asked for a mailing address so I could file a written complaint with their company, and the CS rep said he didn't know the address where he came to work every day (this exchange provided the only comic relief in hours of painful exchange - I said \\\\\"OK, when you drive in in the morning, what does it say on the front of the building?\\\\\"  He replied that he didn't know).    I called Amazon customer service the next day, and was told it was the manufacturer's responsibility to take care of this and that Amazon couldn't (or rather wouldn't) help me.      Acer says I have to go to the shipper and try to get money from them.  I believe that Acer caused the damage (and if they didn't, their product is inherently defective if it cannot be shipped in a closed position) and they should do the right thing and replace the now completely unusable laptop.     I would avoid buying any Acer product unless you are prepared for a Customer Service nightmare.  A good deal on a cheap little laptop isn't such a good deal after all when the company won't stand behind their product, and when Amazon won't stand behind their most faithful customers.     If you have already purchased an Acer product, and find that you need to return it for service - take pictures of every aspect of the product before you ship it.  This way when they call you, their customer, a liar, you have photographic evidence to the contrary.    If you haven't purchased an Acer product yet - think twice.  You may pay a little more for Sony or LG or another higher quality brand, but you might find you have a partner rather than an enemy when you need their help.     I am giving this one star only because you can't go any lower.    Shame on you, Acer and Amazon, for the awful treatment of your customers.      Addendum:  I sent Amazon a copy of this review and they offered to refund the purchase price.  They did this within 20 minutes of my sending an e-mail through their \\\\\"Contact Us\\\\\" page.  Way to go, Amazon - you have restored my faith in you.  Acer, however, continues to battle me every step of the way, and regardless of Amazon's noble action, I plan to file a complaint with the BBB and elsewhere.",

I tried every configuration - selecting specific channels, using auto for channel, etc.  I spent many hours over a few days to make it work better.  To no avail!  Finally, I decided to try it as a 'satellite' for my 150 via power over ethernet system (ZyXEL) that I had set up for another purpose, and we are now able to get on to the network consistently from the back room.  This is NOT a very big house (1500 SF).  I decided it was better than the hassle of returning it, so the use of it as a satellite to the base router (the original 150 I've had for 5 years) works, but did I need to spend $70 for that?  I won't even go into how hard it was to get documentation/help for this.  I typed in AC750 into the Netgear support site, and the result was Not Found?

I tested the machine at the Intel site and Intel says the HD graphics are the 2000 series (half the processing capabilities) and NO higher level audio processing seems to be taking place!<br />The HDMI needed to support the sound capabilities listed above (as the optical can't do them without the HDMI) simply does not pass the higher level audio through to the receiver or can't decode or even support them. IF the machine could do what Lenovo advertised maybe they should take a few moments to train the support staff or possibly make sure they ship what they advertise and that it works!!!!!<br />After 5 days of calls and hours on the phone with Lenovo support they told me they couldn't figure it out and I could return the model to Amazon (great-wait 30 days for my money before I can replace the machine) or I could be transferred to software support where I would have to pay to fix a problem that was shipped to me (if they could figure it out).<br />Lenovo - \\\\\"advertise what your product does, and when it doesn't you can pay again to fix their lemon computer\\\\\". This might be a great business model IF IT WASN'T ILLEGAL.<br />Lenovo should be ashamed - conducting business in such a shoddy manner.

I've learned how important it is to have a clean screen before applying the screen protector so I take a lot of care in cleaning the screen and making sure its oil and lint free.  For the last step in cleaning I use rubbing alcohol and then the lint free cloth.  So, the screen is pristine and I pick up the Cellet Screen Guard.  I read the instructions and the remove layer mask 1.  As I'm removing layer mask 1 I feel the hair on my arms standing up from all of the static it's creating.  When I get the mask off I notice that the \\\\\"sticky\\\\\" side of the Screen Guard is now covered in lint and who knows what!  I swear it must have pulled every fragment of lint from the air and every surface for a distance of ten feet!  Needless to say things just got worse from there.  I was finally able to get the majority of the lint off the Screen Guard by holding it over the sink and pouring the rubbing alcohol al over it.  After nearly an hour screwing around with it I was able to get it applied with only about a dozen bubbles. Then came time to pull off mask 2.  Of course when I tried to carefully remove that mask it pulled up every edge I just spent many minutes trying to get down.  OK, enough of the whining.  My suggestion to you is to purchase a better screen protector than this.  If I find one I will repost.",

My browser is forever freezing as is the picture gallery/editor, skype, and some other stuff. I have uninstalled and then redownloaded ALL of my downloads that are forever freezing and I keep my plug ins updated - still it freezes on me constantly. I asked for advice from my brother in law whom is a computer engineer and he said I would need to completely uninstall windows 7 and then re-install it again. WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!<br /><br />Last week the letter \\\\\"L\\\\\" on my keyboard fell of for no reason! I was typing away and BAM it just fell off? I am still able to use the letter but it's a pain in the butt because I can't breeze through when typing for words that need the letter \\\\\"L\\\\\" - instead I have to bang down on it to get it to work which is super annoying.<br /><br />The speed of this computer is nice though but when it freezes up then everything else does too and I have to restart my computer or it will continue doing so.

If it were just a cosmetic problem, I might have let it slide -- although, when paying almost $50 for what is essentially two pieces of plastic, I would expect something that doesn't look like factory seconds. However, the hardened drop is just high enough to keep the MacBook from closing properly and actually pushed the lip of the top shell up and, I fear, eventually off.<br /><br />Let's hope this will be resolved between Amazon and the reseller quickly. When it does, I will revise my review accordingly.

For starters we tried to get this thing to recognize the the sign language alphabet. The problem we were having is that leap motion has absolutely terrible hand tracking capabilities (we were using the version 2.0.4 of the API). The device will often think you are using your left hand instead of your right and it will think fingers are closed into your palm even when they are fully extened. To make this worse there is considerable &#34;jitter&#34;  in the tracking even when you hand is completely still. I sympathize with the developers of this device. I understand that the problem they are trying to solve (proper tracking without gloves) is really really hard, but If the solution is barely usable, don't make some stupid promo video that makes the device look amazingly accurate! The developers KNEW this thing had crappy tracking capabilities yet their main selling point is the accuracy of the tracking! This product is a scam.",

Firstly, it is heavy but it is a desktop replacement and I expected that.     Secondly, finding a case to fit it is hard because it is about an inch wider and longer than most 17.3 inch notebooks.     Thirdly, the CD-DVD drive is in an awkward position. Every time I pick up the computer I accidently open the tray and I have to pop it closed again.     Thirdly, I tend to rest my hands on the side of the touchpad when I type. I have never had a problem with any other computer. But this touchpad is extremely sensitive and it will interfere with using the computer. I also noticed that when the touchpad is on I will lose letters in words when typing. I will type all the letters but the computer will skip so I have to go back to correct. This does not happen when I use a mouse and turn off the touchpad.    Lastly and most importantly, it is difficult to get someone on the line at ASUS customer service. I had a problem with the charging plug and have to return the computer for repair. I have to go through the usual dance with automated answering. But when I am waiting to talk to a real person on my cellphone, I get cut off every time. I have never had a problem with my cell phone and it is consistently doing it when I am on the phone with ASUS. So I got on a landline and had to wait almost 20 minutes just to talk to a person. Then, when I did he said he had to wait a few minutes while his system came back on. (This is a computer company rep. telling me he is having problems with his system - which I find frustrating and ironic.) I gave him my service no. and he had no information on me, this after he had to keep putting me on hold for some reason. Keep your serial number handy since they keep asking for it every time you call.    Would I buy this product again if I knew then what I know now? Probably because it is wickedly fast and works great. But Iwould take every precaution to never have to deal with customer service from ASUS.    ***UPDATE: I have had this computer for four months and I have had to return it twice for the same thing. The pin in the charger plug came out with the AC charger and I could not recharge the computer. I had not been rough with the unit and, although inconvenienced, I returned it to Asus for repair and replacement of the AC charger. Well, got it back and two weeks later the exact same thing happened again. I was just pulling the plug of the AC charger out and the pin came with it again! I am sending it in to Asus AGAIN with a complaint about how delicate the charger pin is. I don't know if they will charge me for this second repair but I am furious at having to go through this with a $1700 computer. I have been working with computers since 1989 and never had this problem. I suspect the pin is much too thin and breaks easily. Now I may have to pay for a repair. I have revised my opinion of this computer and would NOT purchase it again! It is not worth the trouble.",

Then after about a month, the router would start randomly lagging on the wireless interface every 20 min or so. I could ping the router and see a build up in return delays. This would persist for a few minutes and then it would go back to being a great router. I tried every available firmware I could find, but after attempting to re-configure everything I could think of, I called customer service. They proceeded to ask the same questions I had already considered (have you tried turning it off and on again?) and after I described all of the steps that I took, they agreed that they thought it was a hardware issue and offered to RMA it (I had to pay for shipping).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the router they sent back to me was worse than the first I had received! Multiple devices were unable to connect to it over WPA protected 2.4Ghz and I can see (with a spectrum analyzer mobile app) that the signal is dropping precipitously as I go to the next room. I have an OLD D-link DIR-600 that is getting better coverage around my house.<br /><br />The worst part is that I contacted customer service again to explain that I was having issues with the unit they sent me. After talking on the phone with someone for ~ 1 hour, they agreed again that it looked like a hardware issue (I'm not sure they have any actual idea what they're talking about except for the script they have) and gave me another RMA. I told them I didn't want to pay for shipping again and they hooked me up with free shipping (only good thing that I've experienced with customer support). I just received the &#34;repaired&#34; unit, and all they did was reset the device! No info about what they think was the culprit, or why and it doesn't work any better than before!<br /><br />If I could give this back and get my money back I would do it in a second. It's been nothing but trouble - I can't evenimagine what it would be like to purchase a laptop or some other expensive device from them. If you're thinking about buying from asus, I would just suggest googling &#34;asus customer support&#34; and looking at other reviews.

Here's a list of things that were wrong with it:<br /><br />1.) Color: This wasn't a deal breaker for me. I ordered the teal blue like the picture. It was supposed to have two tones of teal. The one I got was all one color and a light blue. Again, not a deal breaker...<br />2.) Smell: It was putrid. I figured it must be the new faux-leather smell. Again, I'm sure over time this would go away. Still not a deal breaker so let's put my nook in.<br />3.) Damage: On the inside there was a small scuff a little bigger than a hole punch. They fixed it by globbing some mismatched paint on top of the scratch. Not a deal breaker because my nook would cover it.<br />4.) Fit: I could tell immediately that my nook wasn't going to fit. It did... sort of? I got it in, put the straps over and noticed that the bottom thread was unraveling. Very disappointing. I figured I would have a good few months from this... STILL not a deal breaker (Very generous, eh?)<br />5.) Closure: Finally, I check to see if the clasp would close. Nope. The flimsy magnet wouldn't close all the way!

When it works it works great I get full signal throughout my office and I get great speeds. The only issue is that almost every day it will not allow my devices to connect to its network. My iPad, iPhone, and laptop all have issues connecting. They keep trying to connect and are never able to. One of my desktops also gets issues and loses its connection. Some times I have issues connecting new devices to the network. After I turn off the access point my wifi network starts working normally again. Then I need to turn the booster back on for it to start functioning properly. And the next day the device will give me issues again.<br /><br />I have contacted technical support about this so I will see if they are able to give me a solution. Until then I do not recommend this product because it will not consistently work. It needs to be constantly restarted which basically makes this useless.",

If Razer would get its act together, it would not be getting two negative reviews from the same customer in the same time-frame.  As I said in the other review, it serves me right for continuing to purchase products from a company that has provided me with so many frustrating experiences.<br /><br />The original, wired Naga, was a real treat for me.  As I said in my other review, Razer's products provide this immediate, out-of-box satisfaction.  That, to sound like a paranoid old hobo, is how they get you.<br /><br />As a google search will very likely show you, plus another couple of reviews on Amazon, the left and right mouse buttons seem unusually prone to failure.  The brand new one I had, this was, indeed, the case, but it was sporadic enough that I didn't consider replacing it.  After all, I'd bought it new and it wasn't cheap.  I was mostly able to deal with it.  Then, the thing slows down.  The cursor wasn't following along.  Next thing I know, the whole thing is dead.  And two months outside of warranty, of course.<br /><br />Now, the thing didn't last very long, considering the price, but the reason this is a 1 star review is simple.  I decided it was time to replace it, and saw that Razer was selling these, refurbished.  I jump on it.  Free, two-day shipping yields me nothing for five days before I contact Amazon.  The order just stalled.<br /><br />Now, people can talk a lot of guff about Lasership, and I'll admit, while I haven't had a bad experience, personally, a lot of people obviously have, so it could have been them.  However, though Amazon squared things away quickly enough, Lasership seemed to indicate that they'd never received the item to ship, in the first place.<br /><br />I got comped one-day shipping and, today, I receive my refurbed Naga.<br /><br />Dirty.  Greasy finger-print on the left button, no teflon slider on the bottom.  Didn't come with the stickers my original came with (good for finding your place on a twelve button thumb pad) which the product info did not make clear.<br /><br />The kicker, though?  No serial number.  I read a review of this thing and someone else said they got a filthy, beat-up mouse with no serial number.  Honestly, even with what Razer's put me through, I couldn't believe that.  Then, I received the exact same thing!<br /><br />I'm not even plugging it in.  What's the point?  Without a serial number, once Amazon's return policy wears on, Razer doesn't owe me a thing.  Without a serial number, I can't even count on a 90-day.  And, given the Naga's track record, that doesn't seem like a remotely safe bet.<br /><br />This quality of service and assembly just KILLS me.  Razer's ideas are awesome.  The Naga proved a useful tool, for everything from MMOs, shooters, even macros for work.  The Naga even helped me file my taxes a little faster.  But the experiences I've had from Razer are inexcusable at any price, let alone the somewhat steep prices they charge.<br /><br />The worst part is?  I'm still considering maybe trading this thing in for a Naga 2012.  I heard they improved its durability and corrected some defect issues.  That's how good the Naga is, and that's why it's such a shame that they can't get their house in order.<br /><br />Once you try their stuff, you'll wind up like me, coming back for the same abuse, year after year.

I was using D-Link DI-713P for last year and half, before it died last week when I upgraded its firmware so it won't lock up whenever I accessed internet using Windows XP. I decided to buy DI-614+ model hoping it will work better than the old one but on the contrary, I had so much trouble in setting it up that I thought I was going insane. For any changes in setup, I had to reboot my cable modem, wait two mins, reboot D-Link router, reboot my computer(BTW, I was told by tech support to do this). It drove me nuts. To top it off, the range of wireless was extremely bad. I consistently lost signal, downstairs from my office, in living room just 30-35 feet away. The admin GUI was complicated and any time it rebooted the router, I had to go through the whole reboot sequence. I called tech support, the front line tech support guy was a novice. I am a computer professional, not really a network professional but I knew much more networking than him. Later, I got a call from &quot;supposedly&quot; higher line of tech support, woman had nothing else to offer except resetting the router and see if that worked.<BR>LinkSys and Microsoft wireless routers also suffer from poor wireless signals. I didn't even bother trying Microsoft router when I read about its locking up problem. Linksys' poor wireless range, though not as bad as D-Link was also unacceptable. <BR> I had almost lost hope in all the wireless devices on the market before I used Netgear's MR-814. It has user friendly gui and various options to make the network and wireless access secure. Over that, you don't have to worry about rebooting all the devices to make any change. Its signals are great, and I am totally impressed.<BR>My suggestion, don't even bother looking at other routers. I would hate to see others get frustrated trying to make other products work, like I did.",

The product arrived with Cisco ASA version 7.2 installed which is quite old.  This is the version release history for the product: 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 so it not like it was just one version. One has to migrate from 7.2, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 in that order.  Missing several updates, it is very frustrating to be face with maintenance work right out the box.

Meaning the product basically ships in an unsecure state. I am not willing to put the device online without it being fully patched.    I called Cisco several times about using the devices warranty period to get updated firmware so the product would be fully patched. Cisco would not do this.

Honestly, those guys do not care.  At one point I was asked for the size of my annual IT budget.    I eventually bailed on the idea of getting phone-email support and looked at getting a Cisco SmartNet so I could get the updates myself. They are not free downloads.  This is unbelievably expensive.

I transferred 2.5TB of movies, television shows and songs.  I wanted to be able to access my information without having to leave my computer powered on.<br /><br />I tried to access my information off my network and noticed that my computer was not recognizing the drive.  So after about 45 minutes of fiddling with the program, I powered down the drive according to the directions.  After the drive powered down, I turned it back on.  Nothing.  Just 7 red flashes.<br /><br />I looked on Buffalo's product forum and was informed that this was a problem with the internal controller card.  And that it was not communicating with the drive.  This left a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.<br />I looked at their warranty information; all returns in the first year must be through the store of purchase.  I know that Fry\u2019s would just swap out the return and I could wave goodbye to 5 years of data on my drive (the joke is they want you to use this drive as a backup).  I went to Fry\u2019s to confirm the bad news.  And it was exactly as I feared.  They suggested I contact Buffalo.<br /><br />I called Buffalo who referred me to DriveSavers.  Now this didn\u2019t sound good.  DriveSavers is a data recovery company.  You know, you dropped your laptop in a lake and after fishing it out a week later, they can pull the data off your destroyed drive.  My problem was simple, the controller on the enclosure was defective.  My data was sitting right there all warm and cozy.  There was no need to restore the data.  DriveSavers wanted to charge me $700 to $2700 to \u201crestore\u201d my data.<br /><br />I called Buffalo once more.  I tried to ask if they would just repair the enclosure.  I was told that they do not repair enclosures.  That they would be happy to swap my product.<br /><br />Now, I may be cynical, but it seemslike that if their product fails after 21 days and they have a \u201crule\u201d that states they do not repair their product (in this case it would be easy to remove the drive from the bad enclosure and place it in a brand new working enclosure) then this happens a lot and it\u2019s a money loser.  Let me rephrase that so the slow witted (i.e. Buffalo Americas, Incorporated) can understand.  I have a business to make money.  I have a product that has a tendency to fail.  If I have to repair a large number of my products, I don\u2019t make money. So I make a rule, let\u2019s call it Caveat Emptor, to ensure I make money by not fixing bad products.<br />What the companies don\u2019t realize is that eventually there is a tipping point.  You eventually have enough customers who have bought their products and realize that customer service does not exist.  So what happens is they do not buy your product again.  And eventually, your company, like Blockbuster Videos, CompUSA, Best Buy\u2026just becomes irrelevant.",

I bought this laptop back in November, 2014, in preparation for the spring semester at school.<br /><br />My first complaint is the Samsung bloat-ware that came pre-installed on it. It wants me to upgrade their Samsung Smart Advisor software and hassles me almost every time I start up my machine to either pay to upgrade it or to buy some other product to &#34;upgrade for free&#34;. Next, I purchased an antivirus product when I bought the machine. Samsung continuously complains that I should buy &#34;their&#34; recommended antivirus even though I already have a product loaded. When I try to uninstall Smart Advisor, it automatically reinstalls itself. In addition, for a while, it complained that I had 2 antivirus products installed. Total pain in the a$$... well, neck.<br /><br />My next complaint is that the default screen resolution sucks. 3200 X 1800 might be fine if you have amazing vision and a magnifying glass handy. It may very well be a good size for watching videos if that is all you want to do with your laptop. Most things either don't fit well on the screen at all or they are so small as to be unreadable. If you try to adjust the resolution to any other available setting, it tells you that things will not fit properly on the display. So, why even give us the option to change it? Stupid.

If I could return this 'machine' right now, I would probably buy a Toshiba or a Sony.<br /><br />Another complaint I have is that one reason I bought this was because they said it had an amazing battery life. Up to 11 hours of actual use. I think if you cut that figure in half, it might be more accurate. If I take it anywhere, I carry along the power cord because I don't really trust it to work as long as I would like it to work on battery.<br /><br />Finally, I sit inside at a computer desk all week for my job. Part of the reason that I bought a laptop was with the idea that when possible I would use it while not stuck at a desk. If I wanted to sit at my desk to work, I would have bought another desktop PC. So, aside from the battery life, I am just going to say that the glare that comes off the screen when trying to work outside or even in a well lit room if absolutely horrible. I have been trying to shop for anti-glare filters. 3M does not make anything this small. I have yet to find a vendor that has an anti-glare filter that I can buy at this time. So, no sitting on the porch outside in the fresh air to work or at the park or really anywhere outside.<br /><br />If you are thinking about spending this much money, you might want to do some more research if this is a laptop you are considering buying.",

I can't say whether it's Windows 7 being clunky or whether screen typing just doesn't work out for me, but holding the Iconia in one arm and pecking at it with a $3 capacitive stylus feels a lot more comfortable. But use a regular-length stylus, not one of the short stubby ones.    Updates:   First, I have found that the SD card slot supports SDXC, allowing 64gb and 128gb upgrades.    Second, I tried out a Galaxy Tab 10.1 in a store, and it was slow too! Flash video took a while to load and didn't reorient correctly between portrait and landscape--just like in Windows.    My criticism and low rating remains, though, perhaps now expanded to Android tabs as well.    ***  Forget about the \\\\\"keydock\\\\\" contraption. Consider the W500 as a Windows tablet, able to pair with any USB or Bluetooth keyboard, or just resort to the wonky on-screen keyboard. And what have you got?    The greatest of all Netbooks, the least of all tablets.    There needs to be context. There have always been Windows tablets--questionable Archos tabs, overpriced UMPCs, and convertible tablets with swiveling screens. Aside from a few hot-rod $1,000 models, the Netbook-based Windows tabs like the Dell Inspiron Duo and Lenovo s10-3t have suffered from glacial sluggishness and cheap LCD screens whose poor viewing angles make actual tablet use a pain. Hold it wrong and the image turns blue!    But that's where the Tab W500 delivers. As a multitouch-based Windows 7 Netbook-tablet, it just works. Touch response is quick if not buttery smooth, finger-swipe scrolling works in Firefox and IE but not Chrome, and pinch-to-zoom...works on pictures but lags for websites. Now this screen--it's beautiful! Off-axis viewing angles are nearly perfect. The image is almost as stable as my smartphone, or an iPad.     That screen quality is a huge deal, and it means that if you're thinking about a Windows Netbook at all, the Iconia W500 is the ONLY way to getan excellent screen!.     But, as a tablet? The processor bogs down easily--one Flash video at a time, max--and battery life is insufficient for e-reader duty--4 hours of surfing, 2-3 hours of Flash video. It's also too blasted heavy to hold comfortably--two pounds for the tablet only. Compared to the iPad and slew of Android Tablets in its price range, the Iconia W500 cannot compete.    So the point of this computer is really just Windows 7--full document and spreadsheet editing, PDF editing if you buy software, regular desktop programs, full Web support, both Flash and Silverlight, two USB ports, USB printing, and a full-sized HDMI port for mirroring and extended desktop. It elevates the experience of a premium Netbook by adding touch input and great viewing angles.    The problem is, after spending two weeks with my new W500 tablet and writing half this review on its wonky ON-SCREEN keyboard, I'm still jealous for an iPad or any Android tab that runs Flash. Even with their limitations, mainstream tablets are very functional--focused, you might say--and they all have excellent battery life. This little touchbook is such a different machine, a traditonal computer that dressed up in a tablet costume, a jack-of-all-trades that excels at nothing, except for that screen. The Android tablets and iPad have a gravity to them, because they're designed to do fewer things but do them very well.    The bottom line? The W500 is for those looking for a Netbook, not a tablet. As a Windows machine, it's a decent Netbook with a bonus touch screen. As a tablet, it's too heavy and the battery life is nearly inexcusible.",

The W and CTRL keys started to become unresponsive.<br /><br />I notified Eliktronics, but they told me to call HP.  If you buy from Eluktronics, you better notice and notify them of any problems within 7 days or they absolve themselves of responsibility.  Fine.  HP sent out a box for me to send the laptop back to them in.<br /><br />The day before it arrived, Windows mysteriously crashed and failed to boot \\\\\"No OS Found\\\\\" -- no boot media, so no way to repair.  I spoke with HP again to update the trouble-ticket.  We clearly agreed that the issues were the mfg-defective screen, the keyboard, and now the SSD/HDD/OS.<br /><br />The brand-new computer was sent to HP; dead as a brick.  They were supposed to fix the three problems above.  What I received back, was a computer that was wiped clean, the OS installed on the 5400RPM HDD rather than on the SSD, a screen that was still leaking light because they never replaced or adhered the screen, and a keyboard was neither replaced nor fixed.<br /><br />Frustrated and tired of the irritation, I decided that this \\\\\"premier model\\\\\" was a lot less than, and that I will just bend over and deal with this POS for the next year or so and buy a different one -- that works.<br /><br />So, that being said, I had manually installed the SSD drivers, moved the OS from the HDD to the SSD and decide to just deal with having to make sure that W and CTRL key-presses take.

After speaking to 3 representatives I'm frustrated, annoyed and have a splitting headache but have no idea what they are sending me as a replacement... The first representative told me that they would send a new kindle right out to me, they just needed a credit card number to charge, if I did not return the broken fire and the the charge would be $199. I did not have my card with me so they said to call back and they would mark my account. Number 2 said that this problem was common in this model but it would be replaced with a new one not refurbished, I would be charged $199 if I didn't return my broken Fire and I could upgrade at an additional cost but first I needed to try the newer charger, so they sent it to me. It did not work. They did not call back as per their confirming email, so I called again.  Number 3 said I could upgrade, my warranty had expired but there was an extension because of the battery issue but now I only have one day left, to make my decision. I was then told I would probably receive a refurbished one with a 90 day warranty, but if I wanted to upgrade I could buy a refurbished upgrade with a 1yr. warranty or a new one at the regular price with my Fire as a trade in for $50-$100 and again I would be charged $199 if my fire was not returned!!! I asked for a Supervisor. Number 4 was a supervisor who said there was a misunderstanding with her people and she would speak with them, but couldn't offer me an explanation as what I would get for my  trade in so I asked the Supervisor how much I would be charged if the Fire was not returned so I could insure it and she told me that they would send me an insured mailing label for the return but I would still charged $199 if I don't return it (like I really wanted a broken Fire). Is Amazon going to charge the Post Office $199 if it's lost???? I have no idea what I'm receiving new or refurbished or what model Fire I'm getting so I took the replacement one in complete frustration and going out to look at the other Tablets with a better Customer Support.  I have never written this kind of review before but I had heard of the great customer service and support for the Fire from Amazon and can't believe that this is what I had to go through when all I wanted was a repair.",

Considering all the other computers are working properly in my apartment, including two other ASUS notebooks and a Fujitsu which uses the same model of LAN card, how can a reasonable person ever make such a conclusion?    Adorama's response was fast but helpless. In fact, they insisted that all the computers and notebooks bought from them can't be returned or exchanged once opened even if they are defective.    So, good luck shopping with Adorama or ASUS!    ============  update:    So previously I gave one star for this computer because of the wireless defection. After over a month's struggling, I finally got it connect to the internet. What I did is just changing some settings of wireless connection. Of course, there were times when this computer was not working properly offline with hardly being used and I had to recover the system at least twice. In order to do so, I had to buy an external DVD drive. Anyway, now it's working. Still feeling traumatized and frustrated with this experience, I can't give it more than 3 stars. If I, a common user, can fix the problem by simply clicking on some buttons, why the technique support staff at ASUS can't figure it out? Absolutely NOT recommend ASUS or Adorama.    ===========  update:    Last week I thought the internet problem was fixed. But after several days sitting on my desk without being used at all, today, when I really needed to do some research online, guess what? The wireless stopped working again!

I made this purchase for only two reasons, the Cherry MX Brown keys and the backlight, both of which are very important to me. I sent a message to the seller, AramediA, regarding what I assumed were non-functioning lights on the keyboard I received. They are very responsive and are contacting the manufacturer for clarification. However, after researching this issue in several places online, I find that only lower case characters are designed to be lighted on the keys with dual functions! Examples: top row: numeral 1 but not exclamation mark, etc.; second row: brace but not bracket, etc.; third row: semi-colon but not colon, etc.; bottom row: comma but not smaller-than symbol, etc.; and secondary functions on the number keypad. This does not work for me at all. My keyboard usage is primarily words, so I need to glance down for the lesser used characters - that Rosewill does not light up!<br /><br />In addition, to light the keyboard at all, one must complete a number of key combinations, and the same is true to change colors. As others herein have remarked, if you turn off your computer or the keyboard lights only, you have to go through all those annoying steps all over again. This doesn't work for me at all and the keyboard is virtually unusable to me! As a matter of fact, I unplugged and reboxed it after an hour's usage. Having been out of town when the keyboard was delivered, the 30-day return period for Amazon Prime had already been passed when I returned and opened the package. Now I have to figure out a way to sell it in order to recoup some of the $150.00 plus I spent on this product. Very disappointed. Rosewill missed the boat big time as far as I'm concerned.",

After looking various forums and failing at attempts of self-repair, I sent it in to Asus, and then after that it could switch on but the wireless was completely disabled.    So I called their service line. Their customer service is ATROCIOUS. You call and they put you on hold (which is fine, I can wait even an hour), but after 15 minutes, they hang up on you and you have to call in again. The line is also very bad (and my connection has worked fine with Skype, etc, so I believe the problem is on their side). I was put on hold for at least an hour today and spoke to 3 different reps, having to explain my problem again each time.     Their representative advised me to reboot windows (removing all my programs installed previously, and also making my version of MS office unable to work) which would be acceptable if the wireless started working, but it still does not. And so I have to send it in to Asus again.    I heard a lot of good things about Asus, but I really, really regret buying this laptop and really wish I could get a refund. It was a complete waste of time, money and effort. I bought it in Februrary this year but because I have been travelling in and out of the US, I still have not been able to use this laptop for even a few days, and had to buy another one to tide me over while I waited for Asus to get their act together (which is taking 7 months and counting).

I do like the level of curve as it is more pronounced than its competitors, Dell and LG.  I bought this monitor for gaming and would not use it for any type of work as the fonts are very difficult to read.  The gaming aspect would have been ok as the speed is good but the contrast levels expected out of a VA panel just aren't there.  I have asked for a return from the seller.  So far the seller has been very responsive as there has been a few other issues, like I had to complete the import paperwork through Federal Express to get the shipment out of customs.  Luckily that was no big deal as Federal Express was very helpful in completing the required FCC form 740.  The shipment was delayed about a week.  So much for paying for extra for expedited shipping.<br /><br />When I got the monitor it was missing a figure 8 US power cable.  I contacted the seller and after a few emails back and forth I finally got the cable about 2 weeks later.  In the time that passed till the time I was able to turn the monitor on the priced dropped on Amazon by $120.00.  I asked the seller for a refund of that amount since I could return the monitor and buy it again this time directly from Amazon using Prime.  The seller graciously agreed and refunded the $120.00.<br /><br />When you pay this kind of money for a monitor you expect to love it.  This monitor doesn't work properly because of the joystick issue and does not live up to its specs.  If it was the joystick alone I probably would have kept it.

But even with that you may have some difficulties to work through before it works perfectly.<br /><br />Getting a 2D 1080p picture working was reasonably easy and quick.  Follow the instruction manual and you'll have it working in minutes.<br /><br />Getting 3D to work was *much* more challenging (it's the most demanding since it needs to send double the data down the wire):  I've run 3 new Cat 6 cables through my walls for my home theater - each wire length is around 45 feet, so well within the working range of these devices.  Yet, while I was able to get a clean 3D picture out of a random 10 year old cheap 150ft cat 5 cable run across the floor that I had lying around, I could barely get any 3D picture through my installed wall wires.  Most of the time the picture blacked out entirely or had severe noise.  The wall wires terminate in Cat6 rated punch-down sockets and the HDMI cables on both ends are Amazon Basics High-Speed HDMI Cable 3 Feet (trying to keep the HDMIs as short as possible).  3D 1080p didn't reliably work on 2 of the 3 cable runs (even though they test fine with a basic continuity network cable tester) - and it just about hung on with the 3rd cable.<br /><br />You can get some idea of how much margin you have by how sensitive the setting is on receiving unit (it has an adjustable dial for &#34;EQing&#34; the signal - seems like a gain knob in actuality).  With the old 150ft direct cable, about 5 of the EQ receiver settings gave a picture with no defects.  Using the wall run wires, only 1 setting was mostly clean, and the settings on either side had bad break up.  I tracked the problem down to the punch-down wall sockets.  Stripping the wires of insulation and re-punched them again made no improvement.  Then I tried soldering the punch downs with a lot of flux and solder.  This improved the 3D pic stability noticeably, but next day it wouldn't work again...  I broke out my scope and sent test signals down - it seemed to perform fine.  Out of exasperation and options, I decided to pull the excess cable out of the wall and terminate it in a plug so I could plug the wall cable directly into both the send and receive units.  Then everything worked absolutely perfectly.  All 7 &#34;EQ&#34; settings on the receiver unit delivered a flawless picture.<br /><br />So, beware of using punch-down wall sockets with 3D - it really seems unable to handle the extra bandwidth required.  Using a keystone coupler instead of a punch-down socket did not improve things sufficiently well to work.  3D just about worked with a coupler on one end, but not the other.  Even then it wasn't solid, so you do need to have 1 continuous wire running end-to-end and nothing more.<br /><br />If you're running wires yourself, I'd obviously recommend leaving plenty of slack in the walls to give the option of continuing the same cable out to wherever you need it to plug into.

Having a small child around the house I had not had the chance to crank these pups up 'til this morning, but when I finally did, lets just say I was not too happy.  I've owned the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 and also a Logitech 5.1 PC speaker system that was about half the price of this Bose setup, and both of those can attain higher volume levels with much less distortion.  The reason I had been considering keeping these until this morning was because as I stated earlier I had only been listening to them at a low to moderate volume.  At those volumes I had heard the \\\\\"tinnyness\\\\\" people mention in their reviews but only on a few songs and I was actually impressed at how a few songs sounded.  I tried watching a movie and could not discern any sort of surround sound, this is because I'm using them in a pretty open area and I'm figuring the surround requires walls to bounce the sound off but I didn't buy them for their gimmickey \\\\\"5.1\\\\\" claim so that didn't really bother me.  Anyway, back to the music, the reason I bought these speakers.  When I finally got around to cranking them up, all the tin in those satellites started attacking my ears with a vengance, this coupled with the voices now coming out of the bass module was quite enough to send these suckers right back to their packaging.  Perhaps if all you do is play games and watch movies (without music) these speaks will be acceptable, of course if thats all you're doing I think you would have just bought the ProMedias and not the Bose, thats what I would have done.  I cannot recommend these speakers to those who listen to or create music.",

I have a decent phone and didn't feel like lugging around a tablet and I don't like backlit LCD e-readers for extended reading. I figured I'd get something that'd make all my e-books like hardbacks and make reading tables and newspapers easier and considering the amount of time I spend reading with kids, by myself, studying, etc. I was willing to pay a premium to improve that experience, but the price was awfully steep and now I really regret this purchase even though I took care of the e-reader. It's been out the Amazon cover probably 10 minutes since I took it out of the box.<br /><br />Anyway, here's the transcript of my conversation with their chat support.

I was pretty pleased with it as an e-reader but it seems like the DX may be a bit of a pumpkin.<br />Amazon:Kindle, 6\\\\\" E Ink Display, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers (Graphite) for $54.<br />Certified Refurbished Kindle Touch, Wi-Fi, 6\\\\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers for $74.<br />Certified Refurbished Kindle Touch 3G (ATT),Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6\\\\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers for $104<br />These three are the available models.<br />Me:So, by returning the DX I get about $20 in value?<br />Amazon:Unfortunately, that is correct.<br />You can get DX for replacement for $223<br />Me:It's usable at the moment but I'm worried it's getting worse. No thanks, I'll take my chances. I'm not going to be rude but I don't intend on buying any other e-Readers from Amazon at this point.<br />Save the customer service nonsense.<br />Amazon:I understand how you feel James. I am sorry for this.<br />What I can do from my end is give you $15 promotional credit to your account which you can use on next purchase.<br />Me:Do I have to send in the Kindle?<br />Amazon:Yes James, you would be required to send old one back.<br />Me:Alright, logging off now before I get more than blunt.<br />Amazon:I am sorry for this James. this is not intended to cause you more trouble.

            "input": "Final Update 6: I have dropped the rating to a 1 star, while the specs may be nice, you can get better spec'ed laptops for about the same price. They will probably last you a lot longer. I've had 2 warranty repairs in the first year of ownership and now the reliability has taken another hit, where the graphics card likes to crash on occasion, even after installing different drivers and such. I finally attempted a Windows 7 re-install and things seem to be running ok, though with 1 crash since the redo it makes me question it,but I haven't really used it too much as I NEED reliability. So I ended up getting a new Laptop. Better spec'ed and better built by far. Plus it was a little cheaper. Samsung also seems to have abandoned the Gamer series as there has been no Haswell refresh of the Gamer Series, where Asus, Alienware, even Toshiba has done refreshes and everything. When I bought this laptop, I expected it to last me at least 2 years, if not longer as the specs where higher than I needed at the time. (I expect this out of all laptops I buy. Since I tend to buy while thinking ahead.) Instead, it's been about a year and 3 months. It's now out of warranty, and I will not spend ANYMORE money on this laptop. It's just not worth it since the reliability is the most important thing to me and it's the one thing in question.<br /><br />With all these updates I CANNOT recommend this laptop with the reliability issues I have had. To be fair I probably got a lemon, but also with everything else newer that has come out I can't recommend it. With this being said I will not be doing any more updates until it actually dies. (Even then it may be awhile before I update it as it's not at the top of my todo list.) I am still a student, and almost done with classes, but still use the computer for so much more. I can't have reliability issues. I have owned Asus before this and while I've had small issues here and there. They were ALWAYS fixable, but when primary parts fail like in this one. (Cpu first time, gpu second time and now maybe a third time and it's no longer under warranty.)<br /><br />Will this marks the end of this part, read on for the whole shebang, but this is the most up to date one.<br /><br />Update 5: I received my laptop back on June 14th (2013) after about 2 weeks of waiting. (This includes shipping it to them, which cost me another $50) It is running like new again. I added a star since the repair went pretty quick and seems good. I may add 1 more star if this lasts longer than that last repair (which was in November, so it was like 7 months.) I won't be giving 5 stars no matter what as this issue has soured my thoughts on Samsung now. (And I think I may be generous with the 4 stars, but I am also keeping in mind I may have gotten duds.) Again, 2 repairs in less than a year? It makes me question the lifespan of the laptop. Performance wise it's great, but it may go bad again, only time will tell and if it happens I will be completely re-writing my review from scratch. I really, really want to love this laptop, but it's becoming harder to do so.<br /><br />Update 4: This is a minor update to Update 3 (Below): They have pushed my Estimated repair date twice now. Originally it was going to be done on June 4th, then it got pushed to June 10th. Now it's been pushed to June 11th. (They are probably waiting on a replacement part.) But this is just not good. I have docked another star due to the issues. It is making it harder and harder to suggest buying this laptop. I really WANT to love it, and for the specs you can't go wrong. But the issues I am having is just a big issue when it comes to making me wonder about longevity. I bought this laptop to last me for a long time, and now as stated later, I have had to send it in 2x in less than a year for repairs. Almost $100 more for shipping it. The brand Samsung, has always been the name of a great, wonderful and quality product to me. Now I am really starting to wonder if they have left me like other brands have. I am just glad I picked up an Asus G46 for under $700 at Best Buy so that I could still do my schoolwork and play games. I anxiously await getting my Samsung back, if only to have the horsepower again, and will just hope that all the delays allow them to really make sure that it is in full working order. If that happens and I don't need to send it in again, ever, I will restore this to a 5-star despite the issues, I'll know that Samsung still takes care of their customers. (I'm really hoping things will be great so I can do so. :)<br /><br />UPDATE 3: I had to send my laptop in again for repair! This is starting to get ridiculous! I paid almost $2000 for a laptop that was suppose to last me a long time. (I bought it for gaming and so that even if the games started getting a little more advanced I figured that for the power it would last me awhile. But now after having ownership for about 10 months and needing to send it in twice now it's just mounting up to be even more expensive! It cost almost $50 to ship it both so add another almost $100 to the price I paid! I am now docking 2 stars from the perfect 5 stars I gave it. I understand things can go wrong, but twice in 1 year, scratch that less than a year? I'm sorry but this is drawing the line. I'm just hoping they will give me a whole new laptop instead. I don't know what else to say, I really want to love the laptop, it's great for the price and specs. But I'm questioning the purchase now. It's not about warranty service or the laptop itself, it's lifetime of the product, and I expected more than a year. I will update once I get my laptop back.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: I recently had to send my laptop in for a repair. The cpu fan seemed to not be working properly and it would overheat when running almost all my games. Fortunately it is still in warranty. I sent it about 3 days before Thanksgiving and due to The holiday it didn't get there until Monday following Thanksgiving. They repaired it. (Seems the replaced the motherboard, gpu and the keyboard. (I now have a Windows 8 style keyboard where the Start key isn't the older orb shape but is the newer windows logo) All in all, it took about 2 weeks due to holiday to get my laptop back. Which isn't really bad considering I live in Ohio and had to ship it all the way to Texas. I shipped via UPS ground with insurance (I am paranoid about that stuff.) Samsung shipped it back with 2 day Air. I was able to track both ways and knew when it would be coming so I was ready for it. The fix is good! Now I no longer overheat. Now I think that my issue was just a fluke as I don't see many with the issue, so I'm not taking any stars away and would in fact add a star for good customer support if I could. I still recommend this laptop. As you still get a good bang for your buck.<br /><br />UPDATE: Other have written that you can't turn down the brightness if you run the screen at 120Hz. This HAS been fixed! Download the latest video drivers from nvidia Geforce 310.33 beta or later and you CAN adjust the brightness level while on 120Hz. I already tried it with 310.33 beta and can confirm it works. Nvidia has also released another beta (310.54)today (November 12th, 2012) that I have yet to try, but can for sure say that the beta 310.33 works fine. So anyone who wants to adjust their brightness while on 120Hz, you can do so!<br /><br />On to the review now.<br /><br />I've owned quite a few gaming laptops, The Asus G73JH (I still have that one as a backup), Asus G53SW (I sold to get this one) are the closest in comparison. Though they are still decent gamer laptops. This one blows those out of the water. I have owned mine for close to 2 months now and don't have much to gripe about.<br /><br />Comparisons (These are comparing the differences of the Asus's and this Samsung one):<br /><br />* Asus used crappy Atheros Wifi cards in their laptops (I had to upgrade to in Intel card for better wifi. This one had an Intel init already, I expected to have to change the wifi.<br />* Both My Asus's cost a max of $1,200 but after upgrading the ram and adding a second hard drive as will as upgrading the wifi + any labor expenses they each cost as much as this Samsung.<br />* All the laptops have a big rear. That's good for the cooling. 2 exhausts 1 is for the cpu and 1 is for the gpu. All laptops win in this category.<br />* The Asus's felt a little cheaper built than this Samsung.<br />* The Asus's Keyboards are of the chiclet style, this Samsung one offers something a little more traditional and feels great! A note on the G53SW and from what I have been reading all the<br />  latest Asus Gamers seems to be a keyboard lag at times. When you type sometimes it would skip letters. This drove me crazy on the G53SW. To the point I ended up only using it's keyboard for<br />  when I was in class. Not the case on the Samsung gamer. Typing is a dream.<br />* I can't really compare specs since I'd be comparing 1-3 year old tech to now. But I'm a gamer, music maker, photo editor and video editor (student in the last 2) and this laptop has yet to<br />  disappoint in any of the categories. What I thought was an awesome gaming experience on my other laptops was nothing!<br /><br />Negatives:<br />I don't have much to gripe about and have been very happy with this laptop but if I would have to nitpick:<br /><br />* The glossy screen lid and screen are finger print magnates. Though a lot of manufactures use that stuff. It would have been nice to have a anti glare screen at least. But I'm used to it.<br />  Considering I do a weekly cleaning and dusting of my laptops it doesn't bother me too much. I knew it would be this way by other reviews so I really can't gripe since I still bought it<br />  knowing.<br />* If you go to turn off Wifi with the shortcut button it turns off both wifi and bluetooth. It would have been nice to cycle or something like that. But I hardly use this function so it isn't a<br />  big deal to me.<br />* The power brick is large, so get a large bag for it. I'm used to large power bricks as the Asus gamers had large ones, so I can't complain on this. Ideally I would love a small power brick<br />  but think about how much power this laptop needs. The power brick is a 200W one. My Asus's were 150W.<br /><br /> On to any other thoughts:<br /><br />This laptop does get warm when under heavy use. But it's never been so hot that I can't touch it. It's to be expected. Look what's in it. The I73610 ivy bridge is comparable to one of the most powerful mobile i7 sandybridge's (last generation) The gpu is comparable to a Desktop GTX 560 (I believe but don't quote me on that). frankly I'm astounded at how well this laptop stays cool. Warm laptops aren't new to me as I've had gamer laptops before. But honestly this one actually is a little cooler. I use coretemp and msi afterburner to monitor the temps of the cpu and gpu respectively and they have been cooler than my older machines.<br /><br />I love the backlighting and how it changes colors for gaming mode. You can disable the screensavers that start up when you switch to gamer mode. It's under Mode Shift, then click Visual Effects.<br /><br />I like the design and coloring, it doesn't really scream \\\\\"I'm a gaming laptop!\\\\\" Unless you put stickers or stuff all over the lid. I wanted something I could potentially use for taking to a job someday that still had a lot of power and this works fine for that. The samsung label on the lid lights up like the Apple logo lights up on macbooks. Just as a side note.<br />The 8GB Express Cache seems to work. I really can't tell other than things seem to run a little faster and boot up isn't bad. Better than my other laptops.<br /><br />The screen is a vibrant one. I've always liked Samsung TV's for their screens and the screen on this laptop doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Battery runs for about 2 hours on normal use. Not much to write about. The battery is powering alot of powerful components.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />One heck of a laptop, you get what you pay for, and that is a lot of bang! You could pay more for an Alienware or such and not get as good of specs (I know because I priced them at the time I bought this machine some were as high as $1000 more!) This is one heck of a machine and you can't go wrong with it. I've been happy and surprised at how will it performs, yeah I'm still getting surprised 2 months after I bought it.<br /><br />Notes:<br />I wish to put the specs of my old laptops up for comparison to this one.<br /><br />Asus G73JH<br />17.3\\\\\" 1600x900 display<br />Core i7 740QM 1.73GHZ turbo to 2.93GHZ<br />8GB DDR3 Ram<br />500GB 7200rpm and 640GB 5400rpm drives<br />Intel Wifi and bluetooth<br />Ati Radeon HD 5870m 1GB GDDR5<br /><br />Battery gets 1.5 hours if I'm lucky on normal use.<br /><br />Asus G53SW (Sold to buy the Samsung)<br />15.4\\\\\" 1920x1080<br />Core i7 2630QM 2GHZ turbo to 2.9GHZ<br />14GB DDR3 Ram (upgraded by me)<br />2x 500GB 7200rpm drives (2nd drive added by me)<br />Intel 6230 Wifi and bluetooth (upgraded by me)<br />Nvidia GTX 460M 1.5GB GDDR5<br /><br />Games I played on ALL machines: Torchlight, Command and Conquer Kane's Wraith, Sims 3, and Minecraft.

It hasn't worked since day one. My mother was told to buy it by CenturyLink customer service when we started having internet problems back in march--since buying it and setting it up our problems have only escalated. The modem disconnects from the internet every 5-15 minutes every hour, all hours of the day, every single day. We've put in new ethernet cables, new filters, upgraded firmware, had the telephone company come out and inspect the wiring to and in our house. I've tried manually selecting the channel, like a few other people suggested--nothing works!<br /><br />On the few occasions it stays connected for longer than 15 minutes don't expect good speeds. Just trying to watch a youtube video on two connected devices causes latency to spike ~2400 ms (I'm seriously have flashbacks to my dial-up internet but that would at least stay reliably connected even if it was slow).<br /><br />Don't buy this modem, ESPECIALLY from CenturyLink because they will charge you about 3x as much for it.<br /><br />Waste of money, waste of time, nothing but frustration.<br /><br />Just while I was typing this (rather short) review my internet kicked off and I had to wait to get it back so I could even post this.<br /><br />#TerribleLink",

According to Dell the onboard video does not need to be disabled. I insterted the new card, reconnected the video cable to the new adapter. Windows loaded a plain VGA driver. I then used the CD to to do the driver update. Windows took almost 20 minutes to reboot. When it did I got a black screen. I rebooted again and checked the BIOS. The bios fonts were almost unreadable. I checked to see if the PCI Express card was recognized. It was. I finished rebooting, and still a black screen. Then I got the - failure to start- Vista repair screen. The NVIDIA instructions suggest that the screen is caused when the onboard controller is not disabled either in the BIOS or in Windows. At this point I skipped further tinkering to find out if I could get the system running at all. I did. So then I started all over again, but this time disabled the onboard video adapter in Windows (this was a mistake). I got another black screen when I put the new card back in. Frustrated I pulled the card out, reset the cables, rebooted the computer and found that Windows would not load at all. I had to shut off the power supply to shut the compter down. This prompted windows to start it's system repair tool for which I was eventually asked if I wanted to use a previous restore point. Finally back to normal  The next day, I tried again. This time I let Windows updated the NVIDIA driver via the web. But no luck.   One moral is make a system restore point before you tackle this.    When I booted up with the NVIDIA card inserted properly etc, I noticed a pinhole pattern spread across the inital Windows Logo. The fonts in the bios are almost unreadable.

The 45 samples points are grossly inadequate.  Also, after creating a profile, there is no way to edit or correct it.  You either have to live with what comes out, reprofile (timing consuming when you allow adequate ink drying time), or abandon your purchase in favor of the original printer manufacturer's profile.  This tool is so bad that it guarantees that you will need to spend an additional $400 each to upgrade to Gretag-Macbeth's standard CYMK and RGB profiling modules.<br /><br />Even after spending another $400 each, do not expect profiling to go easily.  The blacks can block-up, your black and whites will not stay neutral throughout the gray scale, and the gamut can suffer.  Most of these are correctable, but they require time, patience, and some ability to edit profiles (not included with the package).  The provided instructions are minimal -- be prepared to spend hours with tech support and/or reading a book on the subject (such as Bruce Fraser's color management book).<br /><br />The advertising falsely promises an upgrade path; however, if you price it out, the upgrades from Eye1-Design to Eye1-Photo are more expensive than buying Eye1-Photo outright.

You'll have it on your menu but won't be able to access it.  This is a critical limitation -- you're denied the ability to view or edit your profiles.  Viewing is essential so you can compare your weekly profile updates and detect when an anomalous profile has been generated (this WILL happen from time to time).  Without profile viewing, you're left to detect the profile variance by eye.  Without profile editing, there is no way to correct systematic errors (perhaps your monitor's red phosphors fall near the dividing line between two sample intervals).<br /><br />GMB's tech support team is knowledgeable and helpful. However, they've advised me that all of the packages under $2,000 are considered entry level products -- the company stays focused on it printshop and graphic design clients who spend $5,000 or more on GMB products.

When connected it feels as though it will come unplugged easily.  Poor fit and finish.<br /><br />Next, I have it setup and am trying to record for the first time.  I am managing the camera in my Web browser and click the Record button.  I am prompted to specify the location and name of the file.  I accept the defaults (the Documents folder, with a defaulted name).  I let it record for a few minutes and then click the Record button again (presumably to stop the recording process).  When I look for the file, it's just not there.  So I click Record again and it shows me the *previous* file name in the Documents folder -- like that file is there.  I try to right-click and copy that file, then paste it somewhere else, but when I do I get a Windows error saying that the file no longer exists.  Somehow the dialog box things it does.  So I try the recording process again with the same result.  No dice.  Over and over again, in different locations from different computers, no dice.  I have no resolution at the moment.<br /><br />I then tried to update the firmware and cannot find a firmware update file for this camera.  At one point I am redirected to the Foscam support site, and the model numbers and firmware update numbers sent to me in an e-mail (after registering on that site) don't match my camera.  I am still unsure how to obtain a firmware update file, or if that will fix the recording problem.<br /><br />The tech support Chat feature is offline.  It's 2:00 PM ET on a Friday.<br /><br />The documentation is skimpy and has not been any help yet.  There isn't even any instruction on how to perform video recording.<br /><br />It only cost $50, but I am considering returning it and trying something else.  You get what you pay for, I suppose.<br /><br />All in all, I think I would give another brand a try.  Ihave used a D-Link camera in the past, and at least its stated features worked.

I purchased this unit in Septerber 2002.  Very easy to set up, great browser-based interface.  I have past experience with the Netgear MR314 and the FM114P is more user friendly and less flaky.  No problems getting the print server to work.  Great wireless signal strength with the stock antenna.  Ran it continually for a year. <br />Then BANG, one day it died.<br />Called tech support, got right on (no holding!), very friendly but a bit hard to understand (from India).  They did some trouble shooting.  Nothing worked.  I got the old &quot;My manager will have to call you back.&quot;  I thought &quot;Great, how long will that take.&quot;  Got a call back in 3 minutes.  Got my Return Material Authorization (RMA) without any argument, and I hope to have a new unit in a couple days.  They also have a nice feature where for a couple extra bucks, they will express mail you a new unit, with a postage paid box, and then you mail back in the dead one after you get the new one.<br />Unfortunately, they will be sending me another FM114P.  It seems like these things are good for about 6 to 12 months then they die.  Netgrear should really discontinue this model and offer an upgrade or replacement with a model that does not have the same design problems. But great tech support, great capabilities, and high marks from a user-interface and capabilities standpoint.",

This is my biggest complaint because you cannot drag and drop files, move windows around on screen, or use scroll bars.  It is not an issue of RF interference, as the remote never misses a keystroke or mouse click, it just can't drag on screen items properly.  -The thing tears through batteries.  In three months of extremely light HTPC use I have already had to replace the batteries twice.  Tried Duracells and Energizers with the same results.  Only going a month and a half with almost no use is pretty poor, considering my main keyboard (which handles millions of keystrokes each year) only needs its batteries changed about annually.  -The dark blue ink used to label the alternate functions of the keys is very hard to read.  Being that the main market for this device is a HTPC remote, where it would be used in a darkened environment, this is just a very poor design choice.  -The right mouse button on the side of the device was broken on the unit I received.

So rather than go through the long process of registering the product for warranty and then calling (because you can only RMA by phone with Buffalo) and then waiting who knows how long to return the NAS and get a (likely refurbished) replacement, I've decided to just make use of Amazon's notoriously good RMA process getting me a free replacement in one business day.<br /><br />Really disappointed in Buffalo here. I'd expect a more common sense approach to replacing faulty drives coming from a company that specializes in data storage systems. Luckily Amazon gives you thirty days to return the old product so when the new one gets here I will the data over and at least won't lose my backed up data and at best won't have to reconfigure all of the profiles and settings.",

I also found that I can buy paperback books from Amazon.co.uk more cheaply than Kindle books, with an excellent free postage service for purchases over \u00a325.   Around the same time, I bought an Apple Ipod Touch. I quickly learnt that I could download an ereader and could buy books on the open ebook market. Now approaching the end of my first Ipod ebook, I feel dis-inclined to use the Kindle. Viewed against the Ipod, the Kindle seems large and ungainly, and the dull black and white screen is not at all appealing.  The Kindle excels where the Ipod is weak, namely, battery life. Very important. My workaround this was to buy a small neat external battery for the Ipod. Slip the battery in your pocket and you can read for many hours. Also, I like the \\\\\"open\\\\\" nature of Ipod ebook reading. You buy e-books wherever you choose.  Overall, the future for my Kindle seems in doubt.

However, it's gotten to the point that I am shopping for a new router.    I also have not had much luck connecting a hard drive to the USB port. I think the problem is that it requires an NTFS-formatted drive so it's not that convenient for Mac users. Belkin can also be faulted for lack of support. In the year that I've owned this router only one firmware update has been released, and as far as I can tell it didn't improve the device's performance or reliability in any way.    I would not recommend this product.",

Unfortunately, this will probably be my last Seagate purchase as well.    The HDD installed fine but wasn't formatted so wasn't recognized by my computer.  Inconvenient, but not a problem.  Rather than using the native Windows 7 HDD tool, I installed the packed in Discwizard software.  The software detected and formatted the HDD without a hitch, or so it seemed.  When I tried to reboot my computer later on, it wouldn't boot.  I'll skip the details, but after a lot of troubleshooting it turns out that the software messed up the master boot record of my computer.  This problem was easily fixed once identified, but this kind of problem should not exist with an HDD installation.    During my research, I discovered that the firmware my HDD shipped with (0034) has known issues (such as the loud operation and clicking some people complain about).  Upgrading the firmware turned out to be an ordeal.  Again, this kind of problem shouldn't exist with an HDD installation.  I don't know why they ship HDDs with firmware that is known to be bad.    I ultimately returned the HDD because of all these problems, although I did get it working for a while and it was fine during that period.  But I can't trust an HDD that gave me so many problems during installation with my media files.  I've installed dozens of HDDs in several computers and have never had half the problems I had with this one.    This gets two stars instead of one because I did get it working eventually, and once working it was apparently fine.  Plus it came with a SATA cable which was convenient.

Currently, I am using an EA3500 which was installed on Jan 28, 2014.  It worked well for about three months and then it started having the same problem as the prior three routers.  It starts dropping you and at first, you reboot your PC and it works again (for a while).  Start a spreadsheet of the date, time, what YOU did to correct it, whether you called Linksys, Name or ID of whom you spoke to at Linksys - add a column for what THEY had you do to resolve it.  Once you realize you are doing this on a every other or daily basis you call Linksys.  First they tell you it must be your ISP - Internet Services Provider (Cox, Verizon, AT&T, etc.), so you hang up and call your cable or other provider and if they don't tell you - ask them how many days your internet has been connected in a row.  You call Linksys back and they tell you that you need to have a computer directly connected to it with a RJ-45 or Ethernet cord. (so much for owning a laptop to use wirelessly).  You connect your PC to the router so now you should be able to get onto the internet.  They immediately tell you that your software must need an update.  They get you signed into their Smart WiFi site and they run an update for the software even if you don't need it.  You will Never see them run the  &#34;is my software up to date&#34;  button because then they might have to look further and do more than an update.  After they run the software they always changed the channels your router is using and tell you that will fix it.  And it does, for about a week. When it starts again, you think about having to bring your PC to where your router is located and sitting there while they try to correct the problem. So - you Google the problem - and you discover that Windows 8 has a new piece of software that resets your router adapter for you which corrects the problem.  You start using this nifty tool andyou think, this isn't so bad, at least I have a network connection.  After a while you realize the problem is persisting and your little fix isn't working all the time.  That is when you start going to the router and unplugging it and plugging it back in again.  Add every little thing you do to your spreadsheet.  For some reason resetting your router and at times your modem seems to work well and you think, its fixed - I solved it.  You get into a project and you are spending a lot of time on your computer and it starts again.  Now it happens when you use your computer for more than checking your email and calendar. You call Linksys and they update the software and change the channel a few more times.  Then out of frustration you go to the library to do work or anywhere they have a free network.  The seasons have changed and getting out isn't so bad.. then one day - you say I've had it and you call Linksys and tell them you can't stand the problems with this router.  The are very polite and tell you that you have only called 7 times in the entire year so it doesn't qualify as a recurrent problem and oh by the way  - your warranty expired.  But they are happy to sell you a new router, a better one - SAY _ NO Thank you and Run to the nearest real store to buy a different brand.  I wish I had... j",

I have Sony Vaios and Dell laptops, never had these problems.  I might try another Lenovo, if I can find a good priced Windows 7, else I'd get a Sony.",

I do not<br />intend to assert that after \\\\\"Detailed Study\\\\\", it's the boxes fault. That<br />said, on with the review.<br /><br />This box is AN ORNAMENT. It is entirely well suited to placing in ones<br />office with lights flashing so others think, \\\\\"WOW, is that cool or what?\\\\\".<br />It is only a NAS in that it does attach to a network. And, it does have<br />storage. I guess that's enough. But, as a flexible, functional, RAID<br />server, it is NOT!<br /><br />I bought this NAS/RAID Server to replace my Promise NS4300N RAID file<br />servers which were getting long in the tooth. Hell, I bought an extra<br />one as a warm backup/standby. Well, go figure, both my NS4300N boxes<br />died almost simultaneously. I was able to transfer all their data<br />just in time to the TS412.<br /><br />It was just in time because the 3TB file transfer on a GBit ethernet<br />to the TS412 took DAYS! Shortly after that, the last NS4300N finally<br />gave it up.<br /><br />I am now backing up the primary TS412 on my secondary TS412.<br />According to the NAS, the remaining time is...... 13 DAYS! That's<br />13 days for a 5TB transfer on GBit Ethernet. The 412s are right<br />next to each other connected by a 3 foot Cat6 cable. I utilized the<br />fact that they have 2 network interfaces. I set them up to do<br />backup so as not to busy the primary network. The bandwidth<br />usage graph for that interface shows less than 7MB/s! Remember,<br />point to point over 3 ft Cat6 with no intervening hardware....<br />7MB/s! Must be the processor? Nope... less than 50% utilization.<br />Must be the Memory? Nope... 60% physical/12% virtual utilization.<br />Must be my imagination? If you don't hear from me in the next<br />13 days, you'll know the answer.<br /><br />This box is pretty. The software/web interface is pretty as well.<br />It's stuffed with cool functions. Too bad the software is buggy<br />and quirky. You think the guys writing the software would<br />have checked out what the box does when creating multiple volumes?<br />Apparently not. Having 2 volumes with the same share folder<br />names causes the box to hide one folder. I found that out<br />when I created a second volume and all my files appeared to<br />disappear on the first volume. I couldn't get to them from<br />the web interface. But, storage was being used. I telnet<br />into the box and voila, the files are on the first volume,<br />a new share folder name is on the second and it is empty.<br />The web file manager shows.... empty. You figure it out.<br />I've had a USB external drive simply drop off line when backing<br />files from the 412 to the external drive. TS412 fault? I dunno.<br />I've tried to create a 3TB mirror from essentially blank<br />drives. I was surprised to see the format part of the program<br />go quickly and then I had to wait hours for \\\\\"Synchronizing\\\\\".<br />I'm sorry, did you just format 1 blank drive and build the<br />mirror on the other? You couldn't just mirror the blank<br />drives without synchronization and then format the mirror?<br />Please try to save me hours of my life next time. I tried<br />taking a 3TB mirror and migrating to RAID5 with another 3TB<br />drive. That took the better part of a WEEK! I was using<br />it as a USB printer server. It was working fine before<br />messing with the RAID volumes. Now, it's not working at all.<br />Is it a 412 problem? I dunno. Yet another thing to waste<br />life cycles on.<br /><br />If you research this stuff on the web, you'll find the<br />QNAP support forum. The nice people here are more<br />than happy to give you one of a few \\\\\"canned\\\\\" answers....<br />1) RTFM.<br />2) Remove the volume and recreate it.<br />3) Buy a more expensive box next time. (ie \\\\\"What do you expect?\\\\\")<br /><br />My previous life was as a software engineer. And to RTFM, Isay,<br />if you're getting the same damn questions over and over again,<br />maybe you need to wonder if your software is \\\\\"USER FRIENDLY\\\\\". Save<br />yourself and the customers some time, consider building it so<br />it's intuitive to OTHERS and not yourself. To \\\\\"Remove the volume<br />and recreate it\\\\\", I say, is that what RAID, high availability, and<br />fault tolerance is about? If my RAID is down the majority of<br />the time because I need to destroy the existing volume, the machine is<br />slow, and I'm rebuilding, who cares how robust it is when a drive fails....<br />the box is DOWN! And, if I have to spend the better part of days<br />rebuilding because of a real drive failure, how am I protected against<br />another fault? During that lengthy period another fault takes me<br />out entirely. And, to the final response \\\\\"What do you expect?\\\\\", I say,<br />I expect that an advertised feature should WORK... not work on an<br />upscale box, not be a tease. I expect that 2 boxes transferring<br />files, connected directly by a cat6 cable, should melt the cable.<br />At 6MB/s, you DONT NEED A GBit LINK! I expect that, should I have<br />a drive failure, the box can reconstruct the RAID in a \\\\\"reasonable\\\\\"<br />time so as to minimize the possibility of a second fault wiping<br />all my data. And, I expect, professional software and hardware<br />engineers know what I'm saying. I shouldn't have to buy a<br />more expensive box.<br /><br />I would not buy this box again. I will probably not buy another<br />QNAP box even though the ratings always seem good and the<br />higher end boxes seem to have quantum leap performance<br />improvements. I have a Drobo5N. I will be getting a Synology.<br />I'm repairing my Promise NS4300N servers. And, I'm thinking<br />of simply building my own RAID NAS. Fool me once.......",

We have an older Acer laptop and the engineers at Acer are much more intelligent.  The only thing Acer put on the right side was the DVD--very, very smart!!!  The AC, the heat exhaust, two USB ports, the VGA, card reader, et al. are all in the back!  These engineers got straight A's in college in the ergo courses!

Please note .... most laptops crowd the USB ports right next to each other.  Some devices are so wide that plugging in one USB makes the other USB unusable.  I have that problem with a card reader.  Look for ports on both sides or on the back and one side. The designers are too dumb to put the USB ports at least 2-3 inches from each other.  If anybody is debating going with a desktop or laptop, go with the desktop since laptops always will run hotter, thus shortening the life.  Desktops have three cooling fans (one game machine has six) and desktops have plenty of internal space for air circulation.

Updating the router to the latest firmware (B18) and adapter to the latest driver which did not significantly improve the poor performance. All other measures suggested by tech support (including turning off the 5MHz radio-antennae?!?) did not help either.     Online search revealed multiple posts on many blogs and forums complaining abt the poor performance (and heating problem) of this particular product...    Moving the wireless access point and adapter nearer to each other to abt a distance of 5-6meters between them did significantly improve the performance but it totally defeats the purpose of spending so much money to buy something which did not work as advertised....

My hope is that using a vertical mouse with a place for all five fingers will take away two stress factors with one.<br />So far, it is awkward to get used to, and fine, precise control is hard to achieve. This will likely be the case for any vertical mouse, however, and I am only considering that worth half a star. The most obvious issue for me right now, is that it feels like I have to squeeze the device to keep my hand where it needs to be. My hand is \\\\\"hanging on for life\\\\\" as it were. This causes a different strain, that I hope I find a way to eliminate. There are other reviewers that mention that a wrist support will be necessary with this type of mouse. I agree, however, I have a wrist support, and I would add that you need a wrist support at least twice as thick/tall as mine. The one I have is about .75 inches tall. In order for my arm to relax and keep my wrist in a neutral position, I think I will need one from 1.5 inches to 2.25 inches.<br /><br />I plan to add and to this review as the week goes by, and I make my decision to keep or return it.<br /><br />Day 2:<br />The strain of gripping this mouse is getting to me. As I stated before, You have to squeeze the device to keep you hand in the right spot to use the buttons and wheel. Strain is less obvious, so far, compared to a typical mouse, but not absent.<br /><br />Also, When I step away from my desk for 15 or 30 minutes, the mouse has powered-down, and will not power back on with movement. Turning the main power switch on the bottom of the device *sometimes* corrects this issue, but I have already had to remove and re-insert the USB receiver four times in 24 hours.<br />EDIT: Clicking a mouse-button wakes the device.<br /><br />Day 3:<br />The hand strain I was experiencing with \\\\\"normally\\\\\" shaped mice has just changed a bit with the new hand-position. Since you *have* to grip the device (read: squeeze), you end up with a different type of strain on top of the one you are purchasing this device to relieve.<br /><br />*Final thoughts*<br />Overall:<br />This device is imprecise and a little bit difficult to get used to. The ANKER idea of up-down is a little out of alignment with my idea of up-down. By that, I mean that when I think I am moving the device in a way that will make the mouse pointer travel only vertically, I am actually moving the pointer in a diagonal. A calibration utility where a user can choose orientation would be valuable here. I don't even feel that the orientation is quite right.<br />Precision:<br />Were have had +/-30 years to get used to the fine-motor control needed to move the mouse a single pixel at a time in any direction. This ability is rooted in the fingers (for me, the ring and thumb) and wrist and their ability to move very precisely. With a vertical orientation, ANY device with be less precise -- at least at first. I find that the same reason that these devices are supposed to be useful and ergonomic -- that they translate fine motor functions to the entire arm and specifically the shoulder muscles -- is what makes them less useful as input devices for full-time.<br /><br />Take my comments with salt. They are only my opinions.",

I purchased one of these cases tonight at the local Apple store and installed it immediately. I wanted to be able to go \\\\\"sleeveless\\\\\" in my briefcase to take advantage of the thinness of the MBA when traveling. I had researched several tech blogs on these cases as well as the feedback on Amazon as I was concerned that there may be issues with heat build up if the aluminum housing wasn't able to radiate/dissipate heat appropriately. When I saw the cases were sold in the Apple store I assumed this would not be an issue... I was wrong.  I have just removed the bottom cover after 3 hours of work for fear that too much heat was building up in my MBA. The aluminum shell on the bottom was noticeably warmer than it has ever been; it was hot to the touch. Tellingly, the aluminum cooled down almost immediately upon removing the cover... this was the nail in the coffin for my new \\\\\"protective\\\\\" cover.   During the three hours of use I had four programs open including outlook (a processor hog... its a work thing), was using the lighted keyboard and was charging the battery. Still, I continued working this way with the cover off and the difference in temperature was highly noticeable. For this reason, I will not be re-installing the bottom cover on my MBA. I do, however, intend to keep the top cover in place, as it fits nicely and will protect the more visible portion of my MBA over time. At full Apple store price (Amazon is $20 cheaper) this is an expensive consolation prize.",

I ordered the brown and the color and look is an exact match to the pictures<br /><br />The cons:  Low quality materials - the keyboard base is a dense cardboard and unless used on a solid surface, can make for a flimsy typing experience, the synthetic leather started to come apart a little at the seems after about 3 months of light use, the plastic of the keys have a cheap feel and the keys don't satisfy like other more expensive keyboards when typing.<br /><br />The unacceptable: I really wanted to like this keyboard, but cannot recommend due to the B and N keys no longer working after 6 months of fairly light use.  This would have been a great keyboard for the price, the good design and styling overcome the negatives even considering the lesser materials - but a build quality that only stands up to 6 months is unacceptable.  I can't find any product warranty information so am assuming a total loss.

Then there were the things I didn't like. The speaker for my iPad 2 was covered by the case, making the sounds very muffled, it was inconvenient to have to remove the iPad from the case each time I wanted to use the iPad as a tablet, which I do frequently in my job. The thing that forced me to return the case is that the keyboard scratched the screen protector on my iPad. I did quite of bit of research before purchasing the case, and in all the reviews I read, nothing was ever mentioned about the possibility of the keyboard scratching the screen. Maybe it was a defect on the case I received.<br />Returning the case was a complete hassle. I had to drive 21 miles to find the closest UPS/FedEx drop off site, and then had to pay shipping charges on top of it. The experience has made me weary of purchasing another keyboard for my iPad.",

This modem issue causes the modem to be utterly uselss unless you happen to have near-perfect line quality.  It will reboot several times a day, sometimes as many as 4 times per minute.  The logs will show the same 3 messages at reboot:  (1) 6-Notice N/A Cable Modem Reboot due to power reset,  (2) 3-Critical R02.0 No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out (3) 5-Warning Z00.0 MIMO Event MIMO: Stored MIMO=-1 post cfg file MIMO=-1; CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Basically, the modem is too sensitive to power fluctuations.  It sees a power fluctuation and goes into power-reset mode.<br /><br />I called Motorola customer service and they denied any issues with the modem.  They said that things like this don't indicate a bad modem, or bad design, and that everything needs handled on a case-by-case basis.  No amount of reasoning and logic would help.  They said that nearly every modem returned to them as not working works just fine in their test labs.  Unfortunately, the real world isn't a test lab and this unit contains a flawed design that makes it too sensitive for real-world applications.  When it worked, it worked fast and great - but it rebooted CONSTANTLY, making it's abilities hard to appreciate.<br /><br />Like I said, I tried 2 of these modems and each did the same thing.  The comcast-supplied Arris modem worked fine.  Finally I returned this modem and bought a Zoom 5341J (which is $20 cheaper and just as fast and awesome as the motorola should have been).  The Zoom has not rebooted in 2 months and the logs look great.<br /><br />BEWARE...this Motorola modem has known issues (just search on the internet, post after post with the same issue) and motorla refuses to accept or help.  They ignored my findings andconcerns (I am a 6-sigma black belt statistical problem solver / Shainin Red X journeyman - I get paid to problem solve extraordinarily complex problems).  They treated my findings as if they were insignificant even though I had 100% confidence in the problems being caused by the modem.  They flat out denied that this common issue, which is widely reported all over the internet, is a design problem or due to faulty hardware.  That's not customer service.<br /><br />Get the Zoom 5341J and you'll not have any problems at all.  It's as blazingly fast as the motorola and far superior in technical design.",

I paid premium prices for my build thinking I was getting the Lifetime warranty on my $400+ motherboard (main reason for purchasing that motherboard), but when it went out 3 years later I found out it was only covered for a year because it had an R at the end of the serial number, meaning it was a refurbished board and the warranty had expired two years prior. I would expect that when I spend over $3K on a gaming system it should be built with new items. Ask questions about your build and the warranties on individual parts and try not to get stuck with used parts. Motherboard was only used part on my build. Good luck.",

That plus a lot of the android apps my roommate uses on his android phone would not run on the tablet.  I finally gave up, returned this tablet and bought an iPad 1 for $400 and have been MUCH happier.  The main problem is that I'm an iPhone user and am apparently very picky about app quality and quantity.  It seemed like most of the free apps in the android tablet app store were either junk (lets just call the user interface \\\\\"quirky\\\\\") and 50% of the apps were just porn apps (no wonder android malware is up 600% from 6 months ago).  Played around with a Samsung galaxy tablet on black Friday and it looked like it fixed many of my concerns, though at a higher price point.  The Samsung seemed to perform slightly better, and its email app seemed to be generic and allowed all email accounts not just Google accounts.

Unfortunately the Male end does not have the same problem, and pops out of the USB port without too much effort or resistance.  Then, to top it off, it's not even USB 3.0!  Sure it's a pretty blue color, but when plugging in a USB 3.0 stick (Kensington), into this adapter, which is plugged into a 3.0 port, Windows tells me that I would get better performance if I plug the stick into a 3.0 port - which I have as soon as I remove this crappy adapter.  USB 3.0 Stick performance on 2.0 port = 23.9Mb/s, on a 3.0 port = 33.6Mb/s, using this adapter (on the 3.0 port, of course) = 24.2Mb/s.

(My best guess is that the spindle of the drive is off-balance.  Even turning the four restraining tabs over the CD does not help, as the tabs do not extend out far enough to cover the edges of a standard CD.  That's a frustrating Ricoh design flaw!)<br />Every time the awful noise happens and the shredding of the CD in the Ricoh drive begins, I take the CD out and blow the plastic dust off of it, then put it in the *5 year old* Sony CDRW drive on my primary Dell PC (that has flawlessly played at least 1,000 CDs and burned hundreds of CD-Rs over 5 years).  It always plays just fine in that Sony drive.<br />I'm now shopping for a non-Ricoh drive to replace this one.

With Fire replacement #9, the battery itself died after only days of use and will not charge. I'm done. No more replacements of this junk.

The second thing is when i purchased these pens the description said there was a pink green and black pen, well what i received was a red green and black one. How disappointing because the only reason i purchased these pens were for the pink one for my mother and the green one for myself. These pens were described as brand new which they clearly have places of wear on the such as the black pen had on the black part and shiny parts as well. Very disappointed and will not buy from this seller again. Thank you",

Not so.<br /><br />The product came with two cloths but no instructions which cloth to use first, and which cloth should be used last and would remove dust.  So, even though I cleaned the screen with the included cloths for about 15 minutes then looked at the screen many directions under my craft lamp, I ended up with a speck of lint under the first screen protector.  I pulled it back and tried to get the lint off off with one of the enclosed cloths.  What a mistake.  Then I had lint all over the screen protector leaving the first screen protector ruined.<br /><br />Then I used the 2nd protector and it went on crooked.  I pulled it back to try to straighten it, and after doing that twice, I got it on straight but there is lint under the outside edges and part of the camera is covered.  There are also several tiny bubbles that I can't remove and trying to remove them just scratches the screen protector.  But there are probably microscopic pieces of dust under the screen protector causing the bubbles...<br /><br />And it fingerprints worse than the bare Nexus screen!!!<br /><br />I gave it two stars because I've never installed something like this before so i was being generous with my rating.  If I had done this before and had this much trouble I would have given it 1 star.<br /><br />The only good thing about this product was I bought it from Amazon at the same time i bought my Nexus case and it put me over the $25 for free shipping and cost less than the shipping on the Nexus case would have been if I hadn't bought the screen protectors.  So I guess I'm not really out any cash, just time and aggravation.",

So the reporting function IS NOT local, but depends on using a Cisco web URL to work. It reports the PC's sites visited (but not times), overall online usage time and a funky over simplified graph. The reporting would be much better without having to wait for a report, and depending on a website \\\\\"service\\\\\".    Software Installation:  In a peer-to-peer network, not using a server, you have to install and setup the software on each computer - a big waste of time. This includes setting up a username and password for each PC.    Network File sharing:  What a joke - you can set this up in windows, why on earth would you want to have more software using resources ?    Network Printer Sharing:  See Network File sharing ,(above), same thing - you can do it easily with windows.    Oh - the only thing that was nice was the network diagram. It showed devices on the network with their names, for instance iPhone, PDA, Desktop, laptop, etc. and indicated if they were on line or not.     A lot of what this software gives you can be accomplished with windows GUI, Graphical User Interface, or DOS command line commands.    Now if you have a Linksys (Cisco) router after the week trial you get limited functionality of the program - you can't get reporting anymore for instance.    In my humble opinion I think if you buy a Linksys router they should give you this software instead of having to pay $50.00 for it (on their site Sept 2009).  I have subsequently gone around and un-installed this software on all my computers. It is not worth anything - well maybe $5. for the network diagram, that was nice.    One more thing - you cannot do file/printer sharing with a Palm device. (I have a Palm TX, but it did show up on the cute network diagram !!!    Please don't waste your money or time. Thanks.",

This was strangely ironic timing since less than 48 hours later the adapter would charge only intermittently, and as other reviewers have mentioned, this was due to a faulty power cord. It got to such a point that the unit failed completely.<br />The email exchange with customer services was both prompt and polite and they sent a replacement unit, at no charge to me, which arrived only days later. Upon unpacking and plugging in the new adapter I was dismayed to find that it was DOA. No light and no amount of cable wiggling would change that.<br />In a last ditch effort I tried the new cord with the old adapter and the old cord with the new adapter and found that the first combination actually worked (for now).<br />I will continue to monitor the performance of the adapter over the coming months to see if it will last longer than the previous one.<br /><br />I understand that products sometimes fail, and the initial email from customer service admitted that they expect 1 in 1000 units to fail, but to have 1 die after 3 weeks and the replacement not even work on arrival reflects poorly on the manufacturing and/or quality control department.<br /><br />As far as the adapter's performance while working - I was very pleased. It does the job it is built for and in comparison, the cable is just marginally shorter than the original HP one. Also, this adapter does not get as hot as the HP one used to. For the money, so long as you aren't the unfortunate 1 in 1000 (twice) this would be a reasonable replacement should your original HP give up on you.<br /><br />Personally, even though the customer service was impeccable, I doubt I will make a future purchase from this company, nor will I recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />In summary<br />Adapter performance (for 3 weeks) 5 stars<br />Manufacturing/Quality Control 1 star<br />Customer Service 5 stars<br /><br />Overall 2 stars, considering I actually \\\\\"Frankensteined\\\\\" a (currently) working adapter from 2 dead ones.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Since writing this review, the adapter has failed once again. Totally frustrated with this company and unwilling to waste anymore time with them, I decided to open the unit in order to figure out the issue. Having a degree in Electronic Engineering, I figured that I could spot a loose wire or something in the transformer pack.<br /><br />I was horrified to see that the inside of the casing was scorched and discolored. The reason for this was a dry joint on the plug where the power cable plugs into the transformer pack. I tested the device with the case open and found that the dry joint was causing sparks which discolored the interior.<br /><br />I also opened the other power supply and found the exact same condition, a dry joint causing sparks as the electricity arcs across the gap.<br /><br />In my experience, these adaptors are potential fire hazards.

I have SpeedFan on my laptop (tells you the temperature inside your laptop), and without letting my laptop get so hot that it automatically shuts off...it's the only way I could think to see if this product actually worked. The temperature on SpeedFan actually goes up approximately 3-5 Celsius every time I turn this pad on. If I arrange the pad so that none of its fans are directly under my laptop's fan, then the temperature remains roughly the same as if the pad is off (i.e. less than when the pad is on). The only real utility I get from this pad is, since I use my laptop on cushion-y surfaces all the time like the bed and blankets, having a hard pad (turned off) underneath my laptop keeps the air flow from getting smothered by those soft cushions--those cushions raise the temperature inside my laptop and eventually result in my laptop shutting off. But as far as my laptop going up to 60 or even 70 Celsius while just trying to watch videos online sometimes...this does not totally help with that, no matter what I try. I would have liked to be able to watch videos with my laptop's power settings on \\\\\"high performance,\\\\\" (not to mention keep my AC adapters from frying to death--I've had two die with this laptop since getting it a year and a half ago) but the temperature still gets way too hot to be able to do that. The only way it won't go into the 60s or 70s is if I keep it on \\\\\"power saver,\\\\\" which oftentimes will make the videos run slower/choppily.     Guess I will be looking for a better cooling pad.",

I have a small home network (two computers, a desktop and a laptop), and this seemed a better solution for file-sharing than the USB thumb drive I had been using.        Alas, I don't think this product is quite ready for prime time.  I installed it as directed in the Quick Start guide...and nothing happened.  The drive was not detected.  It just gave me a \\\\\"failed mount\\\\\" error message.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  I tried installing it on my other computer.  I went to Western Digital's web site, searched their knowledge base, and tried every solution suggested.  No dice.      So I e-mailed tech support.  They said they'd get back to me in one business day.  They didn't.  So I called them.      They do have a toll-free tech support number.  And you get 30 days of free tech support, starting from the first time you call them.  After that, it's fifteen bucks a call.      Navigating the Western Digital phone menu is a bit of challenge.  Which number you should press for help with this product isn't obvious, and if you don't press a number, they hang up on you.  I was expecting to be routed to a human operator if I didn't pick a number, but no.  They hang up on you, and you have to listen to the spiel and go through everything all over again.  So here's a tip: choose \\\\\"firewire or USB external drive.\\\\\"  Even though this isn't a firewire or USB drive.    Once I got that far, they put me on hold.  Which I was expecting, but it was particularly obnoxious, because they play classical music - at truly ear-splitting levels.  It was so loud I had to hold the phone several inches from my ear or it was downright painful.  I was really starting to think they were trying to get you to hang up and go away.    The call center, judging from the accents, is somewhere in India.  Everyone was very friendly and polite, but it was often hard to understand what they were saying (especially if you're half-deaf from listening to that darned music).They made me spell out my name, address, etc., in military speak (alpha-bravo-charlie-delta).      They talked me through pinging the new drive and mapping it.  That seemed to fix the problem.  The drive was detected, both via Windows and via Mionet.  I hung up.  And the computer promptly gave me the \\\\\"failed mount\\\\\" error message again.  Arrghhh.      So I called back the next day.  Again the ear-splitting music, and a different (but equally polite) guy with a thick Indian accent.  I had my case number, but they had no record of it.  Yay.  I got to spell out my name and address again.  After all that, he was not able to resolve my problem, and put me on hold again.  After several long minutes with the music from hell, he told me that his supervisor would be calling me back in 15 or 20 minutes.      He lied.  They never called me back.  However, the problem fixed itself when I created a new Mionet account.  The new Mionet account didn't work, but when I went back to the old one, it started working.  I have no idea how long this fix will last, but at the moment, it's working as it should.    Mionet is now owned by Western Digital.  It's kind of like GoToMyPC.  The version you get with this drive is a limited edition.  It gives you 30 days of regular Mionet access, then you have to pay or many features go away.  They don't really make this clear in the product description.      You don't need to use Mionet, though (except for remote access).  If you just want to use this drive on your home network, you can do that with Windows' built-in networking capability.      And here's a tip for ZoneAlarm users: turn it off while you install this drive.  Letting Mionet through isn't enough.  I had to turn it off to map the drive, then I had to add the IP address of the drive to ZoneAlarm's \\\\\"trusted zones\\\\\" list manually.  For some reason, it didn't add itself, or ask me if I wanted to allow it.      PROS:  Looks very nice.  Small footprint.  Cool idea.    CONS:  Installation was aheadache.  (Search on \\\\\"failed mount\\\\\" and \\\\\"mionet,\\\\\" and you'll see it's a common problem.)  It's slower than a USB or Firewire drive, at least on the average home network.  Tech support could be better.  Documentation (a PDF on the installation disk) is pretty poor.          I've been an Amazon customer for years, and have bought a ton of stuff from them.  This was the first item I seriously considered returning.  Now that it's working, I will probably keep it.  However, if I could do it all over again, I might buy the [[ASIN:B000UF3DNG 2.0TB My Book Premium USB/fw]] instead, and just use a USB switch or something to share it between my desktop and laptop.    UPDATE: Five months later, I am happier with this than I was originally.  I would probably give it one more star.    The first month or two, it was very buggy.  It kept dropping off my network, and I would have to try various things to get it back.  (Turning it off and on, rebooting my computer, logging in and out of Mionet, pinging the drive, etc.)  I was about ready to name the drive \\\\\"Brigadoon,\\\\\" because you never knew when you see it.  Especially annoying is when it would go offline while you were trying to copy files over to it.  (The slow connection means it takes a long time to transfer data.)    However, lately it's been pretty reliable, and I'm happy with it.  I must admit, it's convenient to have one drive that all the computers in the house can share.      I'm not sure why it's working so well now, when it didn't before. I suspect it's Mionet.  If the Mionet site is down, you can't access your drive.  Well, you can if you're computer literate enough, but really, this drive isn't being marketed to that kind of person. Mionet seems to have improved their reliability lately, and so this drive is performing a lot better.    IMO, Mionet remains the biggest drawback to this product.  I don't think they made it clear enough that it's a subscription service (though you can use a crippled version for free), andthat if Mionet is down, you can't access the drive (unless you're a pretty advanced computer user).    Update, 9/29/2009: I just got notification that Mionet will be down for THREE DAYS while they upgrade to Mionet 4.0.  That it just unacceptable.  Three days is a lifetime when you're talking about accessing your computer files.  What are they thinking??!!!",

I followed the instructions, which is to load the software first, to install the card. When the installation prompted for card insertion, I followed and it froze the laptop. If I manually unplug the card, the computer would unfreeze (and even perform keystrokes I have had entered during the freeze). I thought the card was not compatible with my computer's particular setup. But when I tried it with a second laptop (completely different brand/setup) it freezes in the same way.<br /><br />So instead, I tried avoiding the software, and just use Windows to install the driver and manage the wireless. I got that to work maybe 5% of the time, the rest would result in the same freeze until I remove the card. After searching online, I found that I am not the only case experiencing this or similar problem with the product.<br /><br />I looked on NETGEAR's website and found that there are no firmware updates available since the initial release in 2005. Apparently, the card has been phased out in favor of the newer RangeMax NeXT series (including WN511B & WN511T).<br /><br />I would avoid this card and look at the newer, and probably better supported, RangeMax NeXT cards. If you could wait (and has it been a long wait) I'd suggest waiting till they ratify the 802.11n spec so that companies can start making inter-compatible adapters/accesspoints.",

I do a lot of spreadsheet work for my business and wanted a keypad that would fit in and complement my MBA system. Well, after over six months of use, I've decided to ditch this and went to the local Apple Store to pick up Apple's extended keyboard with the USB cable. Wireless is nice but the problems that this unit was causing made me decide that it's just not worth the annoyances.<br /><br />First off, as other reviewers have mentioned, this LMP keypad looks and feels cheap. But I was willing to accept that since all I really needed this for was crunching numbers. What I couldn't deal with anymore was how fast it consumed the rechargeable batteries and how it wouldn't sync up every time I replaced the batteries. It also caused some sort of a conflict with Apple's wireless keyboard every time I rebooted the computer. The Apple keyboard wouldn't work until I signed on using the built-in keyboard on the MBA. When I would turn off this keypad, then this problem would go away.<br /><br />Replacing the batteries on this unit and getting it working again with the MBA became an exercise in frustration. When you go through something like that, all the other little details that you find lacking on the product start becoming more and more bothersome. The poorly designed battery compartment cover makes it more comparable to a cheap toy you'd buy for little kids at Toys R' Us. I started feeling bad about placing such a device in between Apple's keyboard and trackpad. When you start typing on it, you immediately notice it just doesn't feel as good as Apple's keyboard. Still, I was willing to live with it and I did for many months.<br /><br />Again, the main problem was having to start over and set up this device like it was a brand new one every time I changed the batteries. Another thing that's not quite right about this keypad is that the layoutisn't like a normal extended keyboard. Combine these annoyances and you have a unit that just isn't worth your time and money. I just replaced the Apple wireless keyboard (although there was absolutely nothing wrong with that fine piece of gear) and this keypad with the Apple extended keyboard and I wonder why I put up with it for as long as I did. This is simply not a good product. It worked well enough but just doesn't deserve to be hooked up with Apple devices.",

I think its reasonable to expect to be able to control/configure a device from the main unit. <br /> <br />MUSICMATCH Jukebox: <br />What was Cisco/Linksys thinking?  This device requires MUSICMATCH Jukebox running on your media server in order to access your songs.  Now, I realize that this area is still not standardized in the industry...each manufacturer seems to have their own server-side software package that is responsible for streaming your music.  However, most manufacturers are using either Windows Media Player, or their own proprietary software.  Linksys chose to use a shareware program that constantly bombardes you with advertisements, and ofers to \\\\\"upgrade\\\\\" to their not-free \\\\\"professional\\\\\" version.   <br /> <br />I will return this today and continue to search/wait for a more robust stand-alone media streaming device. <br />",

Up until that point it had been fine and I had been happy with how it was working for the money I had spent on it.  It had a technical issue where the battery would not charge and the computer could not get power from the adapter.  I could not turn it on at all.  Since it was covered by the warranty, I decided to contact Gateway.    First of all, you can only contact customer service online.  You can't call, only chat.  This presents an issue if your computer is not working and you don't have another backup computer handy.  That said, if you buy a Gateway computer, it's probably wise to have a backup ready.    I understand that broken English is par for the course when it comes to tech support, so that didn't bother me much.  However, the people I was forced to chat with were so slow to respond that gateway's own chat client kept shutting down due to inactivity!  I had to log on three times and each time explain everything the person before had told me.  This took a total of 5.5 hours just to get the address to send the computer to for service.    The first tech support person told me that I should go out and buy another adapter to see if the one I had was the issue.  He said that if it was, they would send me another one.  Since i didn't have a 19Volt adapter with the specific gateway end on it I went out and got one, only to find that it wasn't the problem.  So now, I own two adapters for my broken computer.  The second person I \\\\\"spoke\\\\\" with again timed out while asking me questions about what the first person had asked me to do.  The third person told me that the warranty would NOT cover the situation and that I should send them $199.00.  I told the person that the previous 2 tech support people had both said that it was covered and after a 10 minute pause (during which I had to keep tying to stop the chat client from timing out) he informed me that he was wrong and that I did not in facthave to send money.    However, I did have to pay to send my computer to Texas.  It has to be wrapped very specifically (3-5\\\\\" of protective wrap, no packing peanuts, etc etc), and they tell you that it should be insured and not sent by the USPS. It cost me $61.00 to send it including the money for the special protective box.  Honestly a total nightmare.    When a Dell I purchased had a broken speaker I called tech support and the next day a special packing container arrived from UPS.  I just put the laptop inside it and handed it back to the courier.  They fixed it and got it back to me with no money spent on my part and almost not fuss at all.    I suppose the point I'm trying to make with all this is that if you buy one of these laptops you had better hope (against the odds) that it doesn't break.

It does not fit well on the top and is bowed out and does not seen to stay attached very well.<br /><br />3. The fold out feet on the bottom section are super flimsy and make the laptop wiggle when you type with them extended. It wouldn't take much to break them off.<br /><br />4. Overall the shell seems to be thin and somewhat brittle plastic. I don't know how much protection it really offers other than from scratches by setting it down on something.<br /><br />If you just want something cheap and don't really go any where, this is probably fine. It does not really compare to the quality of the other shells, like the Speck ones. They are worth the extra $20 or $30 in my opinion for a better fit and better build.",

I bought it because it could be propped up if you were unable to hold the Amazon Paperwhite, as crazy as that sounds to me now, that was my line of thinking at the time, but in reading a book which is what you do with a Paperwhite, you still have to press to turn pages. I am the Queen of Cases. I have several for each of my electronics iPad, iPhone, Paperwhite, Kindle Fire HD 7 inch and 8.9 inch.<br /><br />I like cases like this that actually snap into the back cover, which is like a tray. From experience, the cases where you slide them in from the top, have been problems with sliding our of case if you pick it up wrong. I have been using the Nouske Origami Case for the Kindle Paperwhite for a couple of weeks now and I feel that it is one of the least protective cases I have ever purchased and with the amount of cases I own that is saying a lot. The back of the case is fine, it has the tray like design that the Paperwhite snaps in to. It is the front of the case that I have a problem with and let's face it.....the damage to a screen can pretty much guarantee that you will have an expensive repair or have to get a new Paperwhite. Where you see the lines are very thin rubber or maybe silicone and the puzzle piece larger parts are like similar material over cardboard (at least it feels like cardboard). The binding that attaches the back tray to the front cover is very thin and very pliable and I think this is the biggest problem. If you just close the cover it could close a bit off position where the one end is slightly off the front. I think this is caused by the very thin binding material, which also due to the thinness does not provide protection to the binding side because the hard plastic tray is cut out almost the entire length of the binding side except at the two corners. Finally like most of the covers with the snap in tray bottom, there is a magnet in the top edge. On most of my other cases, this magnet is strong and almost draws the top over to the correct position to put the cover in perfect alignment. As I am writing this I am double checking and there is probably some sort of magnet but I cannot feel it at all. Most times between the weak magnet and the very flimsy binding the cover closes out of alignment. If you want to protect the length of your battery you want you Paperwhite to go to sleep, but if the top of the cover has the alignment off it does not always do that. I think this is one of the few covers I have bought that really leaves the screen open to accidental breakage. I am taking the cover off and I don't think I have the covering that came with it so I am out the purchase price.<br /><br />I have tried to give a complete and not exaggerated review of this cover. If you are like me and you put your Paperwhite into your bag when you go somewhere like the doctor's office, you might want to look a one of the other covers with a full stable front cover and a full snap in back tray with four FULL sides instead of three.almost draws the top over to the correct position to put the cover in perfect alignment.

The customer service tried to blame it on me not using the designated charger, which was not the case. Further, there is no support for Audible in India which makes it difficult to communicate with them. I have a tablet that refuses to stay awake and therefore denies me a pleasure reading let alone a good multimedia experience. The Customer service is slack and there is no sense of follow up. This even as I continue to pay installments for the device. This was one sorry investment for me. And I recommend that those in India refrain from investing in this tablet.",

The elastic corner straps are very tight and hard to move to a good spot to get the thing in the case.  -Button access is bad. The side buttons are recessed into the case and hard to press. I have to jam my fingertip in the case to get the buttons to work. In addition to the recessed access issue, the power button on top suffers from being half covered by the plastic holding the case in. It's a pain to access the button.    Overall:  Avoid this case. It feels like they only adjusted the size of the straps and the plastic to fit the iPad in. I highly doubt any usability testing was done due to the button access issues.",

Clicking on Refresh almost always immediately got me to the site, but it was annoying to have to do this. This behavior was not seen on the old router.<br /><br />Problem 2: The Remote Assistance feature of Windows Live messenger was unusable. Attempting to establish a Remote Assistance session would cause the users to be logged off Live Messenger for about 30 seconds. This was true not only trying to use this over the internet but also locally on our LAN.

Tweeters worked, but subwoofer didn't.  I just had to cut power wire off of sub, and volume controls, and send it back.  4 weeks later, another new system came.  It was great up until December, when the left speaker output jacks went out.  I plugged both into right, soon after that failed also.  So eventually, I ended up plugging tweeters into another stereo, and running a different line to sub, just so I could have some bass.  3/23, subwoofer stopped working.  I'm going to take it apart, and try and salvage the subwoofer itself, but it is not easy to repair these things if they break, they make sure of that.  Anyway, If you want a system thats going to last longer, I reccomend you go custom.  Buy a reciever with some sattelite tweeter speakers, and run another line to a amplifier powering a sub, thats how I'm doing it now.  BECAREFUL, only 90 day warranty.",

My intent was to put the computer in the sleeve, and the sleeve into the bag. I thought that I had researched this well, but there's nothing like having the actual items in hand to see what's going on.    Once I put the computer in the sleeve (it fit fine), and the sleeve into the bag, I realized it just wasn't going to work. Part of the problem was the 6 cell battery, which caused the computer/sleeve to stick up beyond the plane of where the top flap would close properly. I was able to pull the top flap over and it reached to the velcro to attach - not all, but some.     Then I starting putting in the rest of the stuff. I stuck the mouse into the little phone bag attached to the sleeve, and put the power brick & cord into the front compartment, along with my 2 electrical adapters. I could immediately see that it just wasn't a good fit, and that it wasn't going to work.    I did experiment to see how the computer fit into the bag without the sleeve - it did fit, but just barely at the top. Again, once you start loading up the bag with the power brick & cord, etc., there just isn't any room at all. I didn't even see how you could fit a magazine or a newspaper in once it was loaded up.    Lastly, in looking over the bag, I didn't think that it was really well made. I did like the look of the bag, though.     If you have a netbook smaller than my S12 (mine measures 11.5\\\\\" x 9.1\\\\\" x 1.1\\\\\"), it will probably fit OK. Just don't expect to be taking a lot of other stuff along with it.    I write this waiting for the replacement bag - a Mobile Edge MEUEMB, also ordered from Amazon (great price) - to arrive this week. Hopefully, it will work out better than the STM bag, especially since it doesn't need the sleeve.",

Some Logitech exec must have had stock in eBay, because for six years that was the only place you could go to get a mouse of the Revolution's quality. Since my last Revolution died, I'd been considering buying a &#34;new&#34; one on eBay, so just imagine how thrilled I was to discover the Master. The price point was absurdly high, of course, but then even a six year old used Revolution isn't much lower. For the right kind of user - I do CAD drafting, for example - it's worth it.  From a hardware standpoint, the MX Master is ALMOST there. It's beautifully designed, fits nicely in the hand, and has many of the features that made the Revolution so perfect, like the software-controlled ratchet/freewheel scroll and the thumb controls. It does lack the side-tilting center scroll wheel, which was wonderful for things like tab-switching in a browser, but the thumb scroll wheel seems better than the Revolution's. And there are some ways in which it's clearly an improvement over the Revolution, like the seamless Bluetooth pairing, a better laser, and improved battery life. (That short list of improvements may seem like faint praise, given that the Revolution came out almost a decade ago, but that's because the Revolution was amazing, not because this isn't.) It also has a gesture button under the thumb, which is a little awkward to use - you have to press the button downward while moving the mouse up, down, left, or right, but pushing the button down with the thumb tends to brake the mouse's movement - but which I suspect I might come to like with time. (EDIT: I have indeed come to like this, and it didn't take very much time at all.)  But then everything went wrong on the software side. While the Revolution used SetPoint, Logitech's longtime beast of a software controller, the Master uses a new program, Logitech Options, and is apparently incompatible with SetPoint. That would be a good thing if Options could do what SetPoint did, but it... doesn't. There is no way in Options to set application-specific button assignments. When you click the &#34;More&#34; button on the Options homescreen, expecting to see the application-specific settings, you get... your mouse's firmware version number.  Let me be clear: it is completely impossible to assign a given button to do one thing in one program and another thing in a different one. If you want the thumb scroll wheel to change tabs in Firefox, but you want it to scroll horizontally in AutoCAD... that's too bad. It can't do that. You just spent a hundred dollars for a mouse that can't do that - not because of any limitation of the mouse, but because they removed that capability from the hardware. The word &#34;nerfing&#34; comes to mind. Not to get too Freudian, but the word &#34;castrating&#34; comes to mind too. This mouse has a custom &#34;gesture&#34; button... but you can't assign different gestures in different programs. Just... what?  Why on Earth did they do that? According to a Logitech rep on their forums, &#34;The new software interface emphasizes more on the simplicity of navigation and accessibility to all types of users.&#34; This is incomprehensible even as an excuse; why on earth is &#34;simplicity&#34; the primary design criterion on the software for a mouse with five buttons and two scroll wheels? Besides, as I said, there is already a &#34;more&#34; button that opens a tabbed dialog with exactly two options (notifications on low battery and automatic updates for Logitech Options). An additional tab in that dialog would hardly count as bloat.  Logitech is, apparently, considering (or at least considering considering) adding application-specific settings at some ill-defined point in the future. Once they do that, then I might be more willing to recommend this. But without application-specific settings, how can I possibly recommend this mouse to a power user? And with a three-digit price point, how can I possibly recommend this mouse to anyone else?",

(Something I later learned was a new, accelerated process with logitech mice)<br /><br />Within a couple weeks of using this mouse, the left click died, it either doesnt click, clicks partially and releases mid hold, or hilariously, douoble clicks when you click once. IT has done some amazing things due to this, from dropping items in the wrong places  on a desktop to making my machine guns in FPS simply stop shooting because full auto doesnt work if your mouse click stops sending a signal even though your finger is pressed down on it. Computer programming with this thing attached to your pc is a pretty big nightmare because you cant reliably select even simple things like blocks of text, half the time when you click to close a tabbed window you will close two etc. The list goes on, its pretty annoying and the only reason I still have it around is because I am debating tearing it open to see if I can fix it.<br /><br />Despite the pros of this mouse, I would say get a Razer  brand one instead. The same friend who bought me this thing had his brand new logitech mmo mouse (an $80 dollar logitech mouse at time of purchase) die after less than a month of use. All other logitech mice I have seen recently have all been developing this issue as well.<br /><br />Logitech's response is that your usb ports must be bad etc.<br /><br />Logitech has lost a loyal customer of many years with their cheap quality sub-par hardware. I started buying logitech with my first joystick years ago and a keyboard from them is probably the last purchase I will ever make from them (I bought it before the mouse started dying or ID have just bought a different brand of keyboard as well) The price is all the name now, but you are getting something cheap with the logitech brand name stamped on it. Avoid Logitech Lemon mice. The keyboard seems good though",

The Seagate drivers made the issue worse for me.  Based on some reading I deleted the drivers and reformatted to Mac and it worked slightly better.  By doing this at least now I can copy large files without hanging up on me (the only resolution is a hard restart of the Mac).  But now when the Mac goes to sleep it periodically will either a0 put the drive to sleep from which it will not wake up, or b) cause the drive to spin at a high speed without sleeping!  I have two of these drives (3tb and 4tb) and it happens to both.<br /><br />Seagate's reply has been to update the drivers with theirs (again, makes matters worse), or to let you know that they have a Mac compatible version of the drive that doesn't need the drivers - thanks for letting me know this after my return period on these crap drives has expired!  Your marketing of PC/Mac compatible lead me to believe this WAS MAC COMPATABLE!",

            "input": "[2/23/14 - edited to downgrade rating to one star]<br /><br />I ordered this in October and the keyboard pretty much immediately went haywire.  See review below for details.  I reluctantly ordered a replacement which required me to transfer ALL of my data and software from the lemon, and then figure out how to wipe the hard drive so my personal information wouldn't be in some strangers hands.  That took days.  But I did it, in mid-January.  Started using this computer, the replacement.  Less than a month later, this keyboard is failing as well.  The A key simply will not type normally.  I type a word, the A doesn't appear, so I have to backspace and POUND on the keyboard to get it to type the A.  Other keys are also going out intermittently, particularly the spacebar and shift key.  I will have to hook up an external keyboard in order to use this piece of crap.  The return window has closed.  I am furious.  If it had only happened once, I would figure the original computer was a lemon.  But it happened twice.  Either I'm incredibly unlucky or Toshiba makes crap laptops.  I'm inclined to think the latter.<br /><br />[10/29/13 edited to add the following information:]<br /><br />There are times when I'm on-line browsing and want to type some text (say, a comment in a user forum) and the keyboard will go haywire.<br /><br />One example: I press a single key (alphanumeric character) and the browser will fly to another browser tab, or open the java console.  Then when I navigate back to the original tab and try to continue typing, either the keyboard will hijack the same keystroke and throw me off again, or I simply will not be able to continue typing.  I will be able to type in OTHER tabs but not that one. After about three tries, and refreshing the tab, I will be able to continue typing. I have had many computers (laptops, desktops, etc) and have never had this issue with any of them.<br /><br />Another problem is that the start menu sometimes pops up when I have not pressed the Windows key.  And I have also had issues with the computer backing up the browser tab to the page whence I came - something that should only happen with the backspace key, and even then not when I'm typing text.<br /><br />I'm sure there's a fix for it.  But frankly I wanted to take the @)#(*$)@ thing out of the box and USE it, not have to research why this is happening.<br /><br />[original review:]<br /><br />I've been setting up software for hours, trying to configure the computer so I can actually - you know - USE IT - and already the keyboard is driving me nuts.  Several of the keys, especially on the bottom row, are skipping.  With normal typing if I press the letter C, most of the time the C doesn't show up on the screen.  This REALLY affects my ability to get things done and slows down my typing.  I can only imagine this will get worse over time, not better.  Or I will have calluses on my fingers from slamming them down on the keyboard to get it to recognize a key press.<br /><br />The Ctrl+F5 hard refresh does not work as I'm used to (seems to toggle the mousepad on and off) ... it's the little things that drive you crazy isn't it (that came out \\\\\"razy\\\\\" the first time, had to go back and type it over).<br /><br />Other things that are just STUPID about the design.  Two of the three USB ports are on the right side of the computer, toward the front.  I plugged in a wireless mouse and an external hard drive and the cords and the mouse stick are jutting out onto the area of the desk where I want to use the mouse.<br /><br />Why are the USB ports at the front? Why are they on the right?  Did they test this configuration with the average right-handed person before signing off on it?<br /><br />I would return this except I need a working computer and I don't want to have to set up the software all over again.  Plus I set up Thunderbird to download my emails from the server to my hard disk.  I suppose I could figure out a way to port them over to a new computer but I just hate wasting all those hours I have spent setting up this computer.<br /><br />Well, I guess you get what you pay for huh?<br /><br />FYI I paid $449.99 + 8.75% tax plus a $4 hazardous waste fee.",

It was great, but it used a proprietary rechargeable battery that quit taking a charge and have not been able to find a replacement. (Message to self, \\\\\"NEVER buy a rechargeable mouse again.\\\\\" A stupid design decision IMO.) The others were the Media Center Remote, which is great and I still use daily, and a Gyrotransport which had potential except for an idiotic battery compartment design. That brings me to this one, which I was hoping would be a suitable replacement for the Ultra GT, but no way.    Pros:  Standard disposable batteries.  Nice carrying pouch.  Convenient storage slot in the mouse for the receiver when not in use.  Gyration's customer service.    Fatal flaws:  Ergonomics - Unlike all the other Gyration products I've used, this one is very awkward to use.  Battery Cover - Like the Gyrotransport, this one also has an idiotic battery compartment design. The battery compartment cover broke while putting in my first set of batteries.    Gyration's customer support has been perfect, if only their design team was as good.  They have replaced the broken battery compartment doors for both the Gyrotransport and this mouse with no hassle. Unfortunately, I will probably need a large supply of these battery compartment covers, since they are at risk every time I have to replace batteries. It's a fight getting them open and they are very very fragile.",

            "input": "I will review this laptop from the perspective of the owner who is used to the more expensive notebooks in the past. I have purchased ASUS on the request of the friend as for the price it had some very good specs and seemed to be a real bargain. Large screen, Intel i3 Dual core CPU and 4GB of DDR3 RAM plus plethora of connectivity options.  Laptop came very quickly thanks to the Prime and, besides from Amazon providing virtually zero padding to the package, everything else was in order. After testing it for the past couple of days here are some notes:  - First thing that jumps at you once you start it up is that keyboard is as bad as everyone else is reporting here. With every key stroke, the whole keyboard (not just the key you press) presses down and then springs back up. It has a good 1/4'' vertical movement. Once working on it for half an hour, I was able to readjust my strokes but the feeling of the cheapness does not go away and I have to seriously question long term durability of this keyboard. I have seen some cheap keyboards in the past but ASUS was able to create a whole new category of low and take a leading position. Besides, the keyboard does not have a back light and I find it mystifying of why such a low cost but highly usable feature is continuously being left out on the cheap models.  - Screen is big and this is seriously the only only complement I can give. The brightness, contrast and view angles are bad and don't compare to the screens you would find in other brands. This screen is practically unusable in bright light conditions (outdoors) and whatever contrast it has when you look straight at it is quickly lost once you shift around.  - Battery life is mediocre. Laptop comes with 4 power modes that can be further customized: from power mode to the battery save mode. In power mode with full screen brightness and streaming video from Wi-Fi connection, it lasts less then 2 hours. This is not what I would call ideal. In light browsing with screen half-dimmed I was able to work for 3.5 hours which is still inadequate. The battery is quit simply weak, so don't plan on going too far away from the power source.      The rest of the news are not as bad. Laptop seems very responsive and can handle quite a few tasks, including playing every video I could throw at it while simultaneously processing large archive of data and downloading latest patches from the Internet. Intel Core i3 is a definite upgrade over the budget chips and if your budget allows it, I would even spring for i5 CPU as it handles power more efficiently and should give a good jump in battery life. 4GB of RAM is more then enough for anything you might throw at it as ultimately, the CPU (and GPU) speed would become a bottleneck. There are three USB 2 connectors which should be plenty for most situations.   Unfortunately, there are no high speed connectors like USB 3 or eSATA but I found it to be less critical in notebooks compared to, let's say, desktops. HDMI out is a great feature as you can connect this laptop to any digital monitor or TV (some monitors would require HDMI-DVI cable for the connection) without any loss of resolution and clarity. There is a nifty Memory Card reader to quickly upload pictures from the digicam.    The built-in DVD reader can also burn DVDs and notebook includes software to assist you with these tasks. You can't play Blu-Ray movies on this laptop though, as this configuration is usually not included in the low cost models.  There is not much bloatware that comes with a laptop. There are few ASUS programs that help with management and face recognition and few trial versions of software from other vendors that you can quickly ditch in preference of the free source alternatives.   The included Webcam is sufficient for video-conferencing and can handle a variety of light situations with not much difficulty. The laptop is not light but also is not too heavy and for the size of the screen it is what you would expect.   I found speakers to be adequate. Some reviewers commented on poor sound quality but I guess it comes with expectations. Good sound comes with air volume. It is difficult and expensive to create quality speakers in small package. In sample music and video that I played on the laptop sound came clear and loud enough for close listening and this is as much as I would expect from any general purpose notebook.   You should not plan on installing and playing video games on this laptop. It can handle simple flash-based games without a problem and can still run some older (3-5 years old) games quite all right, but without a dedicated GPU anything more would be more that this laptop can handle.    Overall, I can not recommend this laptop. One can live with poor screen and weak battery, knowing that this is the price you have to pay to get laptop under $500. But cheap keyboard outweigh any advantages of getting good Intel CPU inside. You simply can not rely on it to last you long in heavy use scenario and any positive impression anyone would have seeing the laptop for the first time would quickly dissipate once they try to type on it.    P.S. I had a chance to test this laptop against identically configured Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 (available on this site for the same price as of now). I can tell you right away that keyboard on Toshiba is better by a large margin. Great tactile response, built-in light indicators, physically separated directional keys, etc. Also, Toshiba, while having the same 48Wt battery lasted 1hr 15min more in the video test (2 hours in Asus vs 3hr 15min for Toshiba for identical video with same brightness, Wi-Fi turned-off, CPU throttling set to the same percentage and all background processes shut down.) Asus was continually drawing more current which I attribute to a more efficient LCD on Toshiba (TruBrite LED-Backlit display). I could see this difference in battery in other tests too. Toshiba lasted me the whole day in light usage while Asus quickly drained battery even with screen fully dimmed.",

I waited until Apple updated to IOS 8.1.3 thinking the newer OS would possibly address the Bluetooth issue. It did not. I have been using this keyboard for about a day now. It has lost connectivity at least a dozen times, forcing me to go to settings, forget the device and type in the new code numbers to re-generate the Bluetooth link. Twice I have had to totally reboot my iPad to get connected. Even with all of these issue I plan to keep the keyboard. It is far superior to any of the others I have tried. The construction of the keyboard, the magnetic attachment process, the keyboard strokes, the multi-functioning numeric keys, the mutiple Bluetooth device ability and compactness of the case with the iPad attached are enough for me to put up with the Bluetooth issue for now. Hey Belkin if you're listening and reading these reviews how about addressing this issue?<br /><br />February 8, 2015<br />For those readers who believe your plea goes unheard please review the comments regarding the review posted above. Belkin commented and invited me to contact them with issues mentioned in my review. At this time my connectivity issue has not rematerialized, but I shall act on Belkin's invitation to correct the issue if it does reoccur. I'm impressed with Belkin's response and encouraged with my Keyboard 's current lack of connectivity issues. I will comment later as to the status of this issue.<br /><br />February 20, 2015<br />Mutiple connectivity issues on a daily basis.

They are just too tiny and I find even with my rather slender fingers I often hit two keys at the same time.<br /><br />2. The portion of the case that allows it to &#34;clip&#34; onto the tablet is directly in front of the space bar, making the space bar difficult to get to.<br /><br />Otherwise, I found the unit to be well constructed.  The keys had good action, felt solid.  It doesn't feel cheap, it feels like a quality keyboard.  I've typed on worse.  It is just too small folks.  I can't recommend this even for people with small hands, the virtual keyboard is faster and more accurate, especially if you learn to use the swype action on the virtual keyboard.<br /><br />I think the key for a small keyboard like this is to make better use of the space, like the Zagg Folio for the Note 8.0, it uses much more of the available space for keys and actually has space between keys.",

The range is not the best, but it was adequate for my 1300 sq/ft 2 story home (basement and ground level). Out side, it left alot to be desired. I couldn't connect on my phone or tablet in the driveway or back yard. The router was wall mounted in a closet, central to the house, upstairs.<br /><br />Stability with the WiFi seems to be an issue that Netgear just can't get under control. Do a search for this router and you will come across page after page of owners who can't keep a wifi connection for more than a day. Mine would usually drop once a day and I would have to disconnect and reconnect the devices in the house to resume use. This was especially troublesome with my Nest thermostat. Trying to turn the ac or heat on and off was a crap shoot at best. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.<br /><br />This issue has been going on since I bought the router 12/2011. I have tried every version of the firmware that Netgear released and not one has been able to fix it. Just to make sure it wasnt my cable modem (SB6120) I connected an old WRT54G. Service was rock solid and NEVER dropped. Put the WNDR-3800 back into service and all the problems came back.<br /><br />The wired side of this router has been rock solid from day 1.I have never had a problem with the 2 TV's I have hard wired, or the 2TB drive I have connected to the router via USB. It streamed HD video to my Samsung TV's without a hiccup. I have never had a problem accessing the drive via the ReadyShare Cloud app on my Galaxy S3 phone while away from home.<br /><br />All the problems are with the wireless stability. Netgear has released firmware updates to no avail. They have recently EOL'ed (End Of Life) this router too, which means no more firmware, no more updates, and they are done trying to fix the problem with this router.<br /><br />It should be noted that even the replacement for this router (WNDR-4300) and the top tier 4500 are having similar issues and nobody seems to be able to fix it, even Netgear. As they have EOL'ed this router, it likely will never get fixed.<br /><br />This week, the router finally died (a blessing in disguise). I was surfing the web, before bed, everything was good. I woke up and found I had no WiFi conncetion. Standing next to the router the best signal I could get was -93dbm. A connection that was so low, it was unuseable. Tried a bunch of things, firmware, DDWRT, Tomato and nothing helped. It seems to be a hardware failure. Which I'm ok with cause now I got an asus RT-N66U and its clearly the router I should have got the first time.<br /><br />After the failure, I started looking into other routers and found that Netgear has a long lineof issues when it comes to wireless stability. I don't consider myself a \\\\\"power user\\\\\", I only have 4 devices connected to WiFi at any given time (2 laptops win7 and win8 and two Galaxy S3's). This router should be able to handle the light load I place on it. Instead, it failed with 0 support from netgear. Never again Netgear. Never. Again.<br /><br />If your looking for a router with the same features (including the remote access to a USB drive), longer range, faster speeds, and a STABIL connection, get the Asus RT-N66U. The range is amazing, and the WiFI is rock solid.

For not much more money they could have put in much better. While he had it open, I told him to replace all the capacitors with better ones -- the parts weren't expensive.<br /><br />Recently, the output has crapped out again -- only getting the left channel. I don't know what the problem is and can't fix it. Looking for a new card. I don't think I'll be using M-Audio.",

I currently use a Blackwidow Ultimate (gen1), Mamba mouse, and a Goliathus extended.<br /><br />Build: (1/5)<br />They are built fairly well, a lot of plastic running everywhere which never really is a good thing, but its not cheep plastic.<br />The over head band was clunky and the bonded leather &#34;pleather&#34; seemed to be cracking from just opening the box.  The Microphone stays far out of the way when you want it hidden and the split adapter that comes with it is nice. The &#34;folding&#34; they advertise doesn't really do anything, the headphone drivers just end up sitting on each other in the center, not a lot of regained room by folding them.<br /><br />Sound: (2/5)<br />Compared to Sony MDR-V7506 @$99.99<br />These headphones were a total joke. The lows are so over saturated it made the mids and highs sound so far out of place. I found that people with normally high voices (Pentatonix) had voices several octaves lower. Overall it changed the way the music was experienced and not in a good way. I'm sure if you were listening to nothing but trance music you wouldn't mind, but voices are so bad on these.<br /><br />Comfort: (1/5)<br />I wore these for around four hours and found the left side going out frequently. The pads on the side (again pleather) seemed to stick to my head more. I would have liked to have seen a softer pad to relieve this.<br /><br />Test Music:<br />Lindsey Sterling - Shatter Me<br />Pentatonix - Daft Punk mix<br /><br />Overall: (2/5)<br />In the end i wouldn't recommend these, for the price they have overly low lows and terrible mids and highs.<br />Your better off getting a headset made from a company that's dedicated to music, not making things flashy and green (no offense Razer, i still love you)",

The case is nice, it does have a funny smell when it's new, it isn't the greatest at illuminating the entire kindle page but it does an ok job.    So, my kindle seemed to be losing battery life really quickly and would be drained completely after I was sure I'd turned it off. I thought maybe the light was draining the battery when it was turned off.  So, then my Kindle started acting funny and I would have to restart it, turn it on/off several times to get it to work properly, this caused all my books to get erased (normal but a pain!) and folders I had attempted to organize my books into.   So, I figure out the Kindle acts fine if the case was not attached.      I called amazon and they sent me out a free replacement case even though this just happened and I had purchased the kindle at xmas (amazing!!!).  So, last week I got the new case and I attached the case and set my kindle down on my bed to charge.  I came back later and went to get on my kindle and the screen was broken.      So, another call to amazon and they sent out a free replacement kindle with instructions to send the other back...  So, the new kindle arrives.  I register it, then attach the case and read on it for about 20 minutes.  I then adjusted my hand grip and I hear a \\\\\"pop.\\\\\"  The screen cracked again!!!!  2nd Kindle bites the dust!!!  Very frustrated. This doesn't definitively prove the case is bad but I am not going to risk it again and it's the only common denominator. I hope amazon is as amazing this time around when I call in for the 2nd replacement kindle in less than a week.  I wish the kindle tech support would have warned me or something when I called for the replacement kindle...  \\\\\"Oh, the case you have might be faulty...\\\\\"  Even though it was a replacement case...",

You could exchange the \\\\\"kindle location\\\\\" with other users of the device, but that's not going to get you very far in a footnote.  It is really rather remarkable that Amazon designed a reading device that is functionally worthless for what would seem to be a potential core market: editors, academics, and others who read for a living.   Indeed, this flaw suggests that too many techies and not enough readers/writers designed the kindle.  And while it rapidly became a cliche to refer to the kindle as a 1.0 device, the phrase is as apt as it is overused.  It's such an easy software fix that I'm almost tempted to hold onto mine until the proper patch emerges -- almost but not quite.",

I was really impressed with the performance campared to the price.<br />Everything looked good, but I get more disapointed everyday. I'd just like to go through a list of some of the issues I've had so far.<br /><br />The screen resolution is a little too low for my taste. This is mostly my fault for picking out a notebook that is very portable. It is/was comparable to everything else on the market, but hopefully the market will dictate better screens in the future.<br /><br />The Battery life is noticebly shorter than what they claim, even more so after installing an SSD. I guess that is expected though, and it isn't really a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />The wireless on this machine is mediocre. I don't have much trouble with the speed, but the range is not so great compared to other similarly specced machines I have used in the same building.<br /><br />I have yet to successfully burn a CD or DVD. I have tried a dozen different formats and brands with different burning software, but it always fails. It also has trouble reading discs burned on other systems, often times stalling out and refusing to spin.<br />I sent the machine into HP after going through troubleshooting over the phone, and it was with them for just over three weeks. About mid way through, HP called to tell me they were waiting on parts, I assured them I could wait. When the laptop was returned to me, no parts had been replaced, but the BIOS had been updated to a version not available via the drivers download page. The burner still does not work.<br />They did happen to send me Factory Recover Media. These DVDs do not work either becuase the drive will not read them properly, or the software used to customize the DVDs is terrible. Either way, I currently could not reinstall the copy of Windows 7 that was provided.<br /><br />UEFI and BIOS are very restricted, only allowing code signed by HP to run. As far as I can tell, all of thier business line notebooks allow the use of unsigned code, but this feature has been stripped out of this notebook. I would like to boot windows 8 using UEFI to take full advantage of the features, but that is seemingly unatainable. I was going to update the firmware on my SSD while reinstalling windows, but that is also not possible because HP has disallowed running the disk in IDE mode while disabling almost all options in the BIOS.<br /><br />The HP Quickweb feature wasn't a selling point to me, but I would like to mention that it is slow to load, almost defeating the purpose it is supposed to serve. I seem to remember that in older versions(on other models), you could boot into windows right from Quickweb without shutting down, but this model/software requires a cold reboot.<br /><br />I would like to add that I haven't had any issues with the keyboard and the ports are spaced conveniently around the case. Nothing gets blocked by using a mouse, printer, ethernet, or output display. Hinges are nice, feel solid.<br /><br />If you happen to make it through this giant rant/review, consider yourself warned against purchasing HP notebooks.",

Our primary server had 10 1TB Seagate hard drives - new drives with 32mb caches (1.2 msec. read seek time, 1.0 write seek time - NICE).  After about a month of testing we deployed the server in production.  A week later we discovered CATASTROPHIC data loss on the controller's RAID6 array.  With our server vendor's assistance, we isolated the problem to the controller's lack of support for hard drives with 32mb cache.    We tried to work with Adaptec to resolve the problem with a BIOS firmware update, but their front-line support was very rude and condescending.  They refused to acknowledge the problem, even though our server vendor told us that they'd gotten a CONFIRMATION from Adaptec that the problem was known and that a firmware update was pending that would resolve the problem.  AND Adaptec charged us $75 just for the front-line support call!    We switched to an LSI Logic 84016E RAID controller, and so far we're much happier.  The documentation is more detailed & easier to read, their customer support has been more friendly & MUCH more helpful, AND on top of all that the card's less expensive.  We haven't deployed this card into production yet, but I have high hopes that it'll perform more reliably!    Bottom line:  the Adaptec 31605 RAID controller card appeared to have very high performance, and the setup utility is easy to use.  But if you're using it with recently-manufactured hard drives (32mb cache), BE AWARE that this card may not be reliable!  It probably works fine when the RAID array's made of hard drives with 16mb caches (i.e, old drives), but we've lost too much time recovering from our data loss to care.",

I love the cordless optical trackman (2nd generation to me).  When I first bought my first trackball, I wanted to return it...it took over 3 days to get use to it and love it.  I waited over 2 weeks of use of the M570 trackball before writing this review.  I don't like it for 1 major reason that is very frustrating.  I didn't think much of it at first, but moving the trackball from using the index and middle finger to using the thumb is a very bad idea.  The reason is that with 2 fingers, the user has precise control and stability: with the thumb, the user only has control.  If the user of the M570 uses this trackball for precise pointer control such as CAD work, solidworks, schematic capture, or  photo editing I highly doubt anyone would like this product.  When I use my thumb to move the pointer in combination to using left mouse click, the pointer moves 1 or 2 pixels.  It's very frustrating when the user needs precise pointer movement.  Many times I want to left click (index finger) and use my thumb to click and drag and I often off by 1 so my connection is off...never had a problem with my optical trackman.<br /><br />The positive points about the M570 is use of the new tiny usb receiver.  Just like my other logitech products it connects and seamlessly works.<br /><br />So any gamer, CAD, or photo editing, I suggest waiting or using the optical trackman.  For casual web browsing and such it will suffice.  For reference, I keep the M570 at work and the optical trackman still at home.  I am still forcing myself to muscle train my thumb...but really the ability to use fingers 2 to 3 of them to control a pointer is far better than 1 thumb.",

This machine is not up to IBM standards, and do not expect IBM quality.<br />It is quiet, and has a nice display. However, the most used input device on a notebook PC is the mouse, which in this case is a touch pad. This is the worst touch pad I have ever used!  You will try all the settings and never get it to work correctly.  Just try doing a right click on the background to set display resolution and the background picture. On my Sony Windows 7 notebook this is trivial. On the Lenovo touchpad it is nearly impossible- this thing will not recognize right click! Try to create a short cut on the desk top to your favorite programs- sorry- not possible on this machine!<br />This touch pad does not have true buttons. Instead, it relies on pressing a certain area of the touch pad. I still can not locate where that area is, so good luck with your experiments in trying to get this to work.  It will go back in the box and I will now consider other brands of PC, such as Toshiba. Lenovo has now killed what used to be the BEST notebook brand in the world.<br />I did note that battery life seems to be OK, and the weight is acceptable.  My machine came with a 256 GB solid state hard drive, and this is a nice touch for faster system operation. It should also help the battery last longer, as spinning a hard drive takes a fair amount of energy.<br />The ultimate solution to making this machine useable is to forget about the touch pad interface, and purchase a nice USB / wireless mouse or external touch pad. Now you can use this machine and make some serious progress on all your computer work. It just means when you travel with this PC you must carry along another piece of hardware- a working mouse.",

Like the Drobo drives, DroboShare requires no setup.    SMB might be a suitable protocol for a Windows environment, but it is a very questionable choice of protocol for a Mac. DroboShare advertising states that you can switch a drive at any time to USB/Firewire and back to DroboShare. Physically that is true; however, when you create files over SMB, the Mac's data and resource forks are placed in separate files, but when you create files over USB, there is only one file. If you create a file over SMB the archive bit will be set -- once you see the file over USB, you will find that it has turned into a Unix executable file, i.e., double-clicking the file in the Mac finder might have unexpected results...    Bottom line: if you don't move your drive around (e.g., for faster transfer) and if you just store simple files (e.g., music or pictures) the DroboShare might be ok for a Mac; if you plan to put your home directory on a network drive the DroboShare might not be what you really want.",

BAR NONE! I actually cried when the plug broke because I haven't yet heard speakers that sound this good. I then purchased the &#34;Logitech&#34; speaker system, and immediately returned it. It sounded HORRIBLE! All bass and NO treble or middle. I use the speakers for music listening, and those were more for gaming. I didn't want to go through THAT again, and I've learned that you stick with the tried and true, and I didn't think they even made the Altec Lansing speakers anymore, (that model) but I decided to take a look on Amazon, and lo! and behold! there they were! And for way less than what I first paid for them! Well, I hurried up and ordered them, got them today, and what a freakin let down. I hadn't even unpacked it good, and noticed one of the &#34;feet&#34; on the sub-woofer was CRACKED and there was no way it could even be glued back on or fixed. The feet were also dingy and yellow like it had been sitting on the shelf for YEARS and got dry. I got the feeling also that it may have been something someone returned, and they repackaged it and sold it. Needless to say, I am really bummed. I'm not going to try to get this system again, so I'll just keep trying to find speakers just as good. I do NOT want Bose, just a set of reasonably priced decent sounding computer speakers. And to be honest, these speakers to me sound BETTER than Bose. So clearly they stopped making these speakers and are just trying to get rid of all the ones that are left. So pass on these, they sound awesome, but that pin plug is defective from the start but I wanted them so bad I was going to ignore that.

This Access point is by far the worst networking product I have ever had the displeasure of using.  I purchased it for a client because it was the only Access Point I could find locally.  When I went to set it up it requires that you use the included CD.  There is no default IP address to configure it manually.  I popped the CD in and started the configuration process, between each step is a long wait while it churns away.  After I was done with the setup I tried to connect and verify it worked.  It would not pass DHCP packets no matter what I did, I was eventually able to set an IP address and do some manual configuration and still no IP address on the wireless. I could switch to my other wireless access point with no problems at all.  I finally downloaded the latest firmware and installed it,  Finally I was able to get an IP address and access the internet.  Confident that the firmware update had fixed the problem I box it back up and send it to my client.  The next day the client goes to install it on the network (ie... plug it in) No IP address, No response to Pings from the wired side and now No SSID broadcast.  Despite resetting the device 3 or 4 times and verifying that everything was installed correctly it still refuses to work.

Biggest problem for me is, the \\\\\"whispersync\\\\\" technology is very buggy, it does not sync the last read position at all across my Kindle Touch and the Kindle app on my Windows Phone or my PC. It also had some trouble downloading the Kindle books in my Kindle library at first but I probably solved that by restarting, deregistering, and then re-registering! What's also annoying is, I borrowed a Kindle book from the Kindle Owners' Lending Library (KOLL) and when I returned it, it stays on the Home screen with the word \\\\\"Returned.\\\\\" Just unsightly! My second problem is the screen really flashes too much, to the point of being distracting as well as equally annoying. I turned on the option to refresh less between pages of a book but it still flashes more frequently than I'd have liked, and it flashes each time elsewhere in the interface. Speaking of the UI, the touch is not very responsive, and there's little feedback after you press a button or book title, so I'm never sure if I pressed the screen hard enough. Many a time I end up pressing the same spot twice or more which ends up doing unexpected things after the first press/tap actually registered. Finally, the screen is really too small to be comfortable. I have excellent vision but this strains my eyes, and the text font options are too few. One last thing, the \\\\\"email-to address\\\\\" feature is buggy, as it shows an address that is NOT mine! I was going to return my Kindle to OfficeMax but then I realized the sales clerk had lied to me: once opened, OfficeMax charges a 15% restocking fee!! I'm really not feeling good right now.",

The hardware in the upgrade kit was satisfactory, the software was not.  In over 25 years of working with computer hardware and software, rarely have I seen so many problems in a single software package.  First I tried to clone my primary system disk with windows 7 to the new solid state drive, then upgraded to windows 8 which appeared successful, until the next morning when the system wouldn't boot.  A review of the acronis knowledge base online revealed that this is a commonly documented and discussed, but unresolved, problem with the cloning feature of the Acronis software dating as far back as 2009.  Review of the Acronis website pushed for an upgrade to the True Image 2013 version with additional features available.  This was offered online for 29 dollars, i found an online coupon and purchased the upgrade for $19.00.  I then attempted to clone the drive again, without success.  I then made a backup of my original hard drive and tried to do a system restore to the SSD.  The result is that the restore files successfully copied to the ssd but the system and system image files did not leaving the drive not bootable.  The bootmgr files were not copied, for which a knowledge base search reveals that this too is a long time shortcoming of the Acronis software. I am presently on my 7th or 8th effort to remedy the problem without success.  What makes my frustration level even higher, is that upon going to the Acronis website for support I was prompted to make an account and register my product and upgrade.  At account registration I was emailed an assigned password, which I used to access my account and then changed my password to something that fits in my password system.  Now when I attempt to logonto the Acronis site it does not accept the new password or the old password, and when I request a new one through the password recovery system it fails to respond to me. I'm generally an easy to please sort of guy, but honestly,I've nothing good to say about the Acronis Software Brand as it appears to me that the company is knowingly selling a defective product, then baiting the consumer to upgrade to a product that also doesn't work all while making it exremely difficult to contact the company for assistance.  In some jurisdictions that is a crime.",

As a matter of fact the circuit board came out and was attached to the Vertex 4 256GB Drive, when I stopped trying to insert the drive into the case. Since the circuit board was attached to the Vertex when I removed it from the case, I made sure it was seated properly and cloned the HD to it using the Acronis software.  Note: I did not encounter any specific instructions as to what steps to take in cloning the SSD using the software. The data showed on the Vertex 4, but when I installed it into my system the system in place of my existing HD it started to boot up and then stopped. It appears that the clone wasn't installed properly. So, I emailed OCZ and they said I should use a dual powered USB enclosure for the transfer - the one in the kit doesn't have enough power to provide a proper transfer.  Another note is the SATA III cable they provide in the kit IS WAY TOO SHORT FOR MY DESKTOP - definitely another piece of useless junk.<br /><br />  I'm now at the following stage of this worthless SSD upgrade to my system,  I reinstalled the original HD and then installed the Vertex 4 in a second Hard Drive bay in my computer.  My system boots up with no problem using the original HD, The Vertex is sitting in the second HD bay waiting for me to install a SATA III cable that would fit from the SSD to the slot in my mother board.  When this occurs, I guess I'll try another transfer to the SSD to see if that works (OCZ thinks it stands a good chance). I'll update this if I get it to function properly.<br /><br />  The kit is a total waste, of time and money - The housing won't provide enough clearance for the Vertex 4 SSD and you should be using one with dual power especially for larger size SSD's (according to OCZ), the cable provided is far to small for use in a desk top and finally the software is not user friendly IMHO.",

Understanding that it would be impossible to buy another keyboard built with that quality, I went searching.  I decided on the Microsoft Natural Elite because of the reviews I read here.    Updated Review 8/22/2010.  Since I have now owned the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite for 5 months, I think I have a better understanding of why some of the reviews for this product were negative.  Since my purchase on March 31, I have started coding Java, and doing a lot more writing.    The spacebar has always been a problem. It sticks badly if it is hit on or near the edges.  I am also having trouble with the shift keys. Like the spacebar, it sticks badly if you don't hit it just right. This applies to both the shift keys, so it's not a defect per-se, it's a design flaw.    I have had enough of this keyboard. I am going to look for a different one at a local retailer where I can try the keyboard before I buy it. Right now, I'm thinking a Logitech. Anything but another Microsoft product!    After 5 months, I rate this keyboard unacceptable, unless you don't use it much, or have a very heavy hand. Definitely not the keyboard for writers or coders.",

That was our second mistake.  The tech support people told us that we would not have problems if we'd purchased directly from them.  \\\\\"Our firmware is better than Amazon's firmware.\\\\\"  They guaranteed next day delivery and 12 months of tech support and warranty.    Cisco (Linksys's owner) has truly disappointed me.    They did offer to let me send them the device I'd bought from Amazon.  Then, I'd have to wait \\\\\"a few business days\\\\\" for them to send me a \\\\\"better unit.\\\\\"  I offered to let them charge my credit card as much as they wished, so that I'd have something to use until the replacement arrived.  (Then, I would return the unit and let them credit me back when they had the replacement device in hand.)  They refused.    This is just unacceptable.  Buy any other router from any other company.  This has cost me three days of my time, and it's not worth it to me.      OKAY!  This is an edit I'm making on April 24th at nearly 10 PM Eastern.    I cannot believe that I'm going to say this, but I've spent more than 15 hours with their technical support, and they only get worse with each call.  We now get 2 MBPs of signal when we are 70 feet away.    What does Linksys say about this?  \\\\\"Well, do not worry about this.  Wait 48 hours and the software modifications will improve the signal.  We have gone in there and modified the software some more, and it will be a very good signal in two days.\\\\\"    ARE THEY INSANE?    Has Cisco/Linksys come up with some heuristic program that will learn how to bounce signals off my walls?    I am even more frustrated because my son, who builds systems and software for a living, had gotten the broadcast up to 20 MBPs before I called Linksys.  They told me that he was incorrect in using the Range Expander (which they'd told me to buy), and that everything will be fine when the software has a chance to do its magic.    Now, I will come back with a huge apology if this thing somehow generates a better signal in 48 hours.  But I'll bet you a ticket to Bangalore that it ain't getting any better.    These guys must get paid by the minute.........  ==================================================================================================================  I waited 48 hours.  There was no \\\\\"magical fix.\\\\\"    This time, I chose CHAT for tech support.  The CSR laughed about the experiences I've had and told me that the WRE54g was not compatible to extend the range of this device.  He told me to go buy a WAP54g.    Are they serious?  No, they won't offer any consideration.  I'm going to call Amazon to see if they will let me return this after all of the aggravation.  Time to find another company.  Belkin?

I went to their software downloads page for firmware or diagnostic downloads...  The page had categories listed with &#34;filler text&#34; of nonsense words!  There were no links to ANY drivers, firmware updates, diagnostic tools, etc...  NONE!  Do yourself a favor and avoid this unit, if not for today's computing needs but for your needs 8 months later.  My original review is below, written in December of 2014.     - Haven't had it long enough to complain about a short life BUT I can say that I was disappointed upon opening the package...  I have bought two 40GB SSDs before at much lower-per-gig prices than this and BOTH of them had adapter trays (so that it could be installed in a 3.5&#34; bay).  Also, both of them came with screws and connector cables for power (4-pin to SATAs) and data!!!  Case sounds and looks like it is plastic, I didn't dare do anything to confirm or deny that but (as with my other two being in aluminum shells) I do believe that heat dissipation is a concern.  Can't say that Patriot seems to be concerned about heat as there is no real mass to the casing even if it were metal.  So, if you're installing it in a desktop, expect to spend another $10-$20 for a tray, screws and connectors (depending on where you get it).  If you're putting it in a laptop, you wouldn't be buying such a small drive anyway...  More like a 240GB or 120GB Patriot Blaze would be like it.  The only reason I am keeping it is that I needed more space on my OS drive as I've installed some programs that require residency on the OS drive (I now run 4 drives, three SSDs and one &#34;analog&#34; as I call it).",

NVidia may have flaws, but from my experience the cards work reliably and as advertised. AMD failed to perform. Right out of the box the card worked amazingly, but less than a month later I started having multiple issues. My computer would BSOD while playing half of my games. I know the card is designed to run hot but I suspected that this might be part of the problem. Opening up the driver control panel I increased max fan speed to 100%, dropped the max temperature by 10 degrees, and underclocked the GPU by 10%; I paid a ridiculous amount to over, not underclock my card. This completely eliminated the rage-fueling-random BSOD problem; unfortunately a new problem quickly popped-up. Without even running a game or stressing the GPU the driver would crash constantly. This crash would result with the screen turning black and staying so for roughly five minutes (usually enough time for me to force a shutdown out of frustration) until eventually the poorly written driver had time to restart. I\u2019ve spent hours researching the problems I have experienced and nothing seems to make this card even slightly more reliable or consistent. I\u2019ve had great experiences with both companies in the past but for now I\u2019ll be running a 780 while waiting for AMD\u2019s next big move.",

DX more expensive (ok i know it bigger) but cannot do as the cheaper models !!<br /><br />Other bad things, you should be aware:<br /><br />- No WiFi, you have to aware to be charged for fee if you use DX's wireless (3G).<br /><br />All of these missing functionalities, you can find it in Chinese e-readers (I never have one but I found some blogs talking about that)<br /><br />- Oh, one more thing, I never see any reviews mention about this. Although e-ink looks exactly the same as paper, it has 'too good' surface. What does it mean? it means the screen is a bit shinny (yea, it is 'Pearl', then it is shinny, isn't it?), then sometime it reflex more light than paper to your eyes. For me, sometime I feel pain in my eyes. I recommend you to try your friend'sKindle before buy one.",

Finally, the tech showed me how to reset the password (holding the reset button in, while unplugging the unit, waiting 20 seconds, plugging it back in, ALL THE WHILE holding the reset button in with a pencil, then releasing it).  After that ordeal, I was able to get the PrintServer portion working, but it would not connect to my ISP (Bellsouth FastAccess).  After several attempts, I finally exchanged that unit for an identical one, which did connect to my ISP on the 1st try.  THIS time though, the PrintServer portion would only work 1 out of 5 times and that was after rebooting the unit and my PCs!!!  I re-installed the D-Link DI-704 model which doesn't have the PrintServer and this one works like a charm (I've had it for a year now).  It also has an on/off switch which is handy for when you need to restart it, you don't have to unplug anything, just flick the switch.  As for the printing, it is MUCH more reliable to just hook the printer straight into your server which is always running, and share it.  From the client machine, just select network printer and point to the server and it works 100% of the time.  But the D-Link 704P was just not reliable enough for me.",

If you follow the manual carefully the accounts and finger prints are fairy easy to setup but this where the true problems start to show.    Now here is where it really SUX... the software crashed, i.e. failed to save the password and freezes, 2 of 10 times.  Yes, that is 20% failure. And each time the computer (XP SP2) must be rebooted for the software to work again despite the documentation citing only needing to logout and logging back in.  MAJOR FAILURE.

Please pass this on to your engineers or make your software open source and we'll build the Firefox integration.      There's gotta be something good about this right?

I've set it to first read 30 minutes of books before playing any games or videos. I've noticed that my son is loving books more and is very excited to read new books every night.  - 2 year warranty    Cons:  - Coming from Ipad it does take a little getting used to but my son loves the swiping of books and apps. He said it's easier to find vs the ipad.  - It took me a while to figure out how to make the home screen appear but tapping in the middle of the screen did the trick (while reading books, have not tested videos and apps)    Switching profiles is easy, just press the power button, tap the profile icon and it should let you select the available profile.    My daughter has been begging me to buy her one too but she has to make do with our old Ipad, I'm not spending anymore $$$.    *** Update 11/4/2014    Okay we have the tablet for more than 2 weeks now, everything has been going well until we run out of storage. It was frustrating to us as we have a lot of apps to install. Not only that, there are times that I would approve an app and it would not finish downloading at all in the child's profile. It will forever have that orange/yellow status. It works fine on my profile but not on my child's profile! I added a new profile for 2nd child and whatever app I try to approve it just doesn't come up in her profile.    I wanted to love this, I do but the 4 gb usable storage is just not cutting it for us plus there are still a lot of bugs to be fixed for this tablet. I am downgrading this to 2 stars. I instead bought a refurbished kindle fire 3rd gen with 32g, will install freetime and buy a kid proof case. That should do it for the space issue.",

Once that support comes out, the tray is flimsy and difficult to work with until the drive is secured in it.  On well-designed trays, the support doesn't need to come out; it just stays out of the way.<br /><br />I was concerned it would ventilate effectively.  There is a fan, however there's 2 small holes in the backplane to allow airflow; the fan grossly dwarfs these vent holes.  I don't see how it would cool the drives at all and I didn't get to find out...<br /><br />...and here's why: I installed the cage in my media server, hooked power up to it and mounted 3 drives in their trays.  I slid the trays in and powered up.  I heard the SNAP.  My case fans twitched.  Then nothing happened.  The machine wouldn't even power up.  Trouble shooting revealed the three drives just over a year old were no longer working.  They were fried by (my best guess) a voltage overage or a short in the cage.<br /><br />I just shipped this back to the seller with an RMA.  I'm thankful for that.  However, what about the $300 in drives I'm out?  I contact Icy Dock who put it as nicely as they could: sounds like your problem.  They maintain they stand by their product, however they won't go as far as to replace the drives.  That makes me a little angry.  I can only urge you stay away from these guys and everything they sell.  I bought a product in good faith it would work, but it caused damage to my property and I'm left paying for it.<br /><br />If you want a great analogy as to what can happen to you with this device, watch Tommy Boy.  You know, where he explains what happens if his client buys inferior brakes: a fiery car crash with kid screaming and the manufacturer of those brakes just shrugs.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm off looking for a different product and 3 new hard disks.

I have rather big hands and I was surprised with the heft of this mouse.    The first night with the mouse began with trouble right off the bat.  My software kept crashing when I tried to open it.  I, uninstalled, re-downloaded, and then I was able to open it in wireless mode only.  The software was glitchy and synapse memory saving painfully slow.  It seemed as if everything needed to write to the synapse memory even if just closing a menu with no changes.  However, in the middle of gaming, my Mamba software crashed and was nice enough to put me to the desktop to tell me.  At this point, I decided to try the wired mode after a reboot and could not open the software as it would say that it could not detect the mouse, but the mouse saved much of the settings and in wired mode, felt okay to use.  Going wireless solved this problem of getting back into the software, but I was left me scratching my head.    One odd item is that I could not find an option in the software to use 5600 dpi and lower the mouse pointer speed.  Other mice put the windows slider in there to make it easy to adjust.  I personally like to use full DPI available andadjust the speed of the pointer to suit my taste.  I feel this enhances precision in games and the DPI is sort of what I am paying for.  This software uses DPI as the speed and I thought this was silly.  When my software crashed, the mouse would be extremely slow and a pain to use.           Second day, bad problems began.  I had charged the mouse overnight to make sure the battery was fully charged.  I could almost live with the software issues with the hope that they could be ironed out.  The real issues began when getting the freezing of the mouse reminiscent of my G7 years back.  My hope was that this mouse with its \\\\\"advanced\\\\\" channel scanning feature would be different that the G7 experience I had (note: G7 worked for months before the freezing.  I thought it was broken at the time and not environment related).  I, uninstalled, re-downloaded, and installed multiple times.  I tried nearly every USB port in the back of the computer and it would work for a second and freeze for 5 seconds.  I tried syncing it and everything I could think of.  There was nothing online to help to give me any direction.  Razer's site is not helpful and a bit too self promoting.  I uninstalled the Mamba and reinstalled the Death Adder and had no issues at all with that mouse.  My conclusion was that there were some defects with either the mouse or software or both.  The only thing I did not seem to have problem with was packing it up and sending it back to Amazon.      Summary  Overall, I had a bad experience with this mouse.  Will it happen to you? Who knows.   Since most reviews online I have read seem to be slam dunks (makes me question the source honestly), I think the odds could be in your favor.  I might just have issues with the 2.4ghz frequency where I live since the G7 gave me the same type of problem after 6 months.  One other thing noted often about other products is that Razer support is weak.  They responded to my detailed account of what happened, but the response was \\\\\"try a different USB port on the mainboard directly\\\\\".  I asked if others had the same problem and whether it could be fixed with update etc.  No responses to those questions only the try other USB ports, which I already did.  I did not have the patience to \\\\\"hope\\\\\" it would be fixed later on.    The packaging is nice and I had people from all around me at work marvel at it.  You really need to see this in person to appreciate it.  However, I would rather have simple clamshell packaging and save a few bucks in the process.      The mouse has great potential and I wanted to love it.  I rate it 2 stars for the apparent build quality and the packaging.  I am not trying to bash Razer.  If you read my reviews, you will see that the Death Adder is thought of highly by me.  I also have a Tarantula keyboard that I like a lot, so I do like Razer products.  However, this experience was so bad in so many ways, I was shocked and disappointed with them.  I ended up sending mine back to Amazon for a full refund of everything including return shipping.  So I did not lose any money in the process.  This is why Amazon is my go to retailer for almost anything that I can wait a day or two to get.  They stand behind what they sell and treat the customer properly.  In the end, I wanted a mouse with more buttons than my Death Adder.  I eventually went with the G9 and generally pleased with it and had no problems whatsoever installing and using it.  Looks like Razer will have to win back my loyalty from Logitech, again.",

            "input": "Just finished rebooting a third time and -at last!- I'm free of the program with which this deceptively harmless-looking Airlink dongle infected my machine.  This review refers to AirLink 101 N 150 Ultra.<br /><br />Let me backup, please.  I am not a computer person accept by necessity. I hate working on them, but I spend a lot of time doing it, even with new PC machines, recent software and redundant antivirus programs.  Every once in a while, some sneak slips under my guard and fouls the computer.  I believe this airlink is such a sneak and if I am right, what it did on my machine, it will do to yours [or may have already].<br /><br />Perhaps no one else has found this to be a problem?  If it is a problem to others, please confirm this review so that others may know.  Here's what happened:<br /><br />Bought the Airlink 101 mini N dongle, put it in a free USB port and... XP \\\\\"found new hardware,\\\\\" but had no luck in its search for drivers on the web.  So I loaded the CD that came with the dongle and used it to download drivers- innocently letting the \\\\\"install\\\\\" run.  I am directed by the software to restart.<br /><br />After the restart, I connect to web, OK so far, although suddenly the net seemed running much slower than before.  On inspection, I see in my system tray a bold new icon.  What's that?  I click on it. \\\\\"Intel Rapid Resource Technology\\\\\" had been installed on my machine.  What the..?<br /><br />I have my computer connected to an older Alpha antenna that is not enabled for N protocal [these antennas are an excellent way to boost receptivity and speed of access, available through Amazon].  Foolishly I thought the N dongle would in some way act to augment reception from the Alpha.  Instead, it took over from the Alpha, set up a \\\\\"Network Connection\\\\\" of its own- ok, I understand the need for that now, BUT- in establishing itself on my machine, this dongle also added this \\\\\"Rapid Resource\\\\\" software: this program had also ingratiated itself in my startup programs;it was hogging resource.<br /><br />I decide to get rid it, there goes another 15$ wasted; but that's when the trouble started.<br /><br />Many of the best programs come with \\\\\"uninstall\\\\\" as part of their set-up menus. Not this thing.  Before going to \\\\\"Add/Remove Programs,\\\\\" just in case, I went to the net to google \\\\\"how to remove Intel Raped Resource Technology.\\\\\"<br /><br />I downloaded the instructions on how to remove, the instructions being from Intel itself- a full 7 pages of them. Intel's instructions for its removal begin with this ominous warning: \\\\\"...Removing the Rapid Resource Technology driver may require reinstallation of the operating system.\\\\\"<br /><br />Gulp.<br /><br />I did a full backup before doing anything more.  Then, I followed Intel's instructions for removal- and also performed an Uninstall from XP's Add/Remove software page- then I restarted and, still following Intel's instructions, I entered the machine's bios, not without trepidation.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I did as directed to the bios; then, restarted again...<br /><br />Lo! It's all there, my o/s, programs, data, configuration in tact, and this usurper is gone.  Just in case, I ran a registry cleaner [which found several objects the uninstall had left behind], and then completed a full virus sweep.<br /><br />As I say, please, I am obviously not a technology person.  My moral in terms of a computer: \\\\\"If it ain't broke...\\\\\"  Veer from that dictum at your peril.  In this case, the N dongle cost me a little money and a lot of time.<br /><br />You can save yourself both:<br />keep your start-up menu clean, your system tray uncluttered and your registry unsullied-plus, get faster internet speeds: take a look at the Alpha antenna. One model of the Alpha sets up N capability, so you get N speeds along with much enhanced receptivity, but be sure to buy the right Alpha for your situation- as I say, the antenna will, almost certainly, greatly enhance both your range and your speed [read the reviews posted on Amazon for the antenna].  [Disclosure: I am NOT associated with Alpha or any computer-ware; but I am elated when I find a computer gizmo that actually works, and works well]<br /><br />The Alpha will install itself without taking over your computer's bios and without cluttering your system tray and, there is no time drag from the added start-up program when next you start your machine.<br /><br />The Alpha is small, light and portable- though certainly much bigger than this mini dongle.  This mini is small all right, but doesn't matter if it's invisible, I don't want it in charge of my computer.<br /><br />As with all computer lessons, I learned the hard way to upgrade my antenna rather than install over it.  The Alphalink Mini is in the trash.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I just read the review posted here June 17, 2012, by Thad.<br />Perhaps following Thad's advice [searching for drivers on the net rather than off the CD] will spare you from having your bios manipulated by the software on the CD.  I have not changed my one star rating, since I can only review from my own experience and I doubt I am alone in considering it safe to access program and drivers from the Mini's accompanying CD.",

The problem I had was everything seems to be a software issue and they won\u2019t tell you even when you ask a very specific question as I did if this type of issues is hardware or software. Several times during our conversation I was asked to purchase their addition service plan for them to answer my questions and resolve my issues. Towards the end they did state that if the issue did turn out to be a hardware issue I could request a refund of the money I paid for the service. Again I told them I wasn\u2019t interested because I already had an extra warranty with a third party vendor so if my issue wasn\u2019t covered I would use them.<br />In fairness to Netgear, it seems they farm out their customer service to people who are reading from a book and do not have the expertise to verify from the script. A lot of companies now do this. From my view the main drive for the two CS people who were helping me was to upsell me to their extra cost service plan<br />Eventually I did resolve my issue. In my case I tried to reset unit per page 166 which is hold reset in for 7 seconds. I did this on three separate occasions and you do see the led\u2019s change and it appears the unit resets but the unit did not work. After doing a lot of reading and discussing the issue with a knowable friend, I decided to hold the reset button in for 30 seconds. It shut down, rebooted and all is well and working now. Only Netgear can tell us if there is a difference between a 7 second and 30 second reset. I also have to be aware that maybe my 7 seconds and their 7 seconds are not the same. I did not use a timer. I am trying to be fair. I do want to thank Netgear for offering to help after I posted my complaint on line. I used Square Trade for my service warranty and I highly recommend you buy an extra service plan.<br />This is the best router I have ever used and highly recommend it with an extra warranty plan.<br />I can only hope at some point someone starts a class action suit due to the false advertising or Netgear starts honoring what the write on line.

Oh, and the buttons didn't work.  I managed to get the screen in place (never mind the casing still looked busted, but hey, function over form in this case).  But to top it all off, when I set everything up it didn't even work!  I contacted the seller to explain the issue - told them I'd like to return, but if they even had any other monitors for sale I would still be willing to purchase from them.  Well, no response from the seller!  So this seller A) sells broken merchandise and B) is completely unresponsive to issues.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THIS INDIVIDUAL.  Oh, and as for the brand itself...I tried to troubleshoot some stuff from the I-Inc website and it is terrible.

The RV110W also has native IPv6 support and can support up to 4 segmented virtual networks - handy for WiFi or larger rollouts.  However, once you actually install this product the failures make themselves all too apparent:<br /><br />1) 4 10/100BaseT Ethernet ports - NOT gigabit.  If you have a multi-computer SoHo install you can't / shouldn't use this as your network backbone with anything resembling modern computers as this will be the bottleneck of an internal LAN system.  A modern router with fast, rather than giga, ethernet is a no-no.<br /><br />2) painfully slow administration front end.  I haven't hit a router's configuration system this slow in YEARS.  Odd when off the shelf consumer routers put the RV110W's web config page speed to shame.<br /><br />3) *no x.x.x.255 broadcast address support*.  This is a big one - it means that anything that uses broadcast addresses, such as WoL functionality, is blocked by Cisco's firmware.  You can WoL a computer by port forwarding directly to the internal IP but it means you can't easily WoL multiple computers via a single broadcast port.  Very bad.  There is no way to bypass the x.x.x.255 broadcast block - reports that writing to the ARP table directly will only last for a while then get wiped automatically.<br /><br />4) 2x2 802.11n.  Again, sad that a number of consumer routers offer 3x3 performance.<br /><br />The QoS system does perform reasonably well, so give a plus to that, I simply put HTTP& HTTPS manual priority entries into the tables and got good throughput response.  I could wish, on a &#34;SoHo&#34; router, that WiFi WAN throughput could be set so that internal WiFi LAN speeds would not need to be throttled simply to restrict WiFI WAN usage, but maybe that is asking for a lot.<br /><br />The VLAN features are very handy if you are looking for increase security or multi-partitioned LAN configurations, and the built-in VPN endpoint might work for you (I haven't tested it yet but, again, several consumer-level routers offer the service now as well).  However, the RV110W's 10/100-only ports and broadcast blocking are a bit turn-off on a SoHo-oriented router, as they can limit overall functionality and accessibility to both remote users and internal LAN performance.<br /><br />It has the &#34;Cisco&#34; name on it but I've gotten better overall packages of cost vs. features vs performance from other products.  Not a &#34;stay away', it does work as intended, but I feel (and have experienced) better.",

I was told but support this was a hardware issue (even though the SAME thing happens on 2 of them) - they told me they would be testing and sending a new unit as of Jan 2013 - nothing.  So - now the device has wireless turned off and is acting as their CHAPER wired model.  I couldn't be more disappointed or disgusted with ZyWall and their handling of this.  I can tell you I will NEVER buy another one of their products EVER again.<br /><br />(UPDATE DECEMBER 2012) - As you can see in the comments ZyWall cared enough to reach out to me and get me in the support loop.  Still having the issue but am working with a dedicated support rep who seems to know what he's doing.  Here's to keeping my fingers crossed that we can determine the root cause of the stability issues with the WLAN.<br />------------<br />I have been running ZyWall products for years and love them because they LAST for years.  I agree with many of the other reviews here these are not your friendly \\\\\"easy to set up\\\\\" products - they carry the ISCA labs certification because they are rock solid and through that comes complexity of configuration.  Still - you can find the information you need on the web or in their support docs.<br /><br />This review is because of some unacceptable stability issues I have experienced on 2 pieces of hardware with this model and the latest firmware.<br /><br />At random intervals the wireless network will just stop.  It's there, you can see it, but it will fail to pass traffic.  There is never anything in the logs, nothing in a capture, it's like it never stopped - except there's clearly no traffic.  The hard wired network continues to function fine without issue.<br /><br />Here's the licker - any change vi the UI to the wireless configuration - no matter how small results in the wireless network becoming available again.  Change the channel - works.  Change a DHCP time-out setting - it works.  The change shows in the logs and immediately all the activity shows in the logs.  It's nuts.<br /><br />Given there's no artifact of the event there's nothing support can offer yet the event happens 1-2 times in a 24 hour period.  Second piece of hardware does the exact same thing when configured the same.<br /><br />Worst part about this is - it's a very basic configuration with the WLAN bridged to the LAN and a cable modem on the outside.  Add insult to injury - a less than fifty dollar Medialink Wireless N Router works just fine 24/7.<br /><br />Sorry ZyWall - you were my goto hardware for years...  this experience has left me with a nearly 200 dollar paperweight.tting - it works.

Add insult to injury - a less than fifty dollar Medialink Wireless N Router works just fine 24/7.<br /><br />Sorry ZyWall - you were my goto hardware for years...  this experience has left me with a nearly 200 dollar paperweight.",

However, next time I'll look for store packaging instead of bulk. I'm very dissapointed that this card didn't work, but I'd be irrate if I only bought one with a new camera to have to wait days for a replacement.  I have had great luck with SanDisk media cards in the past and would buy SanDisk again, just not in bulk packaging. There's no way of knowing the card's history with this type of packaging - it's not sealed from SanDisk or anything.  It was packaged with the rest of my purchase, including the camera.
