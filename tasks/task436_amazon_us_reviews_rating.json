            "input": "I am a Google employee and had to chance to use the device for a few months now. This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn\u2019t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven\u2019t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don\u2019t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn\u2019t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don\u2019t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that.  5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

It fell from my table onto the wood floor. I could tell by the way it sounded when it landed that it was probably going to be ok...just a light thud, no SMASH! It was fine! My iPad never leaves the Book Book!<br /><br />Just one thing to mention. The leather does scratch and stain...I love it that way as it makes it look more worn.

            "input": "Unlike the human mind, computer memory is pretty much unlimited in its capacity. A large external back-up drive makes it possible to store everything, safely, `outside the box' ... Just in case. The Seagate Free Agent is great.<br />The days of storing computer data back-up on CDs or DVDs is pretty much over. Unlike the human memory, good external hard drives are getting bigger and bigger (in capacity) and more and more reliable to use to back-up and protect your information. The Seagate Free Agent Desk 1.5TB External Hard Drive is a great example of a simply huge amount of storage space for a very reasonable price.<br /><br />The size of available hard drives, both internal and external, has increased exponentially in the years since I first put my fingers to the keyboard of my first computer, an Apple 2-E. In those days of yesteryear (the late 1970s) a reasonable hard drive was somewhere between 500 and 100mbs (1/2 - 1 GB.) Even Bill Gates thought at the time (and was much quoted as saying) that anything more than that would be silly and unnecessary for the personal PC user.<br /><br />Today, my desktop contains two internal hard drives, each 500 GBs, for a total of one `Terabyte', a word unknown to most of us only a few years ago. As more and more data is saved on them (various programs, documents, music and video files) a reliable system of backup becomes increasingly important.  In a worse-case scenario, a `crash' can destroy a HD in an irreparable instant.<br /><br />The Seagate Free Agent 1.5TB External Hard Drive allows me to back up everything on my computer without compression - a risky proposition as it involves a series of coding and decoding processes that can go awry - as its total capacity actually exceeds by a full 50% the full internal hard drive space of my DELL 530 Inspiron.<br />Set to automatically keep EVERYTHING on both internal hard drives fully backed up by updating once a week, should my computer ever go down in a flaming mass of anguished lost memories, it (or another) could be simply and straightforwardly restored to include everything I had on it by copying the Seagate backup data to new internal hard drives.<br /><br />There are a lot of these high-capacity external hard drives now available.  The Seagate Free Agent has a lot to recommend it specifically as a good choice. Cost, simplicity of operation and reliability are really the only things that really matter and with this Seagate External Hard Drive, all three criteria have been more than satisfactorily met.<br /><br />The cost is the easiest and briefest item to address.  Listed at about $200, the Seagate Free Agent can be found through multiple on line retailers for prices ranging from $99 - $150.  Like everything else, it pays to shop it around.  Whatever you pay for it, it is warranted by Seagate for a full 5 years. I don't think you could find a better or more secure value in the industry today.<br /><br />The set-up and operation is straight forward. Plugged in to AC (the adapter and connecting USB2 connecting cable are both included in the package) and plugged into the USB port, VISTA finds and loads the most current drivers, the set up screen comes up and after less than five minutes, you have set the automatic settings for frequency and for which files are to be backed up and you're ready to go.<br /><br />Again, because of the sheer size of the available hard drive (1.5 TB); this Seagate Drive will hold everything for me. I don't need to pick and choose what to back up and what not. It simply does it all and updates it, automatically, per settings that can be as frequent as one each and every day.  The initial back up took an hour or so.  The incremental updates takes only a few minutes as only new information replaces old or, if new,  is added to the backed up data.<br /><br />The design is thoughtful, technically proficient and up to snuff for most any home computer user. A brief rundown of the technical specs is as follows:<br /><br />Dimensions:<br />Width: 1.3 inches<br />Depth: 6.8 inches<br />Height: 6.9 inches<br />Weight: 2.2 pounds<br />Enclosure color: Silver<br /><br />The Seagate Free Agent can be positioned either to lay flat or to stand in its side (a stand for this purpose is also included.) There is no variation in functioning according to its orientation.<br /><br />Spindle Speed: 7200 rpm<br />Interface Transfer Rate: 480 Mbps<br />Interface: 1 X Hi-Speed USB2<br /><br />It is fully compatible with all versions of Windows from XP through the new Windows 7 OS and is compatible with both 32 and 64 bit systems. It runs quietly as there are no internal fans - the nature of its design render one unnecessary.<br /><br />Irrelevant though it may seem, this silver colored device is extremely attractive. The set up also allows for the use of an internal low energy light that shines through the template-cut Seagate logo on the front of the enclosure to highlight its presence in your work area.<br /><br />I have had and used this Seagate Free Agent 1.5TB External Hard Drive for several weeks now.  Its performance has been flawless.  More importantly, it has given me one less thing to worry about - losing information and entertainment that I have stored on my computer.  It's a great deal of insurance for the cost.  Like all insurance, it is a gamble we hope to lose (never need.) But, just in case ...<br /><br />I am aware of some critical reviews of this Seagate Hard Drive but have found the complaints to be unfounded in my own experience.<br /><br />If you are exploring a large external Hard Drive for back-up, I strongly suggest that you check out this Seagate Free Agent 1.5TB External Hard Drive. One less thing to worry about makes the whole world a better place....

I exchanged at Sam's with very little hassle, and it has been running great ever since.  Keyboard is a great size and easy to type.  It took a bit to get used to the touch pad, as it would think I was scrolling when I didn't want to.  I turned this feature off and no more problems.  Screen resolution is good.  Windows 7 runs smoothly, without any problems.  Works great as an \\\\\"extra\\\\\" PC for web surfing and light photo and music use.

I'm using it on an nVidia Quadro K2200 to support a total of 4 monitors.  If the two devices you're plugging into it are native Displayport monitors, it most likely will work without too many issues.  If they're anything else such as HDMI or DVI, chances are only one of them will work if both are the same type of connection.  My current working setup is two identical RCA HDMI TVs and two Acer V246HL monitors.  I have one Acer monitor connected directly to the Quadro card's DVI port, one RCA TV direct to the card's Displayport with an HDMI to Displayport cable, and this Accel MST hub plugged into the video card's other Displayport.  Into the MST hub, I have one RCA TV plugged in via HDMI to Displayport cable, and one Accell active Displayport to DVI adapter feeding the other Acer monitor.  This is the ONLY configuration of these four devices that would work.  I am a seasoned IT professional, and tried every assortment of connecting these four devices, with every passive and active adapter imaginable, this is the only way I could get 1920x1080 on 4 separate monitors.  Also, this hub will do strange things with EDID information.  The nVidia control panel kind of sort of knows there are four monitors but not fully in the same way as if you had four plugged straight into a video card.  If EDID matters to you in your setup, this may not be the device for you.  I had to export the EDID information of the RCA TV's plugged straight into the card actually to a text file, and tell the nVidia control panel to read it from there, because somehow the use of this MST hub caused the card to not recognize that other RCA TV on reboot, requiring a physical unplugging and replugging of that display on every reboot.  The order of which I plugged things into the video card and into the MST hub made a big difference in getting everything recognized properly.  Also, two HDMI TVs on this MST hub flat out would not work, and two DVI monitors (with either active or passive adapters or one of each) on this MST hub flat out would not work.  Also, it should be noted that it would appear that this MST hub superimposes a null audio signal onto the HDMI feed out when HDMI audio is disabled (!!!) in Windows playback devices, which is a big problem for me, because it causes the TV to think its getting audio when clearly it's not, and will not mix in the 3.5mm analog feed.  The trouble with all this newfangled Displayport stuff is that all of these caveats and technicalities are not well documented anywhere, and unfortunately the unsuspecting user like you has to turn to reviews like this for help, because you cannot just Read The (Friendly) Manual, because there isn't one.  After lots of unplugging and replugging and rebooting and whatnot, I finally have a working stable configuration, but for most users, if you are using this to go from 3 monitors to 4, you are likely better off just buying a video card with four distinct ports on it.",

I couldn't be happier with the paperwhite part.  It was difficult to read at times, especially in bed with questionable lighting with my old Kindle and I felt a lot of eyestrain.  This is a miracle from that perspective.  The only drawbacks I have found are:  1.  It is significantly smaller than my old Kindle (my old one had a keyboard as opposed to a touchscreen)  and I find it a little more awkward to hold.  2.  The touchscreen is actually a bit of a pain in the ass.  It is pretty sensitive and sometimes when I touch to turn the page it shoots forward a chapter instead of a page (which really sucks trying to find where you were at since the bottom does not display page number but &#34;location&#34;) and sometimes it brings up the dictionary (which you just have to touch again to get rid of).  Also it sometimes it brings up the main menu &#60;sigh&#62; .  I also REALLY miss the buttons on BOTH sides of the Kindle for page turning.  I like to alternate sides when I'm laying in bed reading and if I am on my right and holding with my left hand I have to switch hands to turn the page which makes it much less convenient.  I would like my buttons back.  I know everything is touchscreen now but if they could return the buttons too for page turning convenience I would be a happier Kindle owner.  All-in-all I love my Kindle and would highly recommend the paperwhite to anyone.  Also make sure you turn wifi off (put in airplane mode).  Battery lasts much longer this way and you can just turn it back on if you need to download a book.  My battery was a lot longer lasting in the old Kindle but the sacrifice for the back lighting is well worth the relatively small decrease in battery life.",

I have a 2011 iMac 21&#34; and purchased this item and it was like the heavens opened up and freedom rang free! I could very easily move the screen with very little effort. I could share what was on my screen with others without any troubles at all. Also given these are being used in both a music studio and a photo studio it made it very easy to share with onlookers as well as adjust to I could be very comfortable, I was able to move positions in my chair and a slight poke on the bottom corner of the iMac it moved to the perfect position. Anyone that sits in the same area and basically in the same position this will give you the freedom to move around, shift your weight, swivel your chair and make yourself more comfortable. All of which translates into more comfort at work or play. That was the first one I bought and it deserved a 5 star and I believe I probably even wrote a review giving it 5 stars however my conscious nagged at me until I wrote the review on the second purchase.<br /><br />Now enters my 2015 brand new 21&#34; iMac, nothing short of beautiful. I actually bought the Rain Design i360 prior to receiving my iMac which was special order so it took me a long time to receive the iMac. Unfortunately the iMac had some major issues and had to be returned as a DOA so I had to wait until they built me another special configuration iMac which again took nearly a month to receive. So at this point I had the Rain Design i360 for over 2 months before I was able to use it. I was so excited to place the new iMac into one of the many perfect RAIN products.<br /><br />It takes all of about 5 minutes to slide the iMac in and put the backing piece on then screw it down so it stays in place. I stood back to look at my beautiful setup, my (2) iMac's, Macbook Pro, and (2) Lenovo W540 Thinkpads along with other devices all built on this beautiful table I designed of glass and chrome layered on top of a solid oak table, just beautiful! Then since the iMac's are right next to each other although the thickness is very difference which is to be expected given it is two different model years with a 4 year difference HOWEVER the new iMac that prior to putting it in the i360 was completely aligned  side by side now since it is inside the i360 it leans to the right. There is a lot of wiggle room in the new i360 whereas the older version has a snugger fit. It still rotates however I have one side propped up to level it out otherwise it the top of the monitor leans into the iMac it is sitting next to.<br /><br />So there ya go. I do not know if it is defective or if there has been major changes in the design however if you have two iMacs and place them side by side both with a i360 they may bump into each other and the gap between them starts out wide at the bottom and overlaps at the top preventing it from rotating unless you move the iMac's a good distance away from each other.

Yeah!!!!!<br /><br />This mouse is very light and feels GREAT in my hand.  I'll give some first thoughts below.<br /><br />Pros:  Lightweight and great feel in the hand; Customization of buttons; Pairing process is super fast and easy; rechargeable battery;<br />Cons:  I haven't found one yet.<br /><br />I have this paired with my laptop and my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Tablet.  Pairing on both was really fast and easy.  One thing I noticed on the tablet (and it's not the fault of the mouse) is that when a mouse it paired with it then I don't seem to get the on screen keyboard to type with.  i'm assuming I'll need to pair by Bluetooth keyboard with it which I haven't done yet.  Once I do that I will update this reviews.<br /><br />One thing that this mouse does, and I didn't think I would use it, is that scroll wheel can be used to control the volume on the PC.  Push the wheel left and you get Volume Down, push right and you get Volume Up.  Of course with the customize utility that comes with it you can make the wheel and buttons do pretty much anything you want.<br /><br />I was hesitant to spend $80 on a mouse, but someone gave me a gift card so I used that toward the purchase.  Would I spend the $80 if I had to?  The answer is yes.  I think I will get another for a backup.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful.",

The touchpad is a BAD knockoff of the apple touchpad from their macbookpro line. The HP/Synaptics touchpad on this model of laptop allows for multi-touch gestures, though scrolling is the only one that seems to work. Despite this multi-touch ability they did not enable two-finger touch to be a right-click. Massive drawback.    The touchpad has the feature that if you push down on the touchpad with pressure, it will physically \\\\\"click\\\\\".  Here is the problem:    Left clicking: A light tap on the touchpad, anywhere, counts as a left click. But a heavy tap that makes the \\\\\"click\\\\\" in the touchpad happen, only works INSIDE of the little drawn rectangles that are the right and left \\\\\"buttons\\\\\".  This is hugely counter-intuitive. You'll be scrolling away down a document and go to left click on something and because you pushed it a hair too hard, and it doesn't count. This becomes infuriating after the 10th time. It has to be lightly, or inside the little drawn on box.  Accidentally drag another finger over the touchpad while you are clicking? NOTHING. no click. Leave a finger of the left \\\\\"button\\\\\" like you would on a normal touchpad with buttons?  NOTHING. no click    Right Clicking: Apple made their multi-touch mouse right click when you touch it with 2 fingers. HP, when deciding to make a knock off of their mouse, left this out. Instead left clicks can ONLY happen inside of the little left button box that is drawn onto the touchpad. Light taps in the box don't work, must be a hard tap so the touchpad \\\\\"clicks\\\\\".  A light tap, even inside of the \\\\\"left button\\\\\" box, is a right click.    The rest of the laptop: Decent. With a core i5 and plenty of ram, this laptop is snappy running Windows 7. The screen is gorgeous. Onboard hdmi, vga, esata, and gigabit nic are all nice features. I'd like more than 3 usb ports, but that's not a deal breaker for me. They integrated the hp quick launch buttons into the F keys, which would be annoying if I used them. I never used them, however, on my previous HP and didn't plan on it for this one, so no big deal.    The laptop isn't exactly light, but it is lighter than the previous model with the same size screen. Overall weight I would rate as good. It has a full keyboard with number pad, which is nice.    Overall: Laptop is good if you don't plan on using the built in touchpad. If you plan on using this touchpad constantly, keep looking. I've used it for 2 weeks now and still haven't gotten used to this strange touchpad.  HP massively missed the mark when coping apple's multi-touch touchpad, and completely fubar'ed it.",

It was very basic, but fit the Kindle perfectly, included strong magnets to keep the cover closed and turn the Kindle on and off, was padded, and looked nice. But I had a picture that was perfect for my Kindle, so I bought this cover.<br /><br />The cheapie cover is nicer than this one in every way except for the custom printing. This one doesn't fit the Kindle well. It doesn't have magnets. The hand-strap prevents the cover from fully closing unless you put the elastic strap around it, and then the front cover bends around the handstrap, which means that the handstrap is putting pressure on the Kindle screen. It's kind of lumpy where the elastic straps are sewn into the cover, and has some odd bulges in the middle of the covers, and the edges aren't straight. Overall, if you were to ask me which cover is the cheapie one and which is the certified one, this one would be my guess as the cheap-o.<br /><br />The custom image is neat. I had to futz around a bit during the ordering process to make sure my picture uploaded correctly and then filled the entire cover. The resulting printed image looks really good. It is very high resolution and sharp. The only problem is that the printing isn't very bright, so the white sections of the image look rather gray, and the colors are dull. It's not bad, but it's not ideal. I would have thought that the printers would have laid down a white background under the image instead of printing the image directly onto the dark cover.<br /><br />Overall, 2 stars for the cover itself, 4 stars for the custom printing.

My knee jerk reaction was that the book couldn't be improved upon, and I sure didn't want to spend more time staring at backlit screens. She showed me how great her screen was, and some of the other features, but it took me a while to warm up to the thought of an electronic book. Much of what I read is off the beaten track, often scholarly books on topics many would find odd.     The Kindle isn't an electronic book. It is a whole library, instantly searchable. Over the past several months I've noticed that many of the books I most want to read are available on the Kindle many of them as free downloads. Our house is overly crowded with books and it can be nearly impossible to find what we want to read or reference because there are just so many titles and my husband and I have very different ideas about how they should be organized...which results in organizational chaos.     The Kindle is a joy to read. It is my new favorite thing. The first one I had arrived with a small mark on the screen. I was reluctant to return it because I didn't want to be parted from it and didn't relish the thought of customer service red-tape. After a few days I made myself call, and couldn't have been more delighted. The polite and friendly person on the other end arranged everything. A shipping voucher arrived by email immediately and I was able to keep reading right up until the new device arrived. Switching my library to the new machine was easy, though I have to refile the books into their proper catagories.    There are some flaws in the system, but I'm confident that any company as helpful and proactive as Amazon will have them resolved. Some issues are up to the publishers, but if anybody can nudge them in the right direction it's Mr. Bezos, my new favorite CEO (Watch his interviews with Charlie Rose, very insightful). Some books are not easy to navigate if one is searching forinformation and jumping around (publisher issue). There is still a little glare on the screen but I'm sure the engineers are working hard to fix it.    Wonderful company, amazing product.",

That having been said, this product has its own fatal flaw, which makes it difficult for me.<br /><br />It's a power hog. When it works, it doesn't seem to have very much reliability or range, at least when powered off of two Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, which provide 1.2 volts of power each. You can work around this in two ways:<br /><br />One is to power it via U.S.B.<br /><br />Granted, the whole point of a wireless keyboard is to have it detached from your computer, either to reduce cable clutter or use it from a distance where a cord would prove inconvenient. You won't have fewer cables this way but the keyboard can be distanced from the computer, if you use a U.S.B. charger of the sort you use for mobile phones and MP3 players. I prefer the ones built into surge protectors, as to not block the outlet for the sake of a relatively low power ac/dc converter. However, one of the sort that comes with every iPod and iPad should work fine regardless<br /><br />[Sidebar: It should be noted that if you do decide to plug it into the computer, you'll still need to have the wireless dongle plugged in for data transmission purposes, so you'd generally be worse off than if you'd bought a wired keyboard to begin with, since you have to block two U.S.B. ports at a time.]<br /><br />The other solution is to use higher voltage batteries.<br /><br />The typical AA battery is the common 1.5 volt disposable Alkaline. This should work fine on occasion but if you plan to use the keyboard frequently, the cost of throwing away your batteries adds up. A rechargable battery type that may work is the relatively uncommon Nickel Zinc chemistry, which provides 1.6 volts on average. I have [[ASIN:B0029NZVZ0 PowerGenix ZR-PGX1HRAA-4B 1 Hour Quick Charger with 4 AA 1.6v NiZn Rechargeable Batteries]] I hear the additional tenth of a volt can be too much for certain sensitive devices, such as camera flashes but for the brief amount of time I used them for the xArmor U9W, they seemed to work fine, albeit still drained rather quickly.<br /><br />I'm assuming anybody who cares about the keyswitches on their keyboard enough to buy this particular product will be using it frequently, so this can be a bit of an additional hidden cost to use the product as intended. It's a fair bit of an inconvenience too, especially since I personally haven't seen NiZN available in any walk-in store.<br /><br />When I bought this keyboard it was the only wireless mechanical keyboard available on the market, given that the Filco Majestouch bluetooth keyboard was out of production. There's currently another option now, the kbTalkingPro, I actually much prefer judging by M.S.R.P. values, not only because it averts this problem but also because it's more featureful. I'll talk about that more on that product's page though.<br /><br />The xArmor remains still noteworthy for a few reasons reasons: One is that it currently has a lower street price that more than makes up for the cost of NiZN batteries, if you don't quite have the capital funds for the kbTalking Pro in your budget. More importantly, it remains the only Wireless U.S.B. option for a mechanical keyboard, if you can't use Bluetooth for some odd reason. There's a wireless mouse combo with this keyboard too, called the U27, although I don't think that's available any longer. It also has brown switches, if that variant of the kbTalking Pro ever happens to sell out.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the power consumption problems makes it difficult for me to rate the xArmor U9W any better than mediocre at best.",

Amateur/Professional photographers who work under less than ideal conditions will find this card to be fast, reliable and offer good performance. I thought about buying one 2GB card but settled on two 1GB cards, because they are actually a little faster (performance wise) than the 2GB card. The other reason is that I didn't want to be in a situation that if that one 2GB failed, I wouldn't have another to pop in the camera and go unless you have the $$$ to buy two 2GB cards. Besides, it was cheaper to get two 1GB cards than buy one 2GB card. I bought two of these 1GB high speed cards to use with my Canon DSLR 30D and am very pleased with them.

I think backshell fit wasn't wide enough. There is a 1mm gap on the left and right sides and around the hinges that could have been sized better. The screen and keyboard films fit really well almost too good as it can be tricky to stick an exact size into place.<br /><br />The graphic - The image is nice, but I'm not easy to please, it could have been a higher resolution. When you get to arms length you can see the blur in the image. Looks like they resized the image from a smaller device to fit my yoga pro 2. From a little further away it's very catching, also to the fit issue with the backshell. On a black laptop this wouldn't be a issue as much as it is with my lenovo orange.<br /><br />The Retap- I love the idea, the ease to install, the physical quality of the film, not liking the backshell fit and disappointed with the image resolution.

There were several other apps I could not use either including FlightTrack Pro, Zappos, and Fandango in addition to several more games.

I had purchased the HD6 to replace my HDX, but given issues with incompatible apps, I am keeping my HDX and returning the HD6.  It is a great size for reading and portable video viewing.  A bit heavy though---certainly when comparing to 7&#34; HDX.  If they get the issues with the App Store resolved, perhaps I will re-purchase in the future.

I put a Samsung 840 EVO 1TB SSD in it, and it works very well, but the Samsung software tools don't recognize the drive as a Samsung drive, because the enclosure remaps things.  I don't mind that it remaps things - I gather that's probably necessary for the UASP feature - but I wish I could switch the UASP on and off so that when I want to, I can easily use the Samsung tools e.g. for drive stats and diagnostics.<br /><br />Back on the positives, this is the only 2.5&#34; external drive enclosure I've ever owned with an on/off switch, and I do love having that feature.<br /><br />In short : looks great, feels great, super lightweight, very easy to open & close without tools yet firmly held together so it won't slide open by accident.

There's a knob on the back of the subwoofer that allows you to adjust the level.  If you're  going to place the sub under a desk (at your feet), you're not going to need much more than one-quarter level to vibrate the room.  The (2) satelite speakers can handle their own at approximately 15 watts each but do sound just a bit flat. What's missing is the mid-range.  Each satelite is 6 inches tall and 3 inches wide on the stand.  The volume cube is nice and allows for a very good range from low to high.  These are great for jazz and something a bit slower but I don't know if I'd like them for rock.  What's equally nice is I'm able to hook these up to my tv (via the headphone jack) and add some nice bass and 2.1 surround for movie-watching.  I do think they can rival the Bose Companion 3's but only because of the price I paid.  I haven't played a game yet, but have no doubt they will do very well with the sound effects.

I end up walking way to make a cup of tea or something when doing a big move anyway because it still takes a few minutes, so it's no different than my USB 2 drive to me.<br /><br />If I had to pick one between this and the M3, I would go with the M3 just because of personal aesthetic preference.

The bottom line is that it is an improvement, but only slightly.  I still have a very LOW connectivity in some of the rooms, and its just hard to understand why.<br />The setup process was very easy using the installation key.  I did have to use customer support as my modem has an internal battery and I didn't know how to completely power it down. BTW, customer service is EXCELLENT. I was through after 3 rings on the first call late Saturday afternoon and John walked me through the process like a pro.

I wasn't sure what to expect as I wasn't able to see it in person ahead of time to get a sense of the visual created by the monitor.  I'm very particular and monitor clarity, sharpness and brightness are important to me for my needs as I'm on the computer ten hours a day most days. I discovered this monitor initially as Dell was offering me a special price on it when I ordered my computer through them.  I looked at the reviews on Amazon and thought it was worth taking a chance.<br /><br />I have been nothing shy of incredibly happy with this purchase. Everything that was important to me is inclusive with this monitor.  The sharpness and clarity are amazing.  The brightness is perfect. It's very bright but at same time very easy on the eyes.  It has a non-glare screen, which I am not usually a fan of as for my taste, the monitors without the non-glare screens always seemed to produce a sharper image, but this monitor has converted me to a non-glare screen fan. I love the non-glare now and I have learned for those who spend a lot of time on the computer, the non-glare helps reduce things like eye strain and headaches. I still would not purchase just any non-glare screened monitor but this one I can confidently recommend.<br /><br />Features:  The monitor can slide up and down on the stand, depending upon the height you prefer and it slides very easily and securely without much effort.  You can rotate the monitor toward you or angle it straight, etc.  It's very easy and smooth to move it toward you or away from you.  It has a nice, 1/2\\\\\" thin bezel which I always think is more apppealing and far less distracting than the wider bezels. The wider bezels also just take up extra space unecessarily to me as it makes the monitor just be bigger for no reason.  I find the 24\\\\\" monitor, in this case, to be the perfect size - not too big and just perfectin terms of viewing screen space. It does not have speakers but that is not a problem for me.  It may be a problem for others or you could just purchase speakers.  I have sound coming out of my Dell computer instead. The quality of the monitor itself is visible and there is nothing cheap looking or cheap feeling about this monitor.  It has the power button on the bottom right of the bezel and has 4 other adjustment buttons above the power button.  I have not tried adjusting the color as I have not needed to do so, so I cannot comment on the customization of that - but I understand it's fairly customizeable.  This monitor is also 1980 x 1200 which is slightly better resolution than most monitors and that extra resolution punch I think does make a different.  I beleive most other monitors are 1980 x 1080 and that extra 120 I think must definitely help stretch the clarity of this great monitor.<br /><br />I see no faults or criticisms to even mention as I am extremely happy with my purchase and would whole heartedly recommend this monitor to others.  I do believe Amazon has dropped the price in the past two weeks as the cost was $369 prior and I believe now it is $269 and at $269 it is a bargain for this quality of a monitor.  It's definitely pricier than most other monitors as you can buy a decent monitor for about $200 but in my opinion the extra money on this monitor is well worth it if you spend a lot of time on the computer like I do, or are particular when it comes to sharpness, brightness and clarity of a monitor. Get it while you can at the $269 price :)<br /><br />Five stars!!",

Magnets keep the cover closed tightly when you're not reading, the corners of the case are just a bit wider than the Kindle itself, and the outside of the case it slightly padded (but not bulky), all of which keep my device well-protected while being toted along in my purse.

Just be careful not to press too hard; take a little more time and work patiently, and you will have an installation nearly free of bubbles. If bubbles occur, you can lift up the protector and redo it. Start at one edge and apply to the tablet screen while holding the other edge off, then slowly lower the screen as you work out the bubbles. Takes 5 minutes or so, and you're done. I'm confident that I can now use the tablet without fear of scratching it. I've used these protectors on my Droid smartphone for years, and they've kept it looking like new. I expect the same here.",

In this case, however, I'm going to write something to try to warn other potential buyers of this product about its gross shortcomings. First, I will mention a couple of mildly positive aspects. The build quality of the machine is quite good, and it is very light. The flip screen seems sturdy enough that it will likely go through a lot of use before having any issues. Those things said, I will turn to the negative. My main gripe about this product is related the functionality of the track pad and the response of the software to track pad inputs. I'm a long-time Mac/OS user, and really believe that Apple has perfected the operation of their track pads. (In case you're wondering, the only reason I purchased this XPS is because my job requires that I often use a program that runs only on windows, and I travel a good bit). I'll spare you an entire novella about the various problems with the Dell trackpad, and will simply summarize them as such: cheap quality and utterly inconsistent responsiveness. The pad works like a Mac sometimes (just a touch, no clicking) and other times not, it is extremely fussy about where exactly you're touching it, i.e. if you're trying to do a highlight/cut/paste, it's nearly impossible to get a consistent response out the machine - one time it accepts the highlighting exactly as intended, and the next three times it highlights half a line, no line at all, or highlights it, then drops it when you try to cut). Just incredibly frustrating. Problem #2 of many - the combination of this awful track pad and windows system forces the user (and I admit I'm not a power user) to go up to the upper left-hand corner of the screen and click in order to move among active programs. Unlike the Mac, the problem with this machine/software is that it's extremely fussy about the movement and speed of the pointer when you're trying to do this action. One time it works, the next time you'll move it and millimeter too far, or just slightly too fast, and it jumps to another screen without warning. And last - Windows 8 is a really awful product, full of junk, advertising, and useless &#34;functionality&#34; designed to get you to buy more microsoft and Dell products.

This machine is not up to IBM standards, and do not expect IBM quality.<br />It is quiet, and has a nice display. However, the most used input device on a notebook PC is the mouse, which in this case is a touch pad. This is the worst touch pad I have ever used!  You will try all the settings and never get it to work correctly.  Just try doing a right click on the background to set display resolution and the background picture. On my Sony Windows 7 notebook this is trivial. On the Lenovo touchpad it is nearly impossible- this thing will not recognize right click! Try to create a short cut on the desk top to your favorite programs- sorry- not possible on this machine!<br />This touch pad does not have true buttons. Instead, it relies on pressing a certain area of the touch pad. I still can not locate where that area is, so good luck with your experiments in trying to get this to work.  It will go back in the box and I will now consider other brands of PC, such as Toshiba. Lenovo has now killed what used to be the BEST notebook brand in the world.<br />I did note that battery life seems to be OK, and the weight is acceptable.  My machine came with a 256 GB solid state hard drive, and this is a nice touch for faster system operation. It should also help the battery last longer, as spinning a hard drive takes a fair amount of energy.<br />The ultimate solution to making this machine useable is to forget about the touch pad interface, and purchase a nice USB / wireless mouse or external touch pad. Now you can use this machine and make some serious progress on all your computer work. It just means when you travel with this PC you must carry along another piece of hardware- a working mouse.",

I just received the nicely packaged product, and was somewhat surprised that it's just two adhesive strips of felt instead of the spacey green polymer suggested by the photo, making the $9.95 price tag a bit steep. But OK. Whatever works. I'm happy to pay for convenience over having to start a crafts project. Totally fair.<br /><br />I applied the strips, and... well... it basically stops the Magic Mouse dead in its tracks when I use it with my mouse pad. (Which I need, because it has a built-in wrist support.) The description says that Fliders will let you use your Magic Mouse WITHOUT a mouse pad, though it's not clear that it makes the mouse useless WITH one. So I tried using the mouse without the pad. It so happens that my desk is covered with a type of linoleum cutting matte surface (and an actual self-healing cutting matte). On both surfaces the Fliders make it significantly more difficult to move the Magic Mouse.<br /><br />Luckily, the Fliders came off fairly easily, with some peeling and scraping and futzing, and did not damage the plastic. Maybe this product works if you're using your Magic Mouse on a glass desk, or a polished wood. I don't know. But please be aware that this product will make your mouse basically useless if you're using it WITH a mouse pad, or on plastic surfaces.",

It was just the mouse itself wrapped 4 times over in bubble wrap and put into a bubble wrap bag.<br />Delivery Time: Expect it to take a while because it will be shipped from China. The package was delivered 3 days early. :)<br />Product: I received the product today and I plugged it in an it works fine. The mouse DOES change colors with that top button (so you can't change DPI's from the mouse itself); red, blue, and purple(saying that lightly). The preview images, as you can imagine, are more saturated than the real thing. Red looks like the picture only a little lighter; good for me because it's my favorite color. Blue looks the best (even distribution of color); MUCH lighter than the picture though. Purple(?) looks NOTHING like the picture; It look like they made purple by turning on both blue and red LED's (purplish in some regions and blue in others). The mouse feels plastic and light (cheap) but looks super cool. I didn't expect the cord to be so short; probably like 4.5 to 5 feet. The cord feels cheap and durable at the same time; feels like the surface of a vinyl record. the cord's connection to the mouse feels kinda loose and I think it'll be the first thing to go. Overall, I am satisfied but I don't expect this product to last more than a year or 2. I don't play League of legends but if I did I wouldn't expect this mouse to last more than a year. Good thing I bought it with a gift card :). Need a cheap gaming mouse to get you by (1.5 months after purchase)? This is the product for you.<br /><br />EDIT: After playing KOTOR 2 for about 5 hours with this mouse: It's very comfortable. Another reviewer said it was made for people with large hands and I have large hands and found it to be a little on the small side (same size as my old logitech mouse) but still comfortable. The black parts of the mouse create ridges/bumps that you can feel, like the black is higher than the white/opaque-transparent(that the color comes through) parts. The top is very smooth and the side have a rough texture. The sides feel cheaper than the rest. Also, a very light mouse as you can imagine.<br /><br />I'm no expert on mice, I just wanted to make a review that paints a picture of the product.

You have to spread out your hand to use the features:  right click etc. Pushing both right and left buttons to get a make believe scroll almost requires 2 hands. I'm a pianist and can stretch my hands, but this is awkward very awkward and time consuming.  If you drop it and you're on a hard floor, the ball pops out and you are dealing with a ball.  Good luck finding it.  It rolls, under furniture, tables, etc. I have given this the old college try and it's no good for someone who is a heavy computer user. I had no idea that a mouse could be sold that does not have a scroll feature.  I have gone to the website and downloaded whatever is available for this mouse but the download did absolutely nothing.That was valueless. I find no additional features to using this mouse from the download so I wonder what was the purpose for the download. I'm going to delete whatever was inserted into my computer.

Microsoft needs to stop coming up with these stupid \\\\\"new and improved\\\\\" ideas and forcing them on the consumer.  At the very least, give choices instead of making it ridiculously hard to find older versions that are better.  One thing that drives me nuts is when on the internet, a screen keeps popping up about \\\\\"only show secure content\\\\\".  I continually hit \\\\\"ok to show content\\\\\" on the same site and it keeps popping up.  Seems on older versions, this would no longer pop up.  If I have to go through more steps to make it stop, then MS took a step backwards.<br /><br />The other things (more hardware related) that I don't like:<br /><br />1. The touchpad is too touchy.  It keeps changing the size of the screen (enlarging and shrinking), even when you are trying to stop it from shrinking or enlarging.  It happens consistently which is really annoying.<br />2. The screen I am typing on will keep changing to another screen and I have to go back and find the original page.  Heck, it just happened again while typing this review.<br />3. I also don't find this laptop to be any quicker than my older one which as less memory.  I expected to see a difference.<br /><br />I'm sure there are some positive things about this computer but between Windows8 having a \\\\\"too busy\\\\\" look to it and the distraction of the screen changing sizes, I can't come up with anything.",

I remember researching it before I purchased and there were some buyers who speculated about the Arm-based processor. To be honest, the processor is very snappy, and I have yet to see the device boggled down, even with 10 browsing tabs open. I have been told Google had yet to unlock the potential of the Samsung Arm-based processor and as time goes on Google is working on building software to utilize the capability. Perhaps this is why the processor is so snappy at this time, because there has been a considerable amount of time for proper drivers to be designed.The build quality feels great, and it's easy to tell the chromebook was designed to combat minor bumps or knock overs. However, because the casing is plastic I bought an iPearl shell (which was quite affordable) to prevent scratches. The screen quality is average, not mind-blowingly great, but good enough where it never bothered me. I am familiar with all the current operating systems (Mac, Linux, Windows, Chrome) and would have to say I never feel limited in the Chrome OS. I had a windows netbook a couple years back and used it for essentially the same thing (browsing, movies, flash games, online banking, instant messaging). I never used the netbook for intense games or graphic design because it was running an intel atom processor. Although I liked my netbook, it lacked the speed, security, stability, battery life, low price, seamless updates, virus vulnerability, and solid feel/finish that the Samsung Chromebook has. Thank you for making such a great machine Samsung, and thank you for making a such an excellent OS Google! I highly recommend this chromebook for anyone looking in it's price range ($200-$250)",

Options in the software are helpful and work as expected, which is something I could never say for Creative.<br /><br />The bass is so much better especially... it makes me want to move out of an apartment and into a house just so I can go full blast on my music and games.",

So I sent it back and I got the replacement. This is a good one but istead of disconnection every 5 mins it does every half to 2 hrs. my wife works from home sometimes and she has to be online the whole day, but due to this disconnecting problem she has to log in every time she disconnects. My brother who is also a network engineer has told me not to buy any D-Link products these days because of this issues. I have now ordered Cisco Router. I am thankful for the prompt service from Amazon and its vender who replace my first router quickly. Again please don't buy this router. Also the tech and replacement policy from D-Link is bad.",

In a word...there's NO COMPARISON. (Okay...that's two words.) The Klipsch 2.1's blew away all the other 2.1 systems. Granted, the ProMedia's cost about 3 times as much, but still...You FEEL the music with these speakers, even at low volumes (which, in its own way, is even a better test of a speaker system than blasting them til your ears bleed.) No other system I tried resulted in the ability to feel the music like the ProMedia 2.1's.<br /><br />A while back I made a USB flash drive with all of my favorite songs to play in my car -- over 1,200 songs, covering all different genres. So to give these new speakers a real world workout I plugged that USB drive into my laptop, loaded everything into WMP, hooked up the ProMedia 2.1's, and after the first few tunes I was in heaven. I hadn't heard so much out of these tunes since my old Atlantic Technology 3 piece system died. The bass took on a life of its own, as did the highs, mids, and sound stage.<br /><br />I can't speak to the durability problems since I just got the speakers at Best Buy yesterday. But judging only by the sound, they are amazing, especially for the price. Would I prefer an on/off switch? Yes. Am I a bit concerned about the problems cited with the DIN plug? Yes. Do those issues offset the sound coming out of this system? Not at the present time. But I'll certainly update this review if/when the DIN problem arises. For now, I'm just enjoying music in a way that I can only describe as thrilling. And I haven't had that experience in quite some time. Listening to the ProMedia 2.1's showed me, almost instantly, just how much I'd been missing.",

I would not recommend it as the only mouse option because the finger band isn't comfortable for hours of use and it gets in the way if I want to do serious typing on the keyboard. The Amazon picture shows it being used on the index finger but I found that awkward. The picture on the package showed it on the middle finger with the index finger going across the top of the unit and the thumb pressing the buttons and scrolling. This made it much more stable and easier to control. It also helps with typing since the index fingers type more than the middle fingers. Rotating it more toward the thumb was also helpful. I have a wireless mouse that I use when working at a desk, I can seamlessly switch between the two without unplugging either or making any changes to the settings.

Perfect for my not quite sun up morning walks. I do like the origami case, it is kind of fun to play with. I don't typically stand my Kindle up on its own, but I did try it both vertically and horizontally without difficulty. I also like how secure the Kindle is within the case.

The stitching is tight, neat and secure. It fits the Kindle securely and matches the screen just right. There is a tiny bit of room around the edges of the screen. This is important since some of the functions of the Kindle require tapping or touching at the edge of the screen and you don't want the leather creating distance or changing the way you touch/interact with the screen. The back of the cover has a well stitched leather strap or slit attached to sturdy elastic. This allows you to slip between 1 to 4 fingers through the back with either hand so that the Kindle is suspended from your hand and doesn't require you to clutch the Kindle between thumb and fingers. It sounds silly as I write this but I often read for 4-6 hours straight on the weekend and little muscles begin to quiver and shake from trying to manipulate and hold the Kindle. This back-slit is way more important than it may sound (the first time a friend showed me theirs I thought, yeah you bought a cheap marketing ploy - I was wrong). The case is lightly padded and I feel safe putting my Kindle in a satchel or briefcase. The case comes with a matching black elastic band that can strap the case closed or be bound over the back of the Kindle, out of the way. My only concern - and I have no evidence either way - would be, how long will the elastic on the back-slit and the elastic strap that closes the unit last before it is loose or begins to unravel. Again, this isn't a design criticism, it's just something I don't know because I've only had the case a few months. All in all, I'm very happy with this case. It's elegant, high quality and functional. I recommend it highly. UPDATE: 1.5 years in, the case is still in great shape, the elastic is still strong. Initial impression stands.",

As for the tablet itself, it is a major hassle to use, but once you get it functioning, it is fine.  If you copy files from your pc to your tablets appropriate folders, it does not reccognize them.  The computer registers the files as being there on the tablet, but when you try to find them on your tablet, there is nothing on the screen.  It was an awful frustrating time trying to transfer my books to the tablet and I am still struggling with that a couple weeks after the purchase.  Maybe mine is just bad or something-it did appear damaged so I don't rule out the possibility.  I also think the processor is kind of crappy.  It takes forever to load applications, like the Kindle reading app for instance.  It also locks up sometimes.  As for positive things about the tablet, once you finally do get it working, it fuctions well as a reader.  I have tried some simple gaming applications with no trouble as well.  My overall review is that you get what you pay for.  If you want a cheap tablet, you get a cheap tablet.  If you buy this tablet, don't be expecting it to be like a Kindle-its not.  However, if you can figure out how to transfer the books, its a great little device; fun for road trips or a quiet pass-time.  Had I recieved mine in the new condition described, I would have given it a 4 star rating.  If it were in new condition AND I could get my books onto it, I would give it a 5 star rating.  As I received mine, cracked and possibly defective, I rate a 3.  It functions but its incredibly aggravating.",

I personally like my mouse to always be visible on screen, even when typing, and I adjust the settings for quick movement, and the only problem I've ever experienced is that when I was using the mouse on my recliner, it would occasionally roam--but that could easily be due to either the microsuede material (certainly not an intended surface!) or the fact that the recliner is also a rocker, so it's less stationary than a desk.<br /><br />In short, I'm sorry to hear that others have had issues, but for me, this is the best mouse I've used and I absolutely would recommend it.",

Even the 32GB of G.Skill memory runs cool. If you need more USB ports or and external fire wire connection, ASUS provides cards...but you use up an expansion slot.<br /><br />In short, this board is all you'll need.

            "input": "I have had the Kindle Keyboard and the lighted case for that device for a year now and I've been very impressed with the quality of that case.  I just recently purchased the new Kindle and the new lighted case.  What a let-down!  This new case is a major step backwards in terms of quality and engineering.    First off, let's go through the positives of this case:  1.)  The light is now centered over the Kindle, which provides more even lighting than the Kindle Keyboard case.    2.)  The rubberized housing in the case has sufficient grip to allow me to feel that my Kindle is being held securely.  That's about it for the positives.  Now for the negatives:  1.)  The light is very flimsy.  The hinge on the swing-out light is loose and the plastic is so thin and light-weight that one decent snag on a sweater or bag will probably break the light right off of the case.  2.)  The front cover of the case is far too flexible, providing just above zero protection for the fragile e-ink screen.  It wouldn't take much pressure on the front cover to crack the Kindle's screen underneath.  3.)  The leather on the front and back of the case has no texture to speak of, so the case is slick in the hands and it scratches easily.  Within 30 minutes of receiving my case, I already had a scratch on the front cover and that came from simply putting the Kindle down on my desk and sliding it a few inches.  4.)  The rubberized housing which holds the Kindle in place does it's job a little too well, making it difficult to actually press the back and forward page turn buttons on both sides of the device.  With the Kindle out of the case, pressing either the back or forward buttons with minimal force gives a satisfying \\\\\"click\\\\\".  With the Kindle in the case, you have to exert much more force on the buttons to get them to register and the \\\\\"click\\\\\" is gone, making it more difficult to determine if you've actually pressed the button or not.  I spent about 20 minutes with an Xacto knife and a file to remove a good chunk of the rubber and plastic housing in order to allow me to press the buttons easily again.  5.)  There is no method for keeping the cover closed.  The Kindle Keyboard cover has a nice elastic band that keeps the cover closed, even when you're tossing it in a book bag.  There is nothing on this new cover.  So the cover can and will fly open if you aren't careful with it.  All in all, this is a poorly designed case that apparently was not even tested before being shipped out.  I could forgive the flimsy cover and cheap leather, but having the rubber conflict with the page turn buttons is unacceptable.  I shouldn't have to resort to cutting and filing the plastic and rubber in order to fix a problem that should have been caught on the first day of quality control.  The fact that Amazon is charging $60 for a cheaply-made cover that provides almost no protection is completely outrageous.  This case would be overpriced at $20.",

I wanted to try something new and have an enhanced typing experience.<br /><br />This keyboard have a very attractive appearance, in my opinion. It's rather large and all the keys are generously spaced. All of the &#34;extra&#34; functional keys around the outside of the keyboard work well and can be assigned to do any task through the software that Logitech provides. The wrist/palm rest is big bonus. This isn't your typical hard plastic palm rest. It's actually padded with a faux leather type feel to it. Very nice touch, Logitech. All in all, I'm giving it an A for appearance.<br /><br />Now lets talk functionality and typing experience. The wave ergonomic form of the keys allow your fingers to lay very comfortably on the home row. Originally I thought that I would have to get accustomed to the curve of the keys but that is not so. I plugged it in and was able to type on it no problem. In fact my typing speed increased quite a bit from my original keyboard (Logitech K360). I used to average around 72 WPM. On this keyboard, I average around 84 WPM, a significant bump in my opinion. There are two negative remark that I have to make about the typing experience. The first being the wave shape towards the middle of the keyboard. The wave shape rises right in the middle where the T U keys are. This makes your hand stretch just a little to reach them which is unusual to me. Another minor complaint is the feel of the keys. They're a little &#34;mushy&#34;. The light action of the keystroke makes up for the mushiness but it's just something to note. I think Logitech did this to make it more of a silent keyboard because in the noise sector, this keyboard is SUPER quiet. Overall, the typing experience is an A-.<br /><br />The addition of the mouse to this package is what really makes this worth your money. The mouse is awesome. It's a little heavy with both batteries in (but it actually works with one if you prefer the lighter weight). Besides that, the Logitech laser technology is extremely accurate and the mouse sits very comfortably in the hand. There are three button on the left side (forward, backward, and a programmable button). The &#34;infinite&#34; scrolling is also a useful addition. It allows you to scroll through documents or web sites very quickly and you can stop it at any point.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great package and worth every cent.",

The pad surface allows you to fully unlock the potential of a premium gaming mouse.  The Speed side is incredibly smooth, and my mouse just glides.  The control side it a little more course, so you are more aware of the mouse movement on the pad.  I can't tell any difference in pointer tracking on either side, but each side definately offers a distict tactile feel.  Both sides are equally functional, so which side you use depends on your own preference.    On a side note, I have a Logitech wireless MX600 that will not track on this pad, but works great on any other surface.  I think you may need a premium gaming laser to accurately track on this pad.

No problems transferring jpg images and videos from either camera to a Motorola Droid running Android 2.2.3. or uploading to Flickr. You can pick and choose in camera or set the card to upload everything. If you're transferring photos to a mobile device rather than a home computer, I would not advise transferring everything automatically; battery life in the mobile device will suffer.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just returned from a 2400-mile round-trip train trip from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon and back. I used the Coolpix P7100 and the 8GB Mobile X2 card to shoot photos and video from the train and on hikes in the Portland area, transferring photos wirelessly to my Droid phone. I did have a couple of times near the end of the return leg of the trip where the camera said the card could not be used. This occurred twice when I powered up the camera and once trying to review already taken photos. All the photos and videos I took did record just fine. I don't know if this was an issue with the camera or the card, but removing and reinserting the card fixed the problem. A minor annoyance, but worth mentioning. Also, the cards are not the fastest I've used. There was a bit of lag sometimes where I'd have to wait for a photo to write to the card before I could shoot again.",

Fast transfer speeds. Large capacity. Great price ~$28.<br /><br />Cons: The cap doesn't clip and so you'll lose it, but I really don't care. It gets hot, but that's because so much information is streaming through every second. If you fill it up in one transfer, like I did, you'll be surprised at how hot it gets.

The Abit motherboard is just as old running a Pentium 4 at 3.0 GHz with 2 Gbytes of PC3200 RAM on a Windows XP platform with DirectX 9.0c. The old graphics card is an ATI Radeon 9600 with 256 MB DDR. When playing \\\\\"Crisis\\\\\" in developer's mode (devmode), graphics were poor with lots of lag time, jitters, and an average frame rate of 6 to 8 frames per second (fps).     Installation was straight forward. Uninstall the old graphics drivers first before removing the old card and replacing it with the new card. I used the ATI Catalyst uninstaller utility since I had old ATI drivers. Even before this, I downloaded the latest graphics drivers from Visiontek, e.g. ATI 8.11n for AGP. For some reason, these drivers would not recognize the new graphics card. I ended up using the drivers on the included installation disc that were slightly older, but it worked.     What a difference!!! Details, textures, shadows all came alive. Motion was smooth. Framerate was kicked up to about 24 fps on average for \\\\\"Crisis\\\\\" in 1280 x 800 resolution. My son is happy.     2009 will probably be the last year that graphic vendors will offer AGP cards as it is old technology and is already getting harder to find. PCI-e is the new standard. I consider the Visiontek Radeon 3850 512MB GDDR3 AGP card to be top of the line for the AGP slot as there are no other higher line than this. If you cannot wait another year to upgrade your entire hardware system with Windows 7 (Vista is not an alternative for me), and you have an older system with an AGP graphics slot, then seriously consider the Visiontek ATI Radeon 3850 512MB GDDR3 for AGP.",

I still AM.<br />However, my new 3G Paperwhite is a little disappointing.<br /><br />1) I can't find a place to plug in my earphones to listen to audio books.<br /><br />2) My newspaper subscriptions (like WSJ) look for a wireless source first. If one can't be found, the Kindle announces that fact and quits trying. Doesn't want to look for 3G. On a cruise ship at sea, my Kindle Touch always found the shipboard 3G source automatically, and had the news waiting for me when I went to breakfast. NO such luxury with my 3G Paperwhite.<br /><br />3) It's only antidotal, but I've not noticed any increase in battery duration.<br /><br />Of course, the rest of the wonderfulness expounded-upon by other viewers is TRUE!",

This cord has your regular cheap low grade cable insulation (not a nice flexible silicone or anything). Will have to make something to keep the cable elevate to help alleviate the dragging feeling.

My budget was VERY tight..(350$ Total MAX everything included tax also)  NO refurbs unless they came with alike NEW warranty  No used  2. I needed it to do basic tasks while being able to handle Light gaming (World of warcraft,Diablo 3,SC2,Steam games) and still have a respectable battery life  3. I wanted the build quality to also not TOTALLY suck even though it is an extreme budget class.  Tall order for a 350$ budget right?  This laptop accomplished that on 299$  Purchased from bestbuy  Let me start by saying this will be a fairly short review (Though i will add additional information upon request if someone wants to know something specific)    Full Specifications:  CPU: AMD E 450 APU 1.65 Ghz Dual core  GPU: ATI 6320 Intergrated into the APU  HD: 5400 RPM HD 320GB  Ram: 4 GB DDR3  Display: widescreen LED (1366 x 768) 15.6  OS: Windows 7 64 bit Premium  Wireless B+G+N  Fingerprint Reader  Port Locker  4 USB slots  HDMI OUT  Webcamera 0.3 MP  Product Height 1.3\\\\\"  Product Width 14.9\\\\\"  Product Weight 5.2 lbs.  Product Depth 9.9\\\\\"  Keyboard Full size Chiclet with Number pad  6 in1 media reader slot    Performance: Thus far i have play tested Diablo 3 And world of warcraft with the following results  World of Warcraft using Lowest settings and the default Resolution Provides a consistent 30-45 FPS in a large scale Battleground enviorment (Settings can be turned slightly higher in 5 mans or questing solo)  Diablo 3 Is quite playable at 20-30 FPS on lowest settings i was very surprised this game was playable at ALL on this machine let alone respectably playable at that  HD movie playback 720P is without issues on Netflix  Multitasking is ok as long as you don't get TOO unreal once i had Pandora WoW Chrome with 4 tabs open you could notice slowdown not apparent in better CPU's.  The machine sadly howevercomes with TONS of bloatware you either need to uninstall or do a fresh reformat to get the max performance out of this machine    Build Quality  The keyboard is great with almost zero flex unless pushed very hard, palm rest area is equally strong..My biggest concern is the plastic behind the LCD is VERY weak and can be flexed VERY easily...I can produce no screen ripple pushing upon it..however it is a worry if the laptop sits inside a bag for long periods traveling and gets bumped around a ton.  Also the DVD drive is a bit worrysome as it shoots out much like a bullet and the tray is very stiff..not smooth at all.  The biggest annoyance is the USB/Power cord slot...they are the stiffest i have EVER encountered...i thought i was going to have to buy a mallet to work a USB mouse into any of the ports...it's insane you REALLY need to push to get anything in them..The power cord is also slightly stiff but not as bad.  The Screen is what it is..it has apparent light leakage to be expected for a budget machine but is largely not noticable when gaming or video watching..it's Plenty bright even on LOW which is fantastic for battery savings.    Battery  Thus far the only test i have run was playing World of Warcraft on LOW brightness but HIgh performance the laptop lasted 3 Hours 22 Minutes before shutting down.  I will add further Battery tests as i go through them myself with time.    Heat  Heat on this machine is fairly non existant even when gaming under load their is a tiny bit of warmth on the left Palm rest side when under heavy load but nothing of major concern.    Ultimately i went with lenovo as when you are dealing with this price range you are dealing with cheap build quality across the board and compared to similar brands/specs this was the best built of the bargains and Lenovo has a great reputation",

The F1-F12 can also be used to change settings such as muting, play/pause, sleep mode, etc. Additionally, you can switch the back-light to one of seven different colors, but I think the red looks the best due to the color scheme.<br /><br />I don't think the description really highlighted this well, but the six red keys on the left allow you to create macro commands, and it is very easy to do. As of right now, mine are set to open specific menus and purchase items for a multiplayer game I play (DotA 2 anyone?), and I find it extremely useful. The mouse also works pretty well. There are two buttons wear your thumb rest, which are relatively easy to click without lifting your thumb.<br /><br />All and all, I am pretty satisfied with this purchase.",

The bad things about the camera: documentation was poor, I got the zoom feature to only work with MJPEG in windows Explorer (but it works well), the night vision is useless (shows a black screen), the MPEG4 was difficult to make work and didn't self install like the manual said.  The record GUI had problems installing but once I self installed MPEG4 it worked like a champ.    Overall this camera has been stable and is probably the best on the market.  If you run into a problem go online to Pano web site.  They have updates MPEG4 installs etc.  Once the pain of installation was done I'm really happy.",

It has some more subtle perks too though. The USB chord wraps up into the bottom and can be wrapped such that chord come out either side (another thing my last one got an F on). Also, my computer's headphone jack is in the front, and I like sitting in a way that causes the plug to bend and press into my stomach. But, because this cooling pad has such good grip, I can scoot the laptop back so that the front edge of the cooling pad acts as a sort of barrier. An odd pro, yes, but just another thing I love so far about this.   Oh and I guess it cools pretty well too. haha. But really it does. As others have said, the fan is a bit weak, so my computer still gets a little warm. The Antec did cool a little better. And the parts that are warm are in the front where the fan isn't located (by the logitech symbol).

It was even able to play L4D2 at low settings very smoothly.  I was using it all day at work without plugging it in and still had charge to spare.  The multitouch on the trackpad was nice (not perfect, but usable). If this thing was issue free, I'd keep it and give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately there are several issues which seem to plague many of these laptops.  Some people seem to get non defective ones, but judging by the amount of returns and comments online, there is a large percentage of these things failing.      The issues mine was having (which led to me returning it) where as follows:  1.  The trackpad would become unresponsive after a few hours of use and require a reboot to fix.  2.  The battery stopped charging to 100% and would charge all day and only get to slightly above 80%  3.  The computer would randomly shut off without warning and act as if the battery was dead even though it still had plenty of charge.  4.  The computer would frequently not wake from hibernation and would require a full boot.    Problems 2 and 3 may have been a defective battery.  Problem 4 may have been related to the defective battery or an issue that could be fixed with a bios update.  Issue 1 was poor design or incompetent fabrication.  If you search around the web, you can find fixes for problem 1 that involve removing a sticky shim from under the trackpad.  This indeed fixes the problem.

I did run into a few problems that I will let the company know about and hopefully they can help others avoid.  First of all, double check whether you have an IDE drive or a SATA drive before you order (if you don't understand these terms, this may not be for you).  Once you're sure you have a SATA drive (this review is for the SATA drive kit), I'll feel better.<br /><br />If you are currently running Vista and you are planning on cloning your existing drive, there are a couple of preparatory things you should do.  For one, you should download the Vista Recovery DVD.  I used the one located here: [...]Also, when I went through the install, I decided to do the \\\\\"typical\\\\\" install, but afterward, I regretted it.  I bought a 320G hard drive, but I only have 280G available.  This is partially because my original HP hard drive had a 10G partition for recovery.  It's also partially because when the typical install occurred, it expanded the recovery partition to 16G for some reason.  It looks like I may have lost additional gigabytes elsewhere- I don't know for sure, but if I were you, I would customize the install and make sure that the partitions are the size you desire.<br /><br />To download, you do have to use BitTorrent (download and install) and after you download the Vista Recovery DVD, you will have to burn the ISO to a DVD.  If you don't understand a word I'm saying, turn back now- go to the Geek Squad instead.  I was not that excited about using software downloaded via BitTorrent from a site I am not familiar with, but it turned out that it really needed to be done.<br /><br />Most of the process worked the way it's described at the Apricorn web site.  I connected the cable to my new drive, I plugged that in to the USB port (USB 2.0 is preferred, of course).  I then loaded the CD, ran the software and chose to run EZ Gig III.  It did recognize the new drive, the old drive and it let me select the source and destination drives.  The cloning process went smoothly.  I ran into a problem when I installed the new drive.  Instead of booting up directly into Windows, I got an error:<br /><br />\\windows\\system32\\winload.exe<br />Info: The selected entry could not be loaded...<br /><br />After searching around google, I discovered that this problem could be fixed by using the Vista Recovery DVD at neosmart.  So, I downloaded that, burned it onto a DVD.  I then put the DVD in the drive and started the computer.  This time when the computer started, it began to load files from the VRD.  It looked like it was trying to install Windows, but eventually I got to a screen that had a menu option \\\\\"Repair computer.\\\\\"  I chose this option, it detected a problem and gave me the option of fixing it.  I chose to fix the problem.  The computer rebooted, I ejected the DVD and the laptop came up in Windows as I had hoped.  It was a bit more effort than expected, but if you're prepared, you'll have less angst than I did.

I currently have two of these drives, both maxed out at 4GB a piece, one handling the system paging file and the other handling various memory intensive applications. Now some people are going to look at this thing and instantly say \\\\\"Eww, only sata 1?\\\\\" Well given the speed at which you are able to access random data and the total capacity of the drive, sata 1 is all you need. Unless you are filling and emptying the entire contents of the drive repeatedly you don't need a faster connection.<br /><br />Now I see there has been a lot of talk about how this thing is bulky and takes up two PCI slots. INCORRECT. Yes, it is bulky, but I easily placed both of the drives I have in consecutive slots without issue. All you need to do is ensure that the solder points on one card don't touch the other. For this I used a couple layers of electrical tape, and vwala, two cards occupying two slots. Above them I have my graphics card occupying it's slot and that's another tight fitting beast, but so far I've had no heating problems or memory issues and the drives have been in operation for a few months now.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about is the predictable subject, storage space. 4GB a piece is not a lot. However this is one of the only Ram Drives I have even seen. Acard makes a couple of models but they are still unreasonably expensive. As for standard SSD's, why would I want to by a flash based SSD when I'd just have to replace it in a few years when memory clusters start to fail? If you're looking for a quick, easy solution to speeding up access times and don't mind limited storage space, this is the drive for you. If you want something bigger and faster and more expensive, go look up what Acard has to offer. Just don't fall into the flash SSD trap.<br /><br />Update: 01/07/2013<br />Do not expose toheat! Being one of the many people hit by Sandy, I lost power for about two weeks, needless to say the batteries in the ram drives dies within hours. This isn't a complain, just a simple fact. What is alarming though is that when my power was restored, damage to the wiring in the cellar pegged my thermostat at 90* and for two days my apartment was a sauna. During this time the drive batteries recharge and then proceeded to engage in a rapid, uncontrolled disassembly. Luckily no damage was caused to the drives or the computer as the battery contents exploded away from the more sensitive components. Needless to say though, as with all lithium technology except lithium iron phosphate, heat is very dangerous. I'm also now on the hunt for replacement batteries.",

It has quad core GPU Mali 400 which I wish it was something else since its not that good and lots of games aren't optimized for it.<br /><br />- the tablet is very fast and screen display is clear/crispy than my old iPad mini 2012. The battery<br />Life is really good. I would say around 8-9 hrs we browsing with 1/4 brightness. 5-6 hrs of heavy gaming which is really good and it doesn't heat up fast like others tablets i had so far. The build quality is superb! Its really well nice design. Its really thin and really buff like how I say it......fell like a premium tablet like apple products lol. Even my older brother who had an iPad air say the tablet is really well built and design considering it only cost me $129.99 with fast free shipping.<br /><br />- Gaming## I try modern combat 3-4, dead trigger 1-2, Asphalt 7-8, real racing 3, Blitz brigade, shadowgun dead zone, unjustic god among us, GTA vice city, gangstar las Vegas, subway surfer, temple run 1-2, dispicable me minions etc......and I could say that all those games run fine on the tablet. As you know, Mali 400 are not that good with heavy 3d games so the graphic might be off and laggy. If the tablet were to have sgx540+, its would be a really good gaming tablet coupe with a fast RK3188.<br /><br />- the internet on this tablet is good. It haven't loss signal or anything. The web browser is fast, load pages quickly. The speaker is what make this tablet different from others. Its on the bottom front of the tablet instead on the back.

Yes, it's plug $ play, but if you have a 64-bit system (what gamer doesn't these days?) they aren't 'officially' supported.<br /><br />It's no problem though. Just plug them into a USB port, make sure the blu light turns on. Windows 7 64-bit will recognize them as Speakers rather than a headset. Go to Devices and Printers, it'll be listed at the bottom as 'USB Composite Device\\\\\". R-click and select Sound Settings. You'll now get a list of all your audio outputs. In my case, there's Speakers//Realtek High Definition Audio (the ones I have connected to the green audio jack in the back), Realtek Digital Output (the optical audio port I have nothing hooked up to), and Speakers//USB Audio Device (This is your new toy!)<br /><br />Select that third one, and set it to default, now everything will come through the headset (there might be a few games you'll have to set it in the in-game audio options for. I did with Amnesia). One last step, hit Properties with the headset selected, then go to the Enhancements tab, and make sure you check Virtual Surround. That's the way you get it to work with the surround sound. You can turn on the Bass Boost if you like, but DON'T touch Room Correction. The OS thinks these are speakers, remember, but you don't want to calibrate them as speakers. I'd not touch Loudness Equalization, either, but that's just me.<br /><br />That's it.

Of course this is an impossible task as the MBP hardware is so integrated with the Apple operating system. But within the context of what was possible, there's no doubt what the designers were trying to do.  As somebody who has owned several dozen PCs (through my company) and has owned four Macs, I believe they have succeeded.  I'm thrilled with it and recommend it to others. Of course I haven't used it for a long time and that will be the ultimate test.  But I did know before buying it that my nephew has been banging around with his 17 inch HP for quite awhile and it still works fine.<br /><br />Before I do that I'd like to address the issues of service and the issue of the expensive additional hardware for changing a disc drive or adding a new one brought up by Eric O.  I would never have thought to do this without reading his review, but within a minute or two I went to the HP site where I downloaded their parts guide.  It clearly states that this part isn't provided and gives a part number.  I put the number into Google and found numerous places that sell it for $65.  That price is nuts and obnoxious but at the same time they could have made more money by supplying it and adding ten dollars to each computer.  I would guess that less than 10% of their users will take advantage of this.  But I'm not going to defend the $65-- that's nasty and bad business--but Eric O. should know that he at least got a free $65 for not reading the online manuals and going through all of his stress and wasted time.  And as I want to talk about the MacBook Pro, can you put a second drive in it at any price?<br /><br />As far as service goes, I spent many hours investigating the service on every computer I was considering.  The comments on them were all horrible from every brand.  So I then looked at things like the nerds at Best Buy, etc. and the sheer fury that people had about them burned my fingers at my keyboard.  Eventually this led me to a company called SquareTrade.  Again, I spent a lot of time looking at many dozens of people who loved everything about this company.  I found one negative response--from a guy who wanted to get more from SquareTrade than they offer in their contracts.  I called them and was impressed and ended up buying a plan for my iPad. I don't have anything to do with SquareTrade, but they were great on two phone calls and followed up with my email confirmation with a phone call and a letter about my iPad contract.<br /><br />I have 90 days before I have to buy a Warranty on the Envy.  The SquareTrade plan is $200 for three years.  As I was buying my Envy from J&R Music world which was selling it for $100 less than the HP website or anyplace listed on Amazon at that time (it's up now) that meant I could get three years of service for an additional $100.<br /><br />On to the MacBook Pro comparison:<br /><br />Price - The MBP costs $1100 more than what I paid for my Envy<br /><br />Keyboard and design - As everybody says, HP has stolen the look and the backlit keyboard. But there is a keypad and more keys in general.  I'm not crazy about the arrow buttons and I keep hitting the num lock button because it's next to the backstage button.  But for my usage - score the keyboard as a win for the Envy as it has more stuff.<br /><br />The MacBook Pro wins on the TrackPad, weight and I suspect overall strength and durability.  The processor speed is 2.4 i7 and on the Envy it is only a 2.2. It has Thunderbolt, which is awesome.  Does it have a better screen?  I love the Envy screen and I don't care.<br /><br />RAM - The Envy has 8GB vs 4GB MBP<br /><br />DVD - The Envy comes with Blu-ray and the MBP doesn't.<br /><br />The Envy hard drive is 750 GB 7200 rp  vs 750 GB 5400 rpm drive (ugh!) on the MBP.  $50 extra for 7200 rpm.  There is no excuse in 2012 to have a 5400 drive not standard on a top-of-the line laptop. Displays - You can connect three displays to the Envy and two to the MBP.<br /><br />Do you get more speed from a processor that's .2 better or from double the RAM and a 7200 rpm drive? My experience is no.<br /><br />Ports - The Envy has 3 fast ports (USB 3.0) and one normal (USB).  The MBP has one fast port (Firewire 800) and three normal speed ports (USB 2.0)  But it has Thunderbolt which puts the MBP in an entirely different dimension if you are a pro editor, musician, etc.  If you need that, then get the MBP.  On the other hand, firewire 800 ports have already begun to be phased out by some music hardware companies that had them before. Apple doesn't include their firewire 400 connections now.  Maybe in the future they will go all Thunderbolt to make you buy more stuff from them.<br /><br />Graphics - Everybody complains that the Envy has AMD Radeon, but guess what?  So does the MBP. I'm going out on a limb to say the Apple one is a lot better. But it is still the dreaded Radeon that everybody seems to hate.<br /><br />Displays - You can connect three displays to the Envy and I don't know how many with Thunderbolt. A lot. Fill your house with displays?  Having four screens seems enough, but that's just me.<br /><br />Music -  No contest.  Envy's Beats Audio slaughters the MBP.<br /><br />Camera -  I personally like the Envy camera much more than Apple ones I've used (they adjust better for lighting changes) and it comes with silly software that kids will like. In fairness I haven't spent time with the camera on the newest MBP yet so maybe it's just as good.<br /><br />Battery - the MBP has a good battery.  But I need to complain here that my battery on my iBook never lasted more than an hour or so from its first day and swiftly became non-functional.  This was the word on the battery by 100% of the people on the Apple community board before I bought it. T But I needed a new iBook and there was no other option. Is saying that a new Mac laptop has a long-lasting battery a way of saying that the older ones were pretty bad?<br /><br />Heat - This Envy is the coolest running laptop I've ever had.  I run it all day and it isn't even warm.  It wasn't pleasant to put my iBook on my lap... a scorcher.  No idea about the new MacBook.<br /><br />Warranty - HP gives you a one year limited warranty, but they currently have a special on their site for a free two-year warranty.  I believe they have been reading the bad comments on this page about their service.  Before and after I bought the computer I was quickly able to get a helpful person on the phone.  After my problem was solved I got a  phone call later just to make sure I was okay.  I don't like that kind of thing, but it does show they are trying.  You can buy more coverage from HP for $200.  AppleCare is $349 for three years.  Ouch!<br /><br />Digital Media Reader - The MBP has it this year, but this is one of those, \\\\\"Isn't that amazing?\\\\\" Apple improvements over something that's been pretty standard on PC laptops for years.  If you don't have this year's MBP, I don't think you have this.<br /><br />Included Software - Apple computers used to come with iLife,  but I don't think they do these days.  Envy comes with Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Elements, which are great programs.  They are both harder to learn, less fun, and more powerful than the two similar iLife programs you can get for $40  (and get GarageBand and other great stuff too) Premiere Elements is more like the semi-pro Final Cut Express than iMovie.  On the dark side Envy comes with Norton which I guess is okay unless, like me, you want to get rid of it. If so, good luck! You can get other software to remove it (as I did) or buy another copy of Windows and start clean.  Once Norton moves in, it has no intention of ever leaving.  Tip: Their uninstall doesn't work until you activate the program. There's a limited version of Office, but what good is that?<br /><br />Finally, what I loved about Apple computers when I first started using them were these special treats you get.  Stuff they didn't have to do.  This computer comes with a velvety cover.  That's a little thing but I really like it.  You can do wireless audio. There is apparently something called ProtectSmart which protects your data when you drop the computer.  Add that to the cooling tech and the Beats Audio, etc.  They are out there trying to excel.  In my opinion, these days Apple is putting a lot of their imagination into the iPad and maybe the MacBook Air.  They're coasting on their regular computers.<br /><br />On the downside with the Envy is that they don't give you much printed documentation or even good PDF. I don't want a lot of little files, I want a good manual.  You have to use their online support, which I don't like.  They don't make it easy to see how to make a recovery disc which is something you should do on the first day--when you go to \\\\\"Recovery\\\\\" you don't get that info. (And you better do it right--you only get one chance)  They sell you recovery discs but that is really cheesy.  Recovery discs should come with the machine.  These are the kinds of little details where they would provide a much better customer experience that are well worth charging customers a few bucks more for.<br /><br />I'm not an expert and don't pretend to be, so I hope some people will come in and fix the mistakes in what I've written above.<br /><br />As for a lot of reasons I have to run my Macs in Boot Camp a lot, I am in heaven with this thing. I don't care about the weight as I'm not going to ever take it out of my apartment. Generally I travel with my iPad and a keyboard.  Of course it might break soon or someday, but so could any computer.  I have service plans and the authorized repair place is ten minutes from my home.  I'm feeling good about this purchase and highly recommend it to others.",

It's wireless and installs VERY quickly with no problems    The only downside is that it doesn't use the bluetooth in the mac like the mac mouse/keyboard, you have to use a small USB dongle to install it.

I happen to be a novice setting up PC related stuff but this router was cake to set up. Be forwarned; however, my intention was to simply set up wireless with encryption and nothing else. I had no desire to set up a full blown network with file and printer sharing. I simply wanted encrypted wireless for my xp windows pc and vista windows laptop in the house. I figure I can print stuff by using the pc with the printer or using a flash drive so I had no desire in oversteaping my technical boundries.<br /><br />That being said... it was as simple as putting the disk in, following directions printing the encryption code and connecting the router. Easy as cake! I had more trouble configuring the recieving vista windows laptop and xp windows pc! Which wasn't that hard either. The router is connected to my windows vista desktop and my windows vista laptop and seperate xp windows desktop are recieving the signal. It was as easy as plugging in the code to the recieving laptop and pc.<br /><br />The signal is always strong and no breaks in three weeks of constant use. Despite other comments, the signal strength is awesome even with the unit under a shelf. Unless you live in a 25 room mansion or set up the network wrong... you should have no problems. I have absolutely no complaints. The cherry on top is how awesome this router looks and with no antenna! You could easly hide this under a shelf but why would you want to! It's beautiful and you could use it as decoration! I admit, it is pricey but well worth the money in the headaches you will save setting it up and the aesthetic factor. Highly recommended especially for novices who simply want wireless in their house.",

Its not super heavy or light has a good balance of weight. It glides over my mouse pad and the side buttons feel natural when i need to click them. Other mice i have used feel like I'm reaching to far forward or to far backwards to click their buttons. I've watched a few reviews on youtube and have read a few reviews on amazon about this mouse and none of the issues mentioned have been a problem for me. For instance the software that came with the mouse, first time install; worked perfectly. Regularly the DPI changes as the color changes. But you can set your favorite color to your favorite DPI setting. Also have a &#34;breathing&#34; light (where it fades in and out) you can turn that off as well. I HIGHLY recommend this mouse. IF you interested but are not sold yet. BUY IT and TRY IT. If you don't like it guess what..send it back. its cheap enough for a trial so you not blasting 70 plus tax just to try a mouse. ya know.<br /><br />Again the feel of this mouse is all my opinion.

I have had 2 Toshiba computers, and loved them. I loved them so much, my next one had to be a Toshiba.  It took me over a month to shop for one, and I came up with this one. I hate it. Do not waste your money if you want a consumer friendly computer. This computer is loaded with so many quirks, and ads you cannot get rid of.  The major problem is the tracker/mouse. It either will not work, or you have to click it so hard it is scary.  Or, it is so sensitive you cannot get through a sentence typing without the mouse taking you to other pages, and programs.  You cannot even leave the curser for more than 20 seconds without it deleting the email, taking you to another program or places unknown.  We have gone through all the advanced options and did what we could to prevent these problems, but it doesn't work.  If you are typing an email, you cannot get far before side bar tools come up.  You click to get them closed, doesn't work another pops up.  This is just the start.  This is without a doubt the worst computer I have ever owned.  I will not get another Toshiba, and I discourage anyone from buying this model.  There are times I have lost paragraphs in the blink of an eye. I am not computer illiterate either. I have had IT people look at it, and they suggested I use a plug in mouse, which I do.  it is still bad.<br /><br />Another thing with the mouse pad is there is just a 1/4 inch corner of the right and left lower corners allowed to use for regular use.  If you move outside that area you are in other programs.  You have to bang to click it too.  There are times it does not work at all.<br /><br />I will say, battery lasts  several hours of use. It is light weight, and fairly slim.  The sound is good, and screen is crisp and clear.  Color is good.  I only use the Toshiba tile, which is like the classic windows.  I do not use anythingelse.  Too much trouble.  It is so preloaded with companies who probably paid Toshiba tons of money to promote them.<br />Never again.  In a few months I am getting an Apple and get rid of this consumer unfriendly computer .",

Not for the whole of humanity, of course, just for me in terms of making my life easier/less annoying.  This was my fourth kindle - I bought one for my daughter, and I also dropped one from a height onto a hard surface, breaking it.  Amazon replaced the one I broke without charge or fuss, meaning I now heart Amazon beyond all reason.   Kindle is so convenient, so portable, so easy to read in bed or anywhere else, I now resent when I have to read something from a stupid old paper book, but, in the interests of fairness and in denial of my irrational love for a huge, multinational, American-based corporation, I must list the minor drawbacks:    1. Not enough books are available on Kindle.  Many of the books I want to read aren't yet in Kindle format.  2. Lots of books are not available in my region (outside the U.S.), but are recommended to me anyway.  3. I ended up buying a lot of drivel, because the review system is such that a few bonkers people giving a book five stars will skew the overall rating upwards.   I know this isn't Amazon's or the Kindle's fault, but it is a drawback.  4. The cost.  Because buying a book is so easy and fast, I have ended up spending an absolute fortune.  Again, not the Kindle's fault, more to do with my own lack of fiscal discipline, but be warned.    On the other hand, you need never be stuck for something to read again.  Will work anywhere, as long as there is mobile phone coverage.  Books download in minutes, and the operation of the Kindle is - I was going to say child's play, but most kids are way more techno-savvy than I am - middle aged woman's play. Can be operated one-handed, which really counts when you're snuggled up under the duvet.  I synch-ed mine to my IPhone, so in idle moments in queues or waiting rooms, I can haul out my phone and continue the book I'm reading, without having to lug anything around in my bag.      Finally, people ask if I miss the texture and smell and tactile experience of reading \\\\\"real\\\\\" books.  Em, no.  Not even slightly.  No more stacks of books building up on my bedside table, no more packing heavy volumes to take with me when I travel.  No more waiting days for books to come in the post, or to get into town to visit the book shop.  We still have hundreds of books in our house - we converted one of the bedrooms into a library - most of which I want to keep, but if I never bought another again it wouldn't bother me.

Devices showed more \\\\\"bars,\\\\\" but actual throughput did not improve over the Linksys. I purchased the R20000G hoping to overcome interference issues in my apartment (25+ AP's visible on the 2.4 band). It performs no better than the Linksys E4200 it was intended to replace.<br /><br />2) Feature set: lacks a common consumer router feature called \\\\\"port translation\\\\\" when configuring firewall rules. Amped tech support confirmed their products lack this feature. In addition, many advanced technical settings available on Linksys/Netgear/D-Link routers are not available on the R20000G<br /><br />3) Tech support: I used the Amped web support form to submit a question about port translation (referenced above). I received a two sentence email response *two days* later, saying sorry, their products do not support that feature. They promote their free \\\\\"Elite Support\\\\\" service, but a two day delay in response to a simple email inquiry is unacceptable in my opinion.<br /><br />Postive:<br />1) The physical product seems reasonably well built and includes ventilation on top & bottom.<br />2) The initial setup wizard was fast and easy, and could have be completed by a novice.<br /><br />I am returning the product to Amazon since it lacks a very basic and common feature (port translation).",

Takes forever to move through running apps and is extremely sluggish when doing simple tasks. On top of that, constant freezing/crashing when loading HTML5 video, playing on many apps, and even basic internet browsing on Chrome. My Samsung Galaxy S3 out-performs it in every way, despite being an older device. It also doesn't help that the hard-drive on mine was 2 GB when it was advertised as 8.<br /><br />Don't believe in the advertised camera quality either. Pictures come out looking like the lens was covered in frosted glass, with horrendous quality and fuzzy images. Also the video recording is extremely laggy.<br /><br />On top of that, for whatever reason, on the corners of my tablet, there are extremely bright white lights that shine through the back of the case (which is made by a really cheap material that bends easily, by the way) and is very obnoxious/distracting in dark environments.<br /><br />The touch calibration is also awful. The pointer is almost always nowhere near my finger and takes many tries before I can press a button/tab accurately. On top of that, the screen continues on the left pass the black area, so part of the display is &#34;missing&#34; in a way. On top of that, you cannot re-calibrate the touchpad, so you're stuck screwing around with your finger on the screen.<br /><br />It also came with a ton of bloatware apps, like performance boosting apps or cleaning apps that barely work. In fact, these apps always show pop-up menus or are impossible to exit out of, so they constantly get in your way until you uninstall them.<br /><br />To top of this heaping pile of garbage, the display is not as great as they advertise it to be. I can literally count the pixels on the screen. Following this, my wallpaper always re-sizes itself whenever i go back to the home menu, incredibly zoomed in so it looks awful. I constantly have to go back and re-set my wallpaper, only to have it resized and zoomed in all the way again.<br /><br />Please, muster up the will to spend an extra $50 dollars or so to get a better brand tablet, because this genuinely isn't worth the money at all.",

If you do a quick search online you'll see that I'm not the only person with ongoing issues with charging. The problems started when the charger stopped working. I would plug it in and nothing would happen. This caused the battery to completely drain out, which then messed up the system somehow. I checked with Google support to do a &#34;hard&#34; reboot and that started it up, but the charger still only actually worked about 1/3 of the time. That slowly turned into about 5%--and I noticed that it would lose power even when it showed it was charging, so something else was wrong. It would be plugged in, show the &#34;charging&#34; signal, but I could sit there and watch it lose power a percentage point at a time. At this point I thought maybe the charger was broken, and I bought a new one on Amazon. This one didn't work any better.<br />Google said it wasn't covered by warranty and I should refer to the store where I bought it. The store said I needed to contact ASIS. I had a hell of a time getting in touch with Asis, who then said that I had voided the warranty by using this second charger and not just the charger that came with the device.<br />Man, oh man.<br />So, my Google Nexus has been sitting on my shelf, &#34;charging&#34; for several weeks now, but will only occasionally turn on just long enough for it to ask me to plug in my charger and then shut itself off.<br />I do not recommend the Google Nexus.

I am also having severe vision problems,so having the backlit screen and enlarged fonts. I loved it when it arrived, and still do when it's working properly. Some things weren't as good as we hoped, the battery life is very limited, only 6 hours, very poor compared to other models. Definitely needs improvement. I don't dare download movies or music, because it only has 5 GB of space, a chunk of which is needed for the OS. The more it's loaded the slower it goes. The Cloud space is limited to 5000 books, once you buy them, they're yours forever and once the cloud is filled that's it. For a heavy reader like me I'd like to see options for increasing space, even if I have to pay a reasonable fee. The magazine selection is poor,the newspapers section worse. As for apps I found a few, but honestly they're mostly for children or young people.<br /><br />But the piece'de resistance, is the ongoing problem with charging unit and cord.

I asked my wife how she liked my screen protector and she said, &#34;I don't see it.&#34; HA! I can feel it, but, without looking for the edges, it's not there. Shining it in the light revealed two small surface defects that remind me that there's plastic on there and those happen to be on the parts where the screen is not lit (the frame??).

Things ranging from their own software to Windows 8 applications. Just be warned. About 50 GB of the 120 in the SSD was filled by their junk (and the OS of course). It would be nice if they gave you the option to install certain applications that were located on a CD that came with the laptop. Either way, it is still pretty good.<br /><br />I will be removing 85% of the applications that came pre-installed on this laptop in order to clear up room for what I originally got it for: gaming and working.<br /><br />EDIT: I have changed my original rating of 4 stars to 1 star. This is because there was faulty hardware in the system. I got this error when trying to boot up one time - PAGE_IN_NONPAGED_AREA. Essentially, this means that there is something wrong with the RAM or GPU. Not exactly sure which one it is.<br /><br />I was having problems very early on running games like League of Legends and KOTOR 2. LoL would randomly freeze/hang for 2 or so seconds whenever a fight started, and then would fast forward to my death. KOTOR 2 is an older game and shouldn't have any problems with 1) running less-intensive graphics and 2) running at a lower resolution. However, occasionally when a fight would break out, the game would hang for 1-2 seconds, then resume. I was able to move my mouse but the actual game content froze. This would also happen when I tried to open up boxes, transition into certain areas, etc.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about all of this is that I was able to run games like Far Cry 3, Skyrim (with mods), and Sim City 5 at the max resolution and graphics settings without any hang at all! At no time did the game randomly freeze or give me any sort of issue. So, when the hardware worked, it ran beautifully. However, I didn't pay $2000 to own a faulty machine that didn't run all kinds of games smoothly (or only ran them well part of the time).<br /><br />I'm just glad my problems with this laptop started arising within the first two weeks of me owning this product. I'm returning this product today using my 30-day warranty. Please be aware that if you do buy this product, you run the risk of purchasing faulty hardware.

This Fintie case has better/tighter fit.  iPad doesn't move at all when put into the case.  This is important because if you drop your iPad on the corner, if it moves too much in the case, it will actually hit the landing surface and damages your iPad.  The corner of my iPad already been damaged while I used the i-Blason case before.<br />2. The base/back cover is a little bit bigger.  This is also important in protecting your iPad when you drop it.  The larger back offsets the iPad away from the edge of the case further thus gives the iPad more tolerance not to hit the landing surface when dropped.<br />3. The magnet on the cover is stronger.  This holds the cover in position better.<br />4. Great Price!<br /><br />I bought 2 for my sons' iPad.  I'm buying one more for myself.<br />I would recommended this case.<br /><br />Updates 08/31/15:<br />After I got one for myself and used it for over a month.  Personally, I think there's one design flow to this case.  As I mentioned in my original review, the bottom/back side is bigger than the other brand I had before which provides better drop protection.  However, later on I realized that only the outer edge where you open the cover is bigger which is what actually provides drop protection when drop on that edge.  The problem I see now is the inside / bottom edge is too small.  When I put the iPad in the standing position, the bottom of the iPad itself actually protruded out and hit the table surface. And because of that, if you drop your iPad on this edge, the iPad might be damaged.  I suggest that the manufacture make the inside edge 1/4&#34; larger to give it better protection.  However, doing so may make the fit of the cover &#34;loose&#34; as there might be too much slack on the cover but I rather have better protection than tight fit.  Other than this issue, this is a great case. For this reason, I removed 1 star from the original 5 stars I gave.",

I have tried the cases with a light that hook right onto your kindle, I have tried clip on lights, (don't advice,) and now have settled with using a kindle light that attaches to your device. I have not upgraded to any other model; I have been using the 3g keyboard kindle, waiting for a model to be released that had its own lighting- paperwhite. I was all set to click purchase until I read a review that said they dropped the mp3 from this model. Now I usually READ the books I download, but at night, when eyes are getting tired, I bookmark the spot I am at, and turn on the text to speech setting, listening till I fall asleep. (Since book marked, it doesn't take to much effort to find where I fell out, and stopped listening so I can continue reading.<br /><br />It is this, and only this that is keeping me from upgrading to the paperwhite. Any chance that the developers will add mp3 again to a new release of paperwhite will have me jumping to buy. I just don't think I will purchase one until this happens.

As always, the Kindle also readily takes files transferred from the computer, no fuss or secret tricks, just use it like a USB drive.<br /><br />I was a little surprised that this one seems to lack the audiobook capability (neither speakers nor headphone jack) of the older one, but that was probably a somewhat silly feature anyway.<br /><br />All in all, product is as expected and I have no complaints.

            "input": "I'm a huge android fan and was trying to decide between this and the Samsung tab for my daughter. I have a Samsung Note and everyone in our home has Samsung Galaxy S4 phones. I've also had other Android tablets in the past. I picked this because it had a bit faster processor speed than the Tab and the tech reviews online were glowing. However, I've found it to be an awful watered-down version of an Android tablet, with many Android apps and features just not available because of the dumbed down interface that forces use of Amazon app store and prohibits access to the main and largest Android app store, Google Play. It also lacks other great android features commonly found on the Samsung and Nexus Android tablets.<br /><br />What this means:<br /><br />If you have bought apps in the Google play store in the past (for previous tablets, phone, etc.) you WILL NOT be able to access them, download them, or use them at all on this tablet unless you root it, which then invalidates all warranties, etc. (and you also need decent tech abilities were you to want to try to root it).  The interface does not allow you to download the Google Play store, nor can you try to get apps from it via the browser, as something about the way they've programmed the Fire essentially makes it invisible to the Android Play store, so that the store doesn't recognize the Fire tablet as being an Android.<br /><br />Even if you've never bought anything from the Google Play store, it's still a bummer for you because the Amazon app store has a VERY limited selection of apps. If you're getting this for your kid, they want to change the wall papers and personalize the tablet. There is a very limited selection of not very interesting wallpapers and it's just not optimized to enhance your experience by customizing it with apps you'd like because the selection is so very limited. I have about 30 some apps in my Google play account. Once owned, you can use them for any of your Android products (usually) and once you login to your google account you have easy access to download them all to your new device. Can't do that with the Fire at all. So even if it does have some of the apps I like and use, I'd have to pay for them again, via the Amazon app store in order to have them. I have a bunch of medical apps that I use and some of them are available in the Amazon store, but most are not. Same with the apps my daughter has and even more so with the wallpapers and other personalizations that are typically available for Android products.<br /><br />My daughter, when checking out this tablet and attempting to customize it, was seriously disappointed and upset with it, stating &#34;my Android phone has more capabilities and things to do with it than this tablet!&#34;. If your kid is at all tech savvy they will hate this tablet.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems like Amazon has taken a great little tablet but stripped it of it's great abilities in order to force-funnel all owners into buying from their limited app store, streaming only their videos and music, disallowing access to other great media and news and useful applications that are found in the Google Play store, thus limiting it's capabilities. There may be other sites that it limits the use of as I didn't do an exhaustive search, prohibiting Google Play access was enough for me to know we'd never be happy with it.  I'd say the apps it comes with, already loaded are disappointing as well when compared to what comes on a real android tablet (one that lets you access the full world of apps, music, books & magazines, blogs & posts, etc. that most every other Android tablet can access) It's kind of like buying a truck but blocking off the back bed area (the box area where you can put tons of stuff, the essential part of a truck that makes it so useful..) so that you can never put anything in it or use it, you can only put stuff in the front cab - why bother with a truck then?<br /><br />If you want a true Android with allthe capabilities of an android (and I can think of no reason that you wouldn't want that...) then you really need to buy an alternate Android tablet. I'd suggest looking at the Samsung tablets, such as the tab or note. I am not an Apple fan at all, but I would even say to get an iPad over this tablet as it's capabilities have just been too stunted by the limits imposed by Amazon's interface.  It's very disappointing as in general I'm a huge Amazon fan and I love my Amazon Fire TV and basic kindle. However, with this they've very much disappointed me. This tablet is limited to streaming video & music from Amazon, downloading Amazon books and light/limited internet browsing. It's true capabilities have been cut off.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Severely limited use as you can't access the thousands of apps and goodies on Google Play as the Amazon interface prohibits downloading the Google Play app and has made the tablet unrecognizable as an Android if you access Google Play via the browser. You'd have to root it in order to change this which will invalidate your warranty. This denied access to Google Play severely limits the capabilities of your tablet. If you want a real Android tablet with full functionality look at the Samsung Tab or Samsung Note instead. The decision by Amazon to prohibit full access to the plethora of Android features and apps is very disappointing.the capabilities of an android (and I can think of no reason that you wouldn't want that...) then you really need to buy an alternate Android tablet.

When I received, promptly it must be said... in my case... boxes and boxes of nothing but GREEN cables, I was greatly disappointed. I immediately called the third party supplier who claimed, \\\\\"Yes, I know the picture is misleading, but Amazon won't allow us to change the picture.\\\\\" He then offered to do whatever it took to make me happy... while muttering under his breath that some of the other colors were in some way of inferior quality. I almost believed his mea culpa claim about Amazon until I subsequently visited his own corporate webstore where presumably they DO have direct control over the images used for their various products... and yes, there were the same MISLEADING pictures of 10 cables in 10 colors.     CONCLUSION:  This merchant knowingly misleads its customers... and I haven't even tested the veracity of their claim to being CAT 6 yet! I don't recommend doing business with merchants who intentionally mislead their customers.",

Though I have perused many forums/pc-partpicker/amazon/newegg and finally did it as an 2013 Xmas gift to myself!!<br /><br />I've always wanted to build a computer for years but I could not find the right case. It was always either overly designed (\\\\\"gaming cases\\\\\") or just plain boring. The really nice cases such as Lian Li were too expensive. When I found the Define R4 I had to get it. The reviews were mostly, if not all, very positive.<br /><br />I'll try to touch as many bases as I can:<br /><br />[PROS]<br /><br />- doesnt look like a typical gamer fast and furious honda civic sir crx rice rocket case<br /><br />- all 7 fans are 140mm; able to run lower rpm while keeping temps very cool and quiet.<br /><br />- easy-access dust filters. just slide out, clean, DONE.<br /><br />- built in 3 speed fan controller (5v, 7v, 12v) for up to 3 fans. i have it controlling 2 intake fans and turn it up to 12v for gaming.<br /><br />- built in cable management grommets and tie-downs with included zip ties. makes me look like a freaking PRO<br /><br />- adjustable hard drive cages; turn it 90 degrees, remove top cage. move it back to fit a front radiator. or even remove it completely!<br /><br />- sound deadening material on the top, side panels, and behind the front door<br /><br />- very minimal subdued design. blank front panel. case is free from any branding.<br /><br />- thick chassis and panels make it extremely solid.<br /><br />- extremely roomy interior<br /><br />- extremely versatile case for air cooling, watercooling, leave hd cages and use as a NAS box. it can be anything you want it to be without any modifications.<br /><br />- SO MANY FEATURES for less than $ 100<br /><br />[CONS]<br /><br />- due to manufacturing, the fan cutouts on top slightly concave down. The base intake cut outs also concave inward.<br />(I've contacted Fractal Design and they stated they have corrected that flaw. Not sure if it qualifies as a defect but its hardly noticeable unless you really stare at it.)<br /><br />- this may be knit picky but there is no dedicated HDD activity light, just a single BRIGHT blue power led.<br />(you can connect the LEDs to the hdd activity instead of power led)<br /><br />- fan controller connector disconnects when you remove the entire front panel<br /><br />- side intake fan vent has no dust filter<br /><br />- reset button is not recessed deep enough to prevent accidental resets<br /><br />- 5.25\\\\\" drive bay is not removable--like the Midi Arc R2<br /><br />*******Just some details to know********<br /><br />- if you're only using the lower hdd cage, installing a 3.5\\\\\" 7200 rpm hard drive on the lowest tray will cause the hd's vibrations to resonate through your case. it will be a very audible and annoying, at least for me. no amount of anti-vibration products will fix that unless you move it the hdd else where. it only happens on that bottom tray. I have it installed in 5.25\\\\\" drive bay with brackets. i barely notice it spooling up.<br /><br />- make sure you connect the fan controller molex the right orientation to the PSU molex or the fan speeds wont work correctly.<br /><br />- some fans, like Noctua, need at least 7v to power on and spin. 5v is not enough and you will see your fan twitch but not spin.<br /><br />- if you plan on using custom casefeet, be aware that the front/rear screw holes are not aligned. the rear screws are closer to the outer edge to allow clearance for intake cut-outs and dust filter. i put larger casefeet (akin to hi-fi amplifiers) and the rear feet stick out way more. i actually kind of like it staggered look but thats me.<br /><br />4/5 stars bc my vents concave. everything else is absolutely perfect.",

The blank feature works well, although that is not something I regularly use.  I don't use the program switcher button at the top, and am not sure how helpful it really is.

Like many, I was one who thought I would miss the feel of a book.  Well, I still have books and I'll still read conventional books.  But the Kindle is a fantastic supplement so to speak.  It's perfect for reading in bed too, especially with my little clip on light.  Then I can just read until I'm sleepy.  I did buy the leather folder cover for it so it feels more like a book now but even before that, it was fine.  I just wanted to splurge a little.       The Kindle has so many features I love.  I love being able to determine the size type I want (although the standard is perfect for me and as easy to read as a conventional book).  I love being able to scroll down my downloaded books and if I've started reading, for the Kindle to \\\\\"open\\\\\" at the place I left off.  I love being able to download excerpts and read them at my leisure.  I love the highlighter function so I can just look at all my highlights in a book whenever I want or find it easily when I want to share a passage with a friend.  I love the almost instantaneous downloads of purchased books, i.e. I was listening to a CD the other day and the speaker mentioned a book that seemed really interesting.  So right then and there I downloaded the book and started reading almost immediately.  I love that I got so many classics for free and that so many books are available for .99 cents, $2.99 and $4.99.  (I initially downloaded 30 books for $42.99).  I love having the dictionary feature right there so I can look up a word.  And I love being able to shop in the Kindle store with the wireless capability while sitting in my favorite easy chair.  I haven't looked into the e-mail capability yet, but that in itself is a wonderful feature to have.    It took me awhile to take the plunge because I really do love the look and feel of books, but now I am SO happy Idid.  I just LOVE my Kindle and can't wait to take it on vacation.",

            "input": "I like old things. I love old movies (30s, 40s, 50s) and I love old books, the smell, the feel.  But I also like long Novels and series...for example, I have about 15 of the Eternal Champion Omnibus editions...bringing only two of those huge books on a trip would add some weight to whatever bag they were in.    My first experience with a kindle was a kindle 2 white versions a CEO at a company I worked for received from Amazon. Then, I thought it would be a phase or something like the webTV or web appliance things that companies bring out every few years. The CEO booted it up and showed me how \\\\\"cool\\\\\" he thought it was, but I remained unconvinced that anyone would prefer that over a book.  Cut to 4 some odd years later and a coworker is showing me his Kindle 3. Smaller, lighter, and brighter, the Kindle 3 amazed me...and having been using the iPhone for a year, I kept trying to turn the pages by swiping the screen!  I told myself that I would eventually get one.    After drooling over it for more than a year, last week I picked up the 3G+wifi version as an early Father's day gift, from Best Buy.   My first impression: They need to put a small sticker or something in the Quick Start guide that says something like: The screen on your kindle is not an overlay. Please do not try to remove. Simply turn the unit on!!  Like others, I was trying to figure out how to peel off the button layout \\\\\"Overlay\\\\\" after pulling off the screen and case protectors. In a rare moment of clarity, I turned the unit on and was amazed. I was literally going to ask if someone had a razor blade I could use to pry!!    It's smaller than I thought, with a leather case/light; it's about the same size as a DVD case with slip cover, very convenient.  With the big books I mentioned above and even some of the thicker paper backs, reading can be a strain on my hands, arms, and shoulders, but my neck as well. The kindle is light even with the case.    The buttons are ok. I'd have preferred a QWERTY keyboard with separate numbers, but it's not a deal breaker. The page turning buttons are a bit confusing for me. Both sides of the kindle have the back and forward button in the same orientation...and it's taking me a bit of getting used to. Often I hold the kindle with my right hand and hit the next page button with my right thumb...to go back a page I have been mistakenly hitting the left forward button. I understand that having the buttons the way they are is convenient for both lefties and righties, but my poor old brain is having a time adjusting. This is more my fault than the layout of the kindle.  Page turns are crisp and efficient.  Reading multiple books at once is as easy as going back to the home page and choosing a new book...I don't even have to worry about bookmarking the page, each book selected goes back to the last page I was on. Nice.    The screen, in daylight, is amazing. The eInk is clear and very readable. When I was picking it up at best buy the salesmen was suggesting I need a light. At first I wasn't going to bother but I did want a case and saw the official leather case with LED light so I got it.  My only complaint with the light is that it is angles so it's facing the top right corner of the kindle with the rest of the unit getting the part of the light. So far I haven't had any issues reading in complete darkness...but I would like to have been able to bend the neck of the light a bit to cover more of the kindle.       Reading books couldn't be easier. Although, I would like to be able to customize the \\\\\"table of contents\\\\\" for the kindle...meaning I would like to be able to put which books I wanted on the home page...almost like what you can do with apps on the Android or iPhone...A customized home screen, if you will. I would also have liked to be able to customize the screen saver...an app to create grayscale copies of your fav pics to be added to the kindle would be awesome!     I picked up the 3G+Wifi because I when I do travel, I might not have access to wifi hotspots...in checking the coverage for 3G, even remote areas I have been to and will travel to in the future, such as Oxcutzkab, Yucatan, Mexico, have coverage!    I definitly recommend to anyone that likes to read...get the kindle...well worth it.",

Disappointing that this isn't fixed on the C920 by at least increasing the resistance a little or have it done in software.<br /><br />It has come to my attention (from comments below) that this webcam actually has a 3 megapixel sensor and Logitech gets its 15 megapixels by using software! That explains the worse image quality.<br /><br />Pros: The C920 has a standard tripod mount. This is useful for mounting to mini-tripods that can be placed anywhere on your desk. On board video encoder means it will reduce CPU usage (but still wasn't enough to use on G+ Hangouts with anymore people in the room than with the C910 on a laptop running with AMD C-50, 2GB ram)<br /><br />Cons: Worse image quality than the C910. This might be due to the fact that it uses a 3 MP sensor versus the 5 MP on the C910. Tests were done subjectively in Skype, Google Hangouts, and from recorded video via Logitech's own software at 720P and 1080P. Running on an AMD 965 BE quad core 3.4 Ghz, 4 GB Ram, Windows 7 64 Bit.

Very noticeable color banding, horrible viewing angles. It does not look 1080p. Its washed out and hard to read/look at.<br />*  It gets very hot in a couple of spots, but it seems most laptops get hot.<br />*  It isn't always sure if its a tablet or a phone.<br />*  The touchpad is also just sad. The click actuation should have never left R&D this way. The sensitivity is all over the place.<br /><br />There a lot of nice things that would happen when I opened this thing up. ok google at any time, widgets, oh the widgets.

I read the reviews for most of the ones on Amazon and decided to purchase this one due to the review and the price.  I couldn't be happier!  The monitors are very sturdy and the adjustments you can make to the positioning is awesome.  I didn't expect the level of customization that you could do in terms of monitor location.  Once you get the monitor in your desired location you can tighten the arms down in a fashion where the monitors can still be rotated easily by hand but they are stable and you do not have to worry about them falling.<br /><br />I was also worried about making this purchase because my new desk has a glass top and I was afraid that the mounting bracket would crack the glass because of the type of device used to tighten it to the desk top.  Once I put it in place and began to tighten it I found that my worries were not valid and the product worked perfectly.  I did cut some of the box that it was packed in and place the cardboard over the metal screws at the bottom where it touched the glass just to be safe but it was probably not even needed.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product though and if you are in the market for a dual monitor stand I highly recommend this product.

I didn't order the tower last year with a wireless card, as I have a heavy duty laptop for use when the power is out, and I have had a pay-as-you-go dial-up plan since 2006 for those moments when the cable is down. Found out the hard way earlier this month that the dial-up service went kaput (not even so much as a warning email), so I had to act fast to obtain backup internet access. I added a portable hotspot to my cell service, which would give me 4G LTE data speed... and the laptop connected to it instantly. But the tower needed an antenna. After reading various reviews, I opted for this one.<br /><br />It set up easily on the Windows 8 Pro x64 tower - driver loaded from the supplied CD, plugged the unit into one of the USB 3.0 ports, and it found the hotspot right away. Was able to connect to my work server with no problem, and a speed test showed reasonable speed... not as fast as my cable (60 Mbps down/6 up), but certainly comparable to DSL at 7 down/3 up... and way better than 56K dial-up.<br /><br />This antenna is exactly what I needed - it's portable (can be carried forward to a new computer), doesn't require a power cord or transformer, and it works as intended. Can't ask for more than that.<br /><br />(I did purchase this from a different retailer - didn't know it was on amazon till this evening)",

Smooth powerful sound for \\\\\"powered computer speakers.\\\\\"<br /><br />And I appreciate Harman Kardon giving these speakers an honest 80 watts \\\\\"RMS\\\\\" rating instead of some funkier, faker, exaggerated rating.  Some sound systems have more than 80 watts in a single channel, but 80 watts total in \\\\\"computer speakers\\\\\" is still enough to annoy your parents, if you want.<br /><br />My biggest criticism of the HK595 speakers is that the Bass and Treble controls don't provide a lot of range.  I usually have the Bass at minimum and the Treble at maximum, which might suggest a tendency towards muddiness if the tone controls were centered.  But the equalizer in my Winamp media player is sufficient to push more than enough trebles for speech and snare drums.  The speakers can reproduce 'em easily, but there's just not a lot of treble boost from their onboard adjustment, so you'll need some additional equalization before the signal gets to these speakers.<br /><br />When everyone leaves the house and Jimmy Hendrix gets turned up to eliminate any residual inner-ear cilia that haven't died yet, I might also turn up the Bass control on the 595s.  That eliminates the need to have the bass sliders getting too wavy on the Winamp equalizer.  But the equalizer will need to boost the trebles, anyway.<br /><br />The dog has a different opinion.  When the volume gets that loud, she leaves.<br /><br />This is all with analog coming out of the computer's regular speaker jacks.  Maybe the tone controls have completely different behavior if you use digital audio input.  It would be interesting to hear.<br /><br />With analog input I have added an inline rotary volume control [[ASIN:B00001P4XH Koss VC20 Volume Control]] for convenience.

Was replacing a 2.5\\\\\" Toshiba 160GB 5400rpm hard drive in my mid 2009 MacBook Pro 13\\\\\" (with 8gb of RAM). My laptop is only compatible with SATA II (3gbit/s transfer) and not SATA III (6gbit/s) - this SSD drive is SATA III, but is backward compatible with SATA II as well. Installation of the SSD drive was pretty simple, had to remove the bottom lid and four t6 torx screws from the HDD itself. Fired up the laptop and started the install of Mac OS X Leopard. I had to format the SSD drive first, so that Mac OSX would be able to recognize the ssd drive. After OSX was installed, i started to test the speediness. Boot up time from hitting the power on button used to be 53 seconds with the Toshiba HDD and now is 14 seconds flat (SSD) till I see my desktop! I'm real satisfied with the drop in time for a cold boot up. I use my laptop mostly for VMWare and Excel spreadsheet work. A virtualized Windows XP machine now takes about 41 seconds to boot with the SSD, while the Toshiba HDD took about 57 seconds. Opening an Excel spreadsheet for the very first time (after boot up) with the SSD takes about 3.5 seconds, it took about 16 seconds with the Toshiba HDD (after boot up as well) - big jump in speed! I listen to Pandora a lot on Firefox and was hoping that Adobe Flash, which is utilized predominantly by the site, would function better, but alas it does not - still causes occasional stuttering. I suppose an SSD can't alleviate much of that frustration. Firing up Mozilla Firefox 3 is near instantaneous, though it was speedy earlier as well. I did happily notice that when i quit out of Firefox while Pandora is playing, it's instant - used to take ~2 seconds before (annoyed me back then). I'm not seeing too many 'rainbow wheels' so far, but that could be alluded to the clean OSX install - that's normal for all new operating system installs. Since this drive is only 64gb in size, one should get it if they intend to install only their operating system/mission critical applications on it - large videos/music should be kept on either an external USB drive or a regular platter based HDD. I myself still have about 30gbs left after copying my important documents and (1) virtual machine. Prices for SSD drives are still very expensive @ $2.00/gb, whereas a regular HDD is about $0.11/gb as of today. Only four stars due to the high price!

            "input": "Fool me once, shame on Asus.  Other than its relatively slow eMMC internal storage specification, the TF700 boasted a pretty spectacular set of specs on paper and was lauded as a groundbreaking design when introduced in mid-2012.  It's a tablet I have used for hours a day since buying late that year.  However, as numerous others have described in support forums and customer reviews:  with ongoing use it has become chronically laggy and slow (far slower than dial-up speed slow); yet under warranty terms, users may not unlock it to install required fixes.  When it takes 19 minutes to navigate four web pages and send an email link from each - an operation that should take 60 seconds in a skilled operator's hands - game is over.  Worse:  Asus stopped issuing needed software updates just one year after release, so buyers are still stuck on Jellybean 4.2.1 as of Dec 2014.  That's disappointing (and probably a little outrageous) for a tablet priced far higher than its competitors and hyped as a premium model at time of sale.  Ironically:  had Asus pushed a Kitkat update (instead of stagnate this model at v4.2.1), it probably would have gone a long way to correct many of the storage inefficiencies that drag this model into the toilet.  Quite a few individual owners have jailbroken their TF700s to force a Kitkat upgrade - and found their nearly-dead TF700s gain remarkable new life.  That manual upgrade, along with a few efficiency utilities, help overcome one of the prominent reasons for TF700's poor performance:  its use of eMMC storage.  (The HowToGeek site provides a smart explanation for how that becomes a performance bottleneck in &#34;eMMC vs. SSD: Not All Solid-State Storage is Equal&#34;:  eMMC storage works well for data storage but provides slower access than SSD, so it's better suited for long-term storage than it is for, say, fast reads/writes required by an operating system.)  Another major TF700 performance drag:  bloatware.  I never grasped how significant that can be, till I owned a TF700.  I always thought bloatware meant:  a few extra unwanted apps that the consumer could ignore or uninstall.  But independent developers have identified TF700 bloatware modules which persistently communicate its device status back to Asus (current software version, GPS location, more).  When still supported by publisher, such utilities made some sense (after all, TF700 received a few pushed upgrades during its initial months) but once the publisher abandoned the model, these legacy apps, still aggressively chewing up resources, act more like an anchor.  After unlocking and learning how to use ADB (Android Data Bridge), I removed the associated CMClient, DMClient and Parental Lock - and experienced a remarkable performance gain as a result, in just one of my own experiments with the model.  So the solution is:  buy a replacement (better) tablet, or rescue this expensive model by repairing or replacing its software.  I prefer a repair, rather than tossing away this expensive model.  But applying a replacement custom ROM is skilled IT work requiring a self-study project to safely deploy - and as I learned, the vastly greater operating speed may also come with issues not fully debugged for bluetooth or DRM support:  I temporarily lost bluetooth remote speaker stereo pairing (since fixed) and permanently lost Tivo streaming because the Tivo publisher blocks that app if the tablet has been repaired by consumer (a publisher choice that robs consumers of fair use of an app for which they paid for supportive streaming hardware - poor choice by Tivo, and one that has rankled many owners).  Betrayed - tired of fighting it - and apparently resigned to having to buy a replacement tablet (since even good custom ROMs built by enthusiasts and freely offered, have their bugs that in my own case broke apps I use all the time):  sure, yeah, I concluded:  I'll buy another tablet.  But:  it won't be an Asus tablet.  Not after this experience.  Ironically, Istill have an Asus desktop tower PC and Win 8 laptop, which continue to be well used and I really like - but they're not locked formats, so they will likely have a longer useful life.  I'll simply advise friends:  how can you trust that the next Asus tablet won't be similarly abandoned by its publisher support within just a year?  - P.S. - Since publishing the above, I've gained some industry and market perspective - and found a custom ROM by one of the open source developers that reshaped my TF700 into a (nearly) new tablet, with stable, fast, highly functional performance.  Perspective.  Asus is hardly alone in marketing tablets with short lifecycles and premature planned obsolescence. Product research suggests the tablet category is premised on short useful lives, presumably to goad consumers into replacing their gear with the next model.  Tablet manufacturers should take a lesson from the music industry, which had to reprice and repackage its products when consumers recognized its price gouging for what it was - and simply stopped buying albums, en masse.  We may already be seeing such a reaction with tablet sales; the latest market projections declare a surprise downward trend, and actually attribute the drop to consumers seeking to extend useful lives of their expensive models.  Can't blame consumers - conditioned to buying cheap, powerful desktop PCs:  they compare value, and feel ripped off if a premium priced tablet has a useful life only 1/3 as long as a comparatively cheaper desktop PC, or comparably priced laptop.  My own moment of zen:  thanks to excellent work by some of the android custom ROM developers who publish in forums (though I may not link here, you'll find them):  I'm happily using a zippy fast &#34;Vanir&#34; Kitkat v.4.4.4 custom ROM now on my TF700, and the sole shortcoming is that Tivo app whose publisher won't let it stream to a rooted tablet (but for now, I'll live with that single fail).  We're all learning, as we go.  Looks like I won't be buying a new tablet soon, after all.  But when I do, I'll seek out a Google Nexus: perhaps unique in the category, they tend to receive publisher upgrades well past their first year.  ____  March 2015 update:  I found a great successor tablet.  Now reviewed at product page for:  Dell Venue 8 7000.",

I'm using this with an HP laptop which also has a back lit kbd. The laptop kbd is like all others: too cramped, too close to the screen. I needed the back light because of where this laptop is stationed in my home. Not really much chance of decent lighting in that corner.<br /><br />The KB800 has this annoying habit of resetting your back lighting settings on you, whenever it feels like it. I set mine to 10 minute timeout and 50%. Without rhyme or reason, the KB7800 resets itself to 1 minute and %25. The only way to get it back where I want it is to turn off the kbd, open the SetPoint program and reset everything like I want it. Click OK to exit then turn on the kbd. It works great, just like I want it, until it stops working like I want it. This may take 30 minutes, it may take 3 minutes.<br /><br />I'm always fighting this thing to keep the back light on.<br /><br />Reading the &#34;support&#34; forum for Logitech and the KB800, I see this is a known problem and has been since 2010. No fixes at all from Logitech. Not even an acknowledgement of the problem. Users trying to help users, no relief in site, and Logitech ignores the issue.<br /><br />So half of my reasons for choosing THIS kbd are gone.

It fits my hands just right and my hands are a little larger than normal for women. Really eases wrist strain. To be fair though it does transfer a little strain further up your arm. I simply switch off between it, a regular mouse, and a trackball pistol grip mouse that strains my thumb. That way no one thing takes all the strain all the time. This one is very quick to respond when you pick it up after using another mouse a while. It has a space underneath for the dongle to store when traveling. DPI switch is on top. Scroll wheel also is a button and has horizontal tilt. Lots of large sliding pads underneath so it slides easily on desk or pad. So far the only small complaint is that it is too easy to accidentally hit the back and forward buttons with your thumb. Everything else about this mouse is perfect.    Writing this part on Sept. 18, 2014. Reduced rating to 3 stars. Maybe I got a bad one? It kept quitting so I kept replacing batteries.

It is bright and will work for the  stated distance well . It is rather narrow though it doesnt illuminate the whole field of camera view equal . Basically you get the center coverred and it fades out to the edges . It has 28 LED's . It comes with a 20 foot power cord . It also turns itself on and off as needed . You can sadly see 28 red dots if you look at it but it sits semi hidden if its the only light in that area you cant miss it so you do loose stealth they should of had a one way lens cover . You can easily supplement area lighting with another lamp but you need the lens that comes in this so just buy it unless you have another way to get the lens too . The threads on the lens are very , very fine so be cautious .They say to focus the camera when and where you put the lens in infront of your monitor . I forgot and had to go back and forth it is much more difficult so listen to them . This is a good ..infact IMHO a must have item if you want to catch theives in a area of no lighting it works perfect inside and very good outside for the stated distance subject to narrow beam limitations .

Specifically, there's a little bit of slop in the front cover (much more than in Apple's front-only cover).  So this case's magnets (which also seem to be weaker than Apple's), which tell the iPad that it's covered and to shut off, inevitably move by themselves just enough to turn the iPad back on (especially if it's inside luggage and experiencing turbulence, or any motion, for that matter).  As a result, the iPad battery drains and dies in a few hours.<br /><br />Worse, since this case covers both the front and back of the iPad, it thermally insulates the iPad from the air around it.  The air ordinarily naturally cools the iPad when it's on, but this simple process can't occur with this cover on, so the iPad gets very very hot when this happens.  Since the iPad 3 has a tendency to run a bit hot in the first place, it gets even hotter in this unnatural configuration.  As everyone knows, heat is the enemy of digital electronics, so this case could actually harm the iPad, or at least reduce its lifespan.<br /><br />This problem needs to be fixed.  A stronger spine should do it.  In the meantime, this case definitely shouldn't be used for travel.",

I am Still, months later, still trying to keep from throwing this piece of junk across the room or across the street.  Where to begin...  1. After hours and hours of adjusting basic \\\\\"default\\\\\" problems and installing my basic Email and social media pages - I found that the 64 bit Windows has a problem with the RAM.  I like to use RealPlayer to download a movie on one tab while watching another movie on another tab or window.  Well, that's not happening.  There is so much ASUS crap and other Pre-installed Stuff that the C drive was showing FULL even though it wasn't.  Yet it reacted as if it were full.  So the RAM wouldn't handle two movies at once.  That was expected in a $150 computer - but not an $800 computer with 8 Gigs sitting there.  So after another few hours (now into days) of twisting the computer into a capable machine - it STILL will not handle more than 2 tabs at one time unless I split between Windows and Firefox.<br />  And on and on.  This Windows 7, 64 bit is about as sound of a computer as the Yugo was a car. 2.  Even the card reader requires twizzers to pull the card out after downloading.  3.  The keyboard is completely Open - allowing the slightest dust under the keys.  I haven't seen such Crappy construction since I had Windows ME.  4. The keyboard is flimsy - needing a solid punch to make the key actually strike/count.  5.  The plug for the Internet connection is weak and often Disconnects if the computer is moved.  This is a problem I now find was a problem Asus has had for quite a while.  6.  There is WAY too advertising about their Extra Features that, once you turn the damn thing on - COSTS Extra after their 2 or 3 weeks of Trial.  And if you Keep all those Special Extra Features - figure spending another $175 Plus.<br />  I don't mind having to Uninstall their pre-programmed Extras.  It's having to search for all the loops all of those Extras have intertwined with other software that takes hours and hours to search for, and Re-Install drivers, update all the new downloads, etc., etc.<br />  This computer was the worst purchase I have ever had from Amazon.  And I know it had nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon and would never hold them responsible for this.  \\\\\"Buyer Beware\\\\\" is the name of This Computer.",

In Amazon's words they sounded fantastic - powerful, rugged, with a worry-free 2 year warranty and all kid-friendly content you can wish for! The reality was far from what they described.    First, the good things:    - The devices are good quality, and so are the cases  - The setup was pretty straightforward  - Adding your Kindle content to kids' profiles was simple, both on the device and through amazon.com interface    The bad:    - Adding anything other than Kindle content is pretty much impossible  - Overdrive library app is not considered educational  - All freetime content is dumped in three jumbo lists (book, apps, videos) with no way to filter or sort them  - Freetime content is generally unimpressive  - No apparent way for kids to access their email or record notes  - The device cannot connect to secure networks  - No camera app (I'd add this to the \\\\\"ugly\\\\\" list, but with very limited amount of memory on the device it's kind of a blessing in disguise)    The ugly:    - About 3.5 gigabytes of usable space, so no movies and no music for your road trips  - No way to clean up kid's content from the parent's profile  - It is *super easy* to cheat on the reading requirement: open a book, flip through a few pages, put the device down. In about 10 minutes when it will go to sleep pick it up and check the remaining reading time - it will decrease by those 10 minutes. Rinse and repeat until the games are unlocked (don't tell this to the kids!)    Sadly, all indicates that Amazon both cut the corners on the hardware (3.5 gigabytes, really?!) and then rushed this product to the market before the holiday season with lousy, bare bones software. The last part can be fixed in the subsequent updates, but the first one will plague this device until the next hardware revision :-((    Right now I'm planning to return our Kindles as soon as my kids (inevitably) start complaining about constantly running out of memory, and replace them with some other Android tablets.    *** Update ***    And just as anticipated the first of my kids to receive his gift already ran out of memory. Of course I found out about it right after buying Minecraft app, when it refused to install. I could not clean up kid's stuff from my parental account (good decision, Amazon!), so I had to hunt for downloaded items in the unsorted mess of the kid's account. After I went through every single item twice, there are still about 2GB that are unaccounted for, leaving about 800MB of usable space for everything from now on. Wow... I expected the memory becoming an issue, but not as bad as this and not fast as this! These devices are heading back to the mothership first thing over the coming weekend :-(((    *** Update #2 ***    One thing Amazon does perfect is handling returns. I shipped both devices back and they initiated return as soon as UPS code was in the system. A couple days later I got my money back and ordered two ASUS Nexus 7 (2013) tablets. Between Netflix and YouTube movies, and Kindle and Overdrive books kids will have enough content.    A final note: one of other reviewers mentioned this quote from Bezos: \\\\\"8GB is dead on arrival. We're starting Kindle HD at 16GB\\\\\". This was said full two years before Amazon rolled out this disaster of a product, so, I guess, they don't really take to the heart what their fearless leader says. Perhaps they should, next time.",

You can get better for only a little bit more. HOWEVER, if you are buying these for a laptop/netbook, they are worth it! The reason I bought these speakers was because my netbook's speakers are very soft (as would be expected from a netbook). What's nice about these speakers is that they are powered off of the USB port on my netbook so that I can carry them wherever I want and not have to worry about plugging them into a wall outlet.   That being said, these are great sounding speakers if you take them for what they are. They are 1.2 watts total... i.e. very weak speakers. However, I would never have guessed that. They have great highs, very good mids, and the bass is adequate for small, portable speakers without a subwoofer. They were worth the money I paid for them (albeit, I paid less than what they are right now).  P.S. I listen to a few different types of music. They include acoustic/piano (Sara Bareilles, Ingrid Michaelson, Jason Mraz and that type), dubstep/house/electronic/dance, instrumental only music. and all of it sounds good on these speakers (the electronic type music definitely sounds better with a subwoofer, especially dubstep. but these speakers still do fine with it).",

I've installed quite a few so I did the dance of making sure my hands were clean and that the screen was spotless using the included micro fibre. It was definitely harder to install than ones I've done in the past (on phones and tablets).<br /><br />All-in-all I do not like the way it looks on the Tegra. I could probably blame some of the quality on my method of install (using Zagg solution), but with the screen off the protector lays flat with few visible impurities. When turning the device on however, the blur and distortion of the protector is horrendous. Prior to installing it I had no problem reading text, post installation I have to hold the tablet a lot closer just to read text I was previously able to from my lap.<br /><br />I would not recommend, especially since I'm the second person (at least as far as reviewers go) to receive a box with no solution.",

The length of the stylus is what recommended it to me: I want a stylus that I can hold in my hand like a pen.  I used the OTHER kind of stylus -- the short, rubber-tipped kind -- when I had an iPad and I never could get used to the feel of the thing while drawing.  The Jot Pro definitely has a nicer feel and weight to it.<br /><br />The stylus works well against a bare screen -- it glides smoothly and precisely across the screen -- but after I installed my Zagg screen protector, the plastic disc at the tip would catch and stutter.  There's too much friction between the screen protector and the disc!  After considering the problem for a while, though, I stumbled on a low-tech solution to the problem: I took a small square of Scotch tape (the standard opaque kind, not the satin or high-gloss kind) and stuck it to the bottom side of the tip.  Voila!  The stylus glides right across the screen protector, just as smoothly as it did before.  I finally have a stylus that I can use to draw on my tablet!<br /><br />My only concern now is the twist-off cap, which can be something of a nuisance if you're in a hurry to jot down a quick note.  However, since I'm using the stylus primarily for longer drawing sessions, it isn't a huge issue.  I would definitely recommend this stylus to others as the best available.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Decent length and good weight; it's almost like holding a pen in your hand.<br />- Precise: unlike the shorter, rubber-tipped styli, the narrow tip on the Jot Pro makes it easy to see just where you're laying down those lines; important for detailed artwork<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Doesn't work well with Zagg screen protectors, unless you have Scotch tape handy<br />- The twist-off cap doesn't make for convenient note-taking",

So this keyboard case is a clamshell keyboard case which kind of makes the iPad mold into a sort of netbook design.  Inside the package: You get the keyboard case which is assembled as a single piece so there is no fixing or assembling required. You also get a charging cable which is a mini USB cable the sort you would charge android smartphones with which is to recharge the keyboard. The case mentions that the battery should last through 500 recharge cycles which in my estimate of using wireless iPad keyboard should exceed the life of the iPad itself because the battery on these keyboards last almost a month. You also get some literature describing how to connect/ pair the keyboard with the iPad. Also included are some promotional materials about the manufacturer.  Unboxing and pairing: The unboxing is pretty standard, like I mentioned no parts need assembly so its quite simple. The keyboard case comes with battery charge included, I'm not sure how much charge it already held but it did last me through more than an hour of typing until now and it still has charge in it. Pairing the iPad and the keyboard is pretty easy. Go to settings - Bluetooth on your ipad and after you turn it on you should be able to see the keyboard as 'Bluetooth keyboard' ready for pairing. If it doesn't appear press the pair button on the keyboard and voila! Its connected !  Build: As far as the build quality and such goes the whole case is pretty well built. I do have to confess that I don't do a lot of work on my ipad, its mostly used to watch videos or browse the internet, but this case has been wonderful even for that because of the multiple available viewing angles. There are two slots/stoppers to place the ipad in and there is an extendable neck in the back which would help adjust the viewing angle. The results is that there is an amazingly large number of configurations that you can place the iPad in for optimal viewing which in itself makes this case really nice.  All in all, its well worth the price and well built and I highly recommend it as a first case or even as a spare case for those who already have some sort of iPad case.",

There is nothing particular fancy about it; it simply works the way it is suppose to work, and works well.<br /><br />The design fits my hand perfectly and is quite comfortable.  The plug-in nano-receiver is quite small. I use this particular mouse on my lap top; the one I travel with and do my work on the job with.  The nano-receiver is plugged into the SBU port (I am currently using a Dell Inspiration which is several years old) and that is where it stays.  I need not worry about removing it constantly.  As the receiver is quite small, there is little to no chance of it being broken or accidently chipped off despite the fact that my lap top takes quite a beating.<br /><br />This mouse uses a single AA Battery.  I have been using this since last December 2009 pretty constantly and have had only one need for a battery change. I always carry a couple of extra AA Batteries with me as I despise using the computers touch pad for the type of work I do.<br /><br />The scroll function works quite well but if you are looking for the superfast scroll feature you need to look at another model.  I personally don't need or want that particular feature.  I have tried using this mouse on just about every surface you can imagine from desk top, to my leg, to the floor and everything between.  It always works and works smoothly<br /><br />Please do take note.  This is not a high tech mouse of the sort a serious gamer would be happy with.  I handle the ones my grandsons have on their computers and they are in a world of their own with adjustable weight, high speed this and that's  and to be quite frank, I am sort of afraid to touch the things for fear of having my hand either being evaporated or transported into another dimension.

The only problem was that we get very poor cell coverage where we stay, around 1 out of 5 bars, so the battery didn't last very long.  The modem would get hot after 20-30 minutes of usage, but I understand none of this was the fault of the router.

And I must say, after going through all the reviews on Amazon that say not to buy the Fire, I found them all to be totally incorrect.<br /><br />One of the repeating \\\\\"cons\\\\\" that I saw, was that the power button was on the bottom, making it very easy to accidentally turn off. I've never had this problem. I read, watch movies/tv shows, play games, write emails, go on Facebook, all the time on my Kindle, and I think you'd have to try REALLY hard to \\\\\"accidentally turn it off\\\\\".<br /><br />The next thing I saw was the Fire has a lack of privacy, with everything you just watched showing up on the Carousel. Well guess what, if you hold your finger down on any icon on your main menu/Carousel, there's an option to remove it from the Carousel. So there.<br /><br />Various reviews complained about the browser being slow.. but I say unless you're some computer geek with a really souped-up computer system, it's not slow at all. It's incredibly easy to type on the keyboard function, and web pages load pretty quickly. It's super easy to sync all your email accounts to the Kindle Fire, and the notifications let you know when you have new messages.<br /><br />I haven't been able to put my Fire down since I got it, I love everything about it, and encourage people to take poor reviews with a grain of salt, because most of them are misinformed or biased!",

I've bought cars for less.    Anyway, I get the replacement drive, and this one lasts all the way through all _520 CDs_ I own. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY CDS. I get them all stored on the drive, and I'm making a playlist up right before I move the songs all to my iPod...    ...and the new drive craps out.    Seriously. I wish this was a joke.     I don't know yet if the data is all gone this time, but I have had enough. If I get my music files off this heap by some miracle, I'm taking this drive out in my yard and I'm going to go \\\\\"Office Space\\\\\" on it. And then I'm going to take the little bits, and set them on fire. I got the iPod in March, and I have yet to listen to one lousy song on it. And it's all because of Seagate.

In the end, I broke some pins and had to replace it. Funfact: This is the ONLY brand-new FM1 socket-based processor that I could find on the Internet. However, that is not a bad thing. Looking at the pricing history for this APU, it really hasn't devalued in price whatsoever, so it shows that AMD still relies on this APU for their customers and while do like the idea of &#34;saving money&#34; (it may be listed at the &#34;original price&#34; of $150, but it was basically still the $100 price tag it already had since its release in 2012), regardless of the business' policy of the pricing, this APU is worh every penny I paid for it.<br /><br />Yes, its an older processor with only four cores (compared to my even OLDER AM3+ FX-8320, which has 8 cores), but just like my FX-Processor for my other desktop, this has the ability to be overlocked. I personally find this a nice option to have, especially when I'm on a deadline and I need to render a video for work. However, I won't be pushing the processor too much. With that being said, even with 4 GB of RAM (soon to be upgraded to of 8 GB Ballistix Tactical Series Memory w/ a GeForce GTX 750Ti), it really does add a bit more kick to my OEM's overall performance.<br /><br />I was told not to purchase this processing chip because it would be cheaper to buy a whole new computer than upgrade an old one (I beg to differ for me personally), but I am happy to say that I am not regretting that decision of this purchase.",

I did NOT purchase it to replace a proper laptop/desktop, and did not expect any high performance out of this device. Yes it will run autocad, inventor, photoshop, but you are way better off with a proper computer(unless your computer is ancient).<br /><br />From my 2 weeks of using this device, I found that the main bottleneck of this tablet's performance is still the CPU. Yes the new atom Z3740 increased performance dramatically compared to the last version, but it is by no means FAST. I found it constantly turbo boosting to 1.8Ghz, and running at ~30-40% usage when playing a simple youtube video.<br />I was amazed at the optimization of windows 8, initially I was very worried that the 2GB of RAM will simply not cut it, as I have 16GB in my desktop and 8GB in my laptop, and I'm constantly using up 4-5GB of the RAM when not doing much. But windows 8.1 amazed me, the RAM usage stayed at 0.9GB while idling, and I have never seen it above 1.7GB other than when I was installing new software or opening multiple applications. And even then the tablet does not feel &#34;laggy&#34;, if there are any, it's from the CPU, which you will be finding is running at 100% usage. The RAM optimization is definitely better than windows 7, and miles ahead of XP and vista if anyone still uses those legacy OS...<br />The internal storage is small, but I have about 32GB ish left after I installed my software that I will be using on this machine, which is not much. It is not fast, it is not a SSD, it's the same storage device found inside your typical tablet and smartphone. The read speed is fairly normal compared to a 7200rpm HDD, the write speed is extremely low. But you probably won't be installing stuff all day on this tablet so I don't think that will be too big of an issue.  Looks like I will not be putting in a microSD, as the space left is more than enough to store my pdf, ppt, excel, and word documents, but you do have the choice of adding another 64GB.<br />I got about 5 days on a single charge of mainly standby, with occasional screen on time, at the end of the 5th day, i was at 27% charge. When I tried to use it for real, I got nearly 16 hours of battery life for word processing, this was way better than what I hoped. For mixed usage, Asus's estimate is about right, I got about 10-11 hours, and for watching video file with an external HDD connected, I got about 6 hours. This definitely gets the same if not more battery life than my Asus Tf300 which runs android 4.2.1., and yet this one runs a full blown x86 system. Intel's new atom bay-trail CPU might not be a performer, but the power draw is just amazingly low.<br />Never tried to play games on it, and is not planning to do so, as this is not supposed to be used as a computer replacement anyway, just a way more useful tablet/notebook than ipad or android tablets at a fraction of the cost. I paid $379+tax for my device, and I think the current amazon price by sellers are just too high.<br /><br />Haven't seen any quality issues with my unit, some earlier batches may have issues. But if yours is manufactured in the later half of Dec 2013, you should be good.<br />I can see how keyboard could be an issue for people who have large hands, or fingers rather, my hand size is considered average in males, and I do not find it very hard to get used to typing on it. In fact I typed this review on this device.<br />My main complaints about this device is the very small right shift key..I keep hitting the up arrow when I want to hit the right shift key, for quotation marks, question marks etc.. they could've made the arrow key more compact and made the shift bigger.<br />Also the keyboard and touchpad makes a lot of noise compared to my laptop. The touchpad mouse keys are especially bad, I try to avoid using the keys unless I have to right click something...but you can always use your fingers. Won't reduce a star because of it, simply because of the price point, if this was a more premium device, it would be a different story. There is also no backlit for the keyboard, but I don't look at the keyboard when I'm typing anyway, plus at sub$400 what can you expect?<br /><br />If you are an elderly person, or one with very bad eyesights, the fonts/icons/menus WILL BE SMALL. The DPI is pretty high on this tablet. So be aware of that before you purchase. It's not an issue if you use metro apps, but will be an issue if you want to work in desktop mode. I found the size to be fine for me, as I like smaller fonts/icons anyway to allow me to see more, when I showed it to my mother however, she claimed that it's &#34;tiny&#34; and it make her eyes hurt. The font sizes can be adjusted in the settings in windows 8 based on your preference, but even then she still says it's small for viewing in desktop mode.",

The doors snap in and secure the drives perfectly. The lights will indicate if one drive is not seated correctly. The doors also lock with a small key. The fan will help with thermals on the drives. The USB 3 root cable is plenty long and was ideal for me to put it in a rear port on my desktop. The power cable is a brick and those cables are plenty long as well.<br /><br />The power button being placed where it is a HUGE plus for me, in that I can turn the box off and turn the drives off when I want to.

Look at the reviews for any three HP models.  What you are likely to find is that a significant minority of buyers have had major problems with their purchases. For a more comprehensive analysis look at SquareTrade, the company that provides warranties for Amazon.  It rates HP  last in reliability for the eight major brands it rates.  HP computers have a 25 percent failure rate within three years, worse than Dell, Acer and Gateway. (ASUS and Toshiba have the best ratings)  No major company should allow a such failure rate on their products. As consumers we should insist they do better before we buy their products.",

I use multiple USB condenser microphones for podcasting (a Blue Yeti Pro and a Blue Snowball) through this hub into a MacBook Pro, and whereas my previous hub would often freak out/make terrible noises/disconnect the mics at random, this one has been rock solid for several weeks and multiple shows now.

While the reviews were a bit mixed, I went with the Logitech Bluetooth Audio Adapter to let her push her music to our speakers.  So far it has worked much better than I expected.  The sound is a little muddy/muted compared to music connected  directly through the speakers but it is certainly much better than the smartphone (Galaxy S Blaze) and netbook (Asus PCee) speakers.<br /><br />I figured it would stream perfectly near the speakers and in direct line of sight, but I've been able to walk just about all over our first floor (a good 30-40 feet) with intervening walls (but with open hallways around) and the music played just fine. It did help to reboot her smartphone as that cleaned up some initial choppiness that occurred when we first tried it out.<br /><br />I downloaded the HP driver another reviewer recommended (google sp44774.exe) and the driver installed OK on the Asus windows 7 netbook. I also installed a small application on the netbook called switcher (there are others google windows audio switcher) that let her *easily* switch the audio output from the netbook speakers to the bluetooth adapter and back with two clicks.<br /><br />Now I'm tempted to get a few more of these and connect them to anything with a speaker so everyone can use existing speakers around the house to play music from their phones/laptops.  This helped make my existing livingroom Panasonic stereo system, bought in 1989, useful again by playing music from more sources.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Playback was fairly muddy, to the point I decided maybe I should try wifi/dlna.  Checking my connections I had attached the adapter to the phono input of my stereo amp.  I changed it over to the aux/video input instead and the sound cleaned up completely.  I do recall something about phono inputs sometimes having extra circuitry just for record players and so that might have been it.  It is almost crystal clear now.It is almost crystal clear now.",

We had 6 of these Lenovos at work, and our, since we build USB devices we quickly discovered the Lenovos were slightly off the USB spec in several ways. This made me cut the hub some slack, even though my USB devices did work better when attached directly to the Lenovo.   A few weeks ago the Lenovo died and I replaced it with an Asus. To my annoyance, both my hubs still go dead. I'm off to the store now to try some other brand.  Except for the dying thing these hubs are not bad. The purple light is pretty with the silver finish, and the price was OK. The Power brick is quite weak - trying to charge my phone takes 3x longer on the hub than with the phone's charger. I would not try to run a USB hard drive through this hub.   I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because both hubs are still (almost) working after 2 years.

I haven't decided if it is worth putting up with the annoyance as it is $30 cheaper than a Kindle touch without the offers.  I understand that I can opt out of the Screensavers and that Amazon will kindly charge me $30 dollars.  3rd complaint is that the text to speech feature is poor as the computer generated voice frequently mispronounces words and doesn't seem to know much about punctuation.  My final complaint is about the audio books.  They are very expensive and do not allow you to follow along with the story as it is being read.

Some folks have said they were not thrilled with the limited opening of the screen, but the screen opens 120+ degrees, which is as far as I opened my screen even before the Speck was put on.  The temperature issue may be problem in the long term, but the plastic will certainly do some level of conduction (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars), but my thought is that it's worth protecting this very expensive laptop.  I'd highly recommend these cases.  By the way, for those who are 'into' the Mac look (brushed aluminum), the clear case doesn't get in the way of the beauty of the machine at all.",

I am not that good with computerized things, but i try, between the device and the cloud and then the collection and the book list its not easy going back and forth. Then I found where to remove items from the device, I thought I was removing them(since they where in the collection)here I was just moving them to the front of the list. Uggg!

It's the fastest drive I've ever owned and I don't think I will ever be able to go back to traditional harddrive as my boot drive.   Physical installation was painless and easy, as expected from a modern drive of this form factor.  I use this drive as primary boot drive that holds my operating system (Windows 7/64bit) along with a select games and software such as Visual Studio and the performance improvement is very very noticeable. The most noticeable benefit so far has been moving my  Star Wars: The Old Republic Beta installation to this drive. The results have been nothing short of amazing, with load times for changing planets as well as the occasional texture pop all but disappearing.   There's however a regrettable flaw with this drive:  Out of the box and even after updating it's firmware, my computer would hang and shortly thereafter crash about once per day, always during a write operation to the drive. The computer's BIOS would forget it's bootorder afterwards and require manual configuration to resurrect. Data was lost and corrupted during these crashes.  This is a serious issue and a bit of sleuthing on the internet confirms that it is relatively widespread. OCZ has not been forthcoming with support or even acknowledged the presence of the problem. While the presence of such a critical flaw should cause the product to be rated 1/5, the fact that I was able to find a solution for the problem (a registry modification to change certain settings for intel based storage controllers usually found in sandy-bridge mainboards) leads me to a 4/5 rating. The dramatically improved responsiveness of my computer alone makes me forgive and forget the significant time and headache this bug caused me until I found the solution.",

After opening the box and charging the 1005hab for the specified time in the manual,I was finally ready to fire it up. 1st, the case is a magnet for fingerprints, but overall fit and finish seems nice. Startup and seting up the netbook for first use was very easy, no more than 20 minutes and I was already connected to my network in my home. Wireless is great,built in n speeds was nice for a $300 netbook, My router is in my basement and I can get 75% strength on the 1st floor at the other end of the house, 2nd floor has ok signal so overall very good. The touch pad for me is not the greatest, just trying to move the pointer around with it sometimes goes into a scrolling effect rather than the mouse moving, and the left anf right buttons don't always seem to register every click. Got a bluetooth mouse and solved those issues. Keyboard took a little getting used to due to the size, also the size of the screen makes viewing some documents and web pages tough, I have to be wearing my glasses to see the screen clearly, i use a 22\\\\\" monitor on my home computer so i can get away with no glasses with that, not the netbook though. But then if I wanted something that was big and easy to read, i would have bought a full size laptop. Hard drive storage is good at 140ish GB free out of the box. Lets talk battery... where did they get 4+ hours of life from this thing? I haven't timed it out to see for sure but it's more like 2-3 hours depending on what your doing with it. it may stretch out to 3.5 before shutting down from low power but i just charge it before that anyway. Students couldn't get through a school day on a single charge. The processor power is good for what it is. I use it for mostly internet and I design and maintain a few websites with macromedia software, so its great to bring with me when going to meet up with people to talk sites. Fits inside my motorcycle side case with ease. I also bought a 2GB memory chip but saw very little diffence with it. If your running that many memory hogging programs that you really need to upgrade the netbook, you probably should have bought a fullsize laptop with a faster processor. changing the chip was very easy though, 1 screw and a little cover on the bottom comes right off.  Overall if you want a compact, easy to use computer to take with you for email, word documents and some picture editing software, or just to browse the internet, I'd say this is for you, if your going to be editing video or mutlitasking larger programs, you might want to think laptop",

I would echo what other reviewers have said regarding the quality of this product - overall, for the price it does a very good job of recording high-quality video, and I see little to no delay on real-time HDMI on the TV. The software is simple to use, although for my purposes a bit TOO simple, as it is basically a trim and capture software, although if you have another video editor suite this is of little concern (I use Premier) and it is very reliable.<br /><br />However, this comes with one caveat: IF the device that is powering the HDMI is disconnected or the USB is disconnected during capture, any previous video that was recorded is lost and as far as I know there is no way to recover. I had this occur when my cat rubbed against the front of my 360 slim (due to the touch button, it powered down) I had approximately four hours of video at that time that I was recording through. When it was off I noticed I couldn't hit stop on the recording, and once I powered it back on it allowed me to hit stop, however when I looked at the video it was just the 9 second clip  from it powering on. Prior to powering it back on I noticed I had approximately 300 GB free on my HDD, upon powering on and stopping the recording it instantly went to 320 GB free.<br /><br />So not only did it not record the previous video in transcoding it, but it also automatically deleted the raw file so I had no way of getting it back. This would not be that big of a deal even if it wasn't transcoded (if it at least left the raw file so I could attempt to salvage any video that was in there) but it is a fairly major flaw for an otherwise great product. I have no idea why it would delete the raw file, this doesn't seem necessary at all, and to me seems like a pretty major issue with the software. I could also not find this information listed in any documentation elsewhere regarding this product. In the futureI'll know if something similar happens to go in and relocate the raw video file so the software cannot delete it after I stop the recording, but its unfortunate to lose such a big chunk of recordings, especially if there is a lot of unique captures that are nearly impossible to reproduce on it.",

No need to get out your laptops travel power adapter. Not so with the USB3.0 based docks. The USB3.0 docks require you to plug in the USB cord, get out your travel laptop adapter, plug it into the wall and your laptop, physically open your laptop to turn it on, turn on the USB3.0 dock and wait for it to boot up before you can see anything on the monitors. Then when you try to use the computer the mouse performance is jumpy. Forget plugging the mouse directly into the computer, that doesn't fix the problem.

All in all, if you're looking for web browsing, streaming netflix, a computer for your iTunes library and some basic photo editing with Picasa then this is a pretty darn good computer for the value.

Much above that price and you should probably look elsewhere.    As others have said, the display is excellent - very bright.  The keyboard is OK - not great, a bit \\\\\"spongy\\\\\" but not bad.  The speakers are awful, perhaps the worst I've ever heard; attaching a pair of cheap USB-powered speakers makes a big difference when you use it at home.    The CPU is a standard 2.2GHZ Pentium (Dual Core) T4400, which is a sweet budget CPU (a budget version of the now-being-phased-out Core 2 Duo CPU).  It's actually quite a fast CPU for basic stuff. The thing DOES NOT get hot (compare that to the AMD-based laptops) beyond a little warm on the bottom.      The two biggest downsides (beyond the speakers): only two USB ports and no webcam (even the Acer version of this laptop that has a webcam curiously has no built-in microphone).  So as I said, for the price I paid, I can put up with it.    One little annoyance I've noticed lately:  The touchpad is a bit wider than I'm used to, and I seem to rub the left side of the touchpad with my left hand too often, causing the mouse pointer to jump.  This seems like a curious design feature of this particular model; when typing on other 15.6\\\\\" laptops of this same era, I don't have this problem.    RAM is DDR3 despite what official specs say.  Easy to upgrade.  The wireless card is easy to upgrade as well - you can upgrade it to an Intel 5100 \\\\\"Draft-N\\\\\" card that is an excellent wireless card for $10-$15 on ebay, very worth doing. You can use either a half-height or full-height mini-PCI wireless card in the slot, I've used both.  SATA hard drive is easy to swap as well - I've already done that.    You can run XP on this thing too if you really want to - but you must first upgrade the BIOS to at least 3.06 (so you have to boot up Windows 7 for that most likely).  Then you have to set the BIOS SATA option to\\\\\"IDE\\\\\" not \\\\\"AHCI\\\\\" and then XP can boot easily (you'll need drivers from Acer on the Emachines support page for this laptop).  I did have trouble with Acer's supplied XP driver for the included Broadcom wireless card - it froze the laptop every time I enabled the card, but as I have since replaced the Broadcom card with an Intel card, I have no problems with wireless in either Windows 7 or XP.",

I did a cursory web search and found this was caused by the reading head sticking. I followed some online advice and attempted to download the latest firmware from Seagate only to find that no new firmware was available, as of my writing this review.  Furthermore, I've noticed that the drive is not always fully accessible in my Mac's Finder.  I'll be doing my research and replacing this with a better drive, probably Western Digital.  Note: I have a WD drive hooked up to the Mini for the Time Machine backup and it works flawlessly and NO chirping!  I only bought the Seagate over WD due to it being the available drive meeting my basic requirements at my local Best Buy at the time.  I'll be ordering a WD (or something else, perhaps) this time, and through Amazon.",

Having the front and rear cameras is nice when you want to have a video chat or take a quick pic of something to Google Goggle. Bluetooth works really well for tethering and uses a lot less power than WiFi tethering on both the devices involved. The TV remote app is a good idea but does not work with all devices and cannot be used like a plain old universal remote (you are locked in to using it as a guide). As usual Touchwiz and all the other Samsung crapware ruins the device and slows it down. It also has a proprietary iPod like connector instead of the a standard micro USB connector like the majority of other devices in the world. Samsung if you insist on including a useless dock connector at least add a micro USB connector as well. I will probably end up selling this tablet and getting a Google Nexus 7\\\\\" tablet if/when they release one so I don't have crappy software customization and get updates in a reasonable amount of time.",

I shopped around and looked at all the stats; speeds, weight, memory, etc, etc, and I finally settled on the Acer A500, and I haven't regretted it.  I am SO glad I got this. I got the 16g and bought the 16g sd card to go with it.  It has not let me down.  It may not be as fast as the Ipad or a few of the other tablets out there, but, it's functional, durable, speed is acceptable, ease of use is outstanding.  Both cameras work very well, and I haven't had any problems with the wi-fi usage.  The battery can last me a whole day, sometimes, it charges very quickly, and streaming Netflix is not a problem as long as there's a good signal.  I really liked the USB and SD card ports.  Downloading was a breeze, but, you will have to get a file manager app to move your media from the internal drive to the SD card/flash dive and vice versa.<br />  On the downside, it is a bit heavier than the other tablets.  It's also a bit thicker...not as slender as the Ipad, so, there's some weight.  also, there aren't too many protective covers or accessories out there for it (or there weren't when I first got it).  I started experiencing problems with the picture turning off, then quickly coming back on, but, I DO lend the tablet to my teenage son, whom I'm sure have have dropped it a few times (and the 1 or 2 times I've done that as well), so I attribute that to my clumsiness, not to a bad product.<br />  Overall, I'm very happy with the Acer A500.  And because of this tablet, I'm looking for an Acer Laptop as well.  I rated this 4 stars.  I would of given it 5, but, deducted the 1 star because of weight.

Avoiding products with bad ratings has worked well for me in the past, but this router was an exception to the rule. I bought it because it had decent reviews and was independently ranked well by PC magazine etc.<br /><br />However, in my 20 years of experience dealing with many networking products at home, IT industry, and at the University where I teach and manage networks, this router is definitely the worst networking product I have come across. Here are few of the issues (and upgrading firmware does not help):<br /><br />1. The first and foremost the router does not streamline connections to the internet via a broadband cable modem. It took odd combinations of power cycling and cable-modem resets to get it to finally connect. Note that I was using static  IP and consequently even DHCP negotiations etc. don't apply and my observations suggest a basic protocol implementation errors in the router as 3 other routers work just fine without any issues.  So connecting to the internet is an issue -- so what else is the router going to be god for?<br /><br />2. The wireless access point did not correctly start-up. The configuration and setup is sufficiently cumbersome and non-intuitive. Nevertheless persevering with it was futile and the wireless when it turned on was fleeting and flaky at best.<br /><br />3. To top it all, the overall user experience for this router is terribly slow. Just accessing the built-in introductory page takes a solid 15-20 seconds. When each mouse click takes 15-20 seconds, in today's world that is practically eternity. This product claims to have a 1 MHz processor and it does not add up at all given that the system was responding as if it was running on a 1Khz processor. I have need better results from a 133 MHz Pentium II<br /><br />4. The form factor of this router is ungainly, big, and does not fit into networking enclosures.<br /><br />5. Not that you would be dealing with the setup and UI often, but the few times you have to deal with it, it is rather painful. It almost feels like the different parts were thrown in in an haphazard manner without streamlining the system as a whole.<br /><br />Overall I discourage users from investing into this router.networking enclosures.<br /><br />5.

I've been reading books through the Kindle app on my iPad for about a year now and I do love that. I think it has spoiled me.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle Paperwhite for a few reasons:<br />1. the iPad can be heavy; the Kindle, of course is very light weight, especially in comparison<br />2. I wanted something I would be more comfortable taking on public transit when I just want to read (the Kindle will be less attractive to thieves - I THINK, plus it's very portable and can fit nicely in my purse)<br />3. I wanted to be able to &#34;borrow&#34; books from Amazon via the Kindle; the app doesn't allow for that.<br /><br />So in regard to all those reasons I bought the Paperwhite, I believe I got what I was looking for.<br /><br />But... I just find the device itself is a tad too small for me to hold it comfortably. I could probably fix that with a case, but then it wouldn't fit so easily in my purse...<br /><br />Mainly, though, it comes down to functionality. I find the Paperwhite a bit awkward and clumsy; the touch screen seems kind of clunky and slow. I have seen the Kindle Fire (first generation) in action. It's quite nice to navigate. I borrowed a first generation Kindle to read a book on. It was okay, not great. I was hoping the Paperwhite would be closer to the Fire in operation (because of the touch screen) than to the original reader. It's not.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I bought it and I will definitely use it, but I'm not in love with it as so many other people seem to be.

However, I noticed a distinct pattern as to when the router was dropping the connection.  It only happened in the evenings when my husband was home. (He travels and when he was gone for a week no problem.)  Then I realized this started happening when he got his new PDA which connects to our wireless router.  When he brought the PDA home and it was off there was no problems.  The same problem occurs when he brings his work laptop home.  The problem does not occur when he connects to the wireless router but as soon as he disconnects either the PDA or work laptop then I can not connect with our home laptop computer.  To correct the situation I have to unplug and replug the router in.  We have the mac addresses for the PDA and his work computer configured in the wireless router and the problem continued.  After turning the broadcast off the problem has stopped occuring when he uses his PDA or work laptop. While the router still drops connections occasionally it is not as bad as it use to be.  I would say it drops about once every 2-3 weeks and there is no pattern now. Sometimes it occurs during the day and sometimes at night.  Hope this helps someone who may be having the same problem.  Maybe we can figure out a way to correct this.",

This Netgear is more boxy than the rounded Airport Express. Also, the picture with the hand holding it made it look smaller than it actually is.<br /><br />First, some advantages over the Airport Express. This Netgear can be powered via USB, which can be convenient during travel. Also, it has two ethernet ports (vs only one on the previous gen Airport Express), and the WAN ethernet port can become a LAN port, depending on the setup. iOS app is decent, and has a great feature in monitoring bandwidth usage. Really flexible setup, and can be used to share an existing wireless connection to wireless.<br /><br />Minuses: it supports only 2.4GHz 802.11n. No 5GHz. No gigabit ethernet. Power slider is tiny can can be switched accidentally. Also, I find that the unit can get confused if I switch from wired to wireless mode (and vice versa) without turning it off first (the Airport Express doesn't even have a power switch). I am used to the Apple Airport Express setup, thus setting up this Netgear via a browser is really confusing at first. Device can be unstable at times. Connectivity is usually great, but there are random times where my wifi devices suddenly can't recognize the router momentarily.<br /><br />I think Apple's Airport Express is still the gold standard, but it is unfortunate that Apple decided to go with a different design on the latest one. This Netgear is great for traveling and in a pinch, but I would not rely on it as a main full time router. I would get at least a dual-band router for home use.",

The only reason not a 5 star is that on occasion, when restoring the computer, the indicator lights glow on the active ports on the Hub but go out on one or two after a few seconds. This indicates that the unit attached to that port is no longer active. If I unplug the hub from the computer and reattach its fine and all external components are operative.

Like everyone who's gone through this, my original battery was great, but died and I didn't feel like paying $120 for a new battery for my backup to my backup PC...so I decided to try Anker. As per Amazon standards, it arrived on time in perfect condition. I was pretty surprised it had a 76% charge, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Different batteries (depending on capacitor and other factors) have different best practices, so I always like to follow manufacturer instructions for charges. This time was no different and I followed them to a T. When I finally booted up, I was again surprised - I don't even remember my original Lenovo battery holding a charge the way the Anker does. Btw, I keep the auto-dim feature on but other settings remain the same in full feature mode. I went through some basic tests that my backup PC does: you know, surfing youtube while watching TV, playing music while vacuuming for a couple hours, the usual. All did great and battery was/is out-STAN-ding at holding it's charge in performance and standby.<br /><br />Here's the down side, and it's pretty fundamental and significant: if you move your laptop the wrong way, the connection of the PC to the battery is lost. Yep, you know what that means. In fact, last night I was using it for about 2 hours streaming...no problem...I put the laptop back in its spot and plugged it in. No problems. Closed the top. Still no problems. Went to open the top this morning and junst (jeunst...sp?) it in I guess what was the wrong way aaand...all systems down. Booted up once opened and it was fine, but the charge was only at 58%, so it must have died somewhere last night...not really sure what's up with that.<br /><br />So what have I learned? You get what you pay for? Ehhh...nah, it's still a good product. The shame is the true fit design. It's a backup.... I'm ok with having to leave the top up, or at least not fully closed...maybe take some extra precautions when doing certain things. I don't do much development or create any new files on this PC without sending to a neutral zone, but I don't think I'll ever get rid of my XP. You understand. Would I purchase again? - yes. Would I recommend to someone else who didn't have 5 PCs? - no.",

It does feel plastic-y and cheap.<br />2- The Bluetooth response seems to get some interference from the Wifi radio.  There's a slight delay, and an annoying repetition of keystrokes when Wifi is turned on.  With two taps though, I turn Wifi off on my iPad, and everything works great.<br />3-  I use a Microsoft Natural Keyboard.  It works, however, the CTRL key doesn't seem to work with my iPad, which I suspect has more to do with the iOS than it does this device.

I noticed these as soon as I used the mouse for the first time and checked for obstructions on the sensor, tried different surfaces, tweaked software settings, and since it was used on a laptop the mouse was inches away from the USB dongle eliminating any possible signal issues.<br /><br />I eventually discovered why the mouse was acting so weird, a design flaw that I can't do anything about. Unlike nearly every mouse you've used over the years where the sensor is in the very center of the mouse, the M705 sensor is placed on the far right edge of the mouse, near where your pinky finger rests. The result is that many slight mouse and wrist rotations that other mouses would not act on are instead exaggerated as mouse movement.<br /><br />Any mouse movement you make with your wrist that rotates the mouse even a little will result in different behavior than what you're used to, especially in horizontal and slightly angled lines. Even habits you may have picked up such as slightly lifting the mouse to the side to reposition it on your desk will work differently. No amount of tweaks will fix this, you will need to re-learn your mouse behaviors or this mouse will always feel strange.<br /><br />Otherwise, this mouse is well built and feels solid but this is the only Logitech product I've ever regretted purchasing and I can't recommend it.",

Regardless, this drawback is tolerable, as it subsides in a few days - and the overall look is rather nice.  So overall, this is a great accessory... BUT PLEASE NOTE:  The corner of the flap inside of the cover (not entirely sure what the flap's intended purpose is) creates a minor protrusion in the center of that surface, such that if you close the cover, it will make contact with the center of the Kindle Touch's screen... and will inadvertently trigger whatever action is currently presented on the display at that time.  As a result, I have made two accidental purchases of Kindle books; the \\\\\"Buy this Book Now\\\\\" option/button is EXACTLY aligned with where this flap contacts the screen.  If you have a book sample on your home screen, and close your Kindle Touch without turning it off (something I no longer do), that very \\\\\"buy\\\\\" menu is immediately pulled up... and if you so much as graze the cover after closing it (easy to do if you're stowing your Kindle Touch in a bag, etc.), the flap will go ahead purchase that particular book for you.  Not ideal - but neither is the fact that you can't deactivate 1-Click purchasing on any Kindle device - but I digress...  Of course, there are obvious work-arounds in avoiding this (placing book samples into \\\\\"collections\\\\\" folders, making sure to turn off the Kindle Touch before closing the cover, or even cut off the flap entirely), but I'm currently out $50 for a couple of days until Amazon gets around to refunding these accidental purchases.

USB 3.0 is part of why this drive is a speed demon, but it is also backwards compatible with USB 2.0 ports (although you won't see the 3.0 speeds.)<br /><br />Another big reason this drive is so speedy is that it is really two 2.5\\\\\" Samsung 2TB SATA drives that are in a RAID-0 configuration. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive (Independent) Disks. There are several RAID levels, which refers to how the data is distributed between the drives. This is RAID-0, which is optimized for speed with no mirroring or parity (no redundancy.)<br /><br />So what does that mean to the user? It means you will get very fast data transfer speeds but if either of the drives should fail, you will lose all of your data since data is written simultaneously onto both of the drives. So does that mean RAID-0 is bad? Nope. It just means that this should not be your primary back up drive and that data written to this drive should be backed up regularly to guard against data loss in the even of a drive failure.<br /><br />The drive itself is surprisingly small and without the need for an a/c power adapter, it's highly portable. The top of the drive is a matte finish aluminum and the sides and base are a matte finish plastic. It ships with two USB cables. One is a Y cable for laptops and computers that can't power the drive via one USB port so you can plug it into two USB ports.<br /><br />It comes with Seagate Dashboard software pre-installed on the drive, but can use your preferred back up software instead. I like the Seagate back up software fine but I'm not especially enamored with the social media applications.<br /><br />So I've loaded mine with movies and family videos (that are all safely backed up) we can watch on the television and it works great for that. I was very gratified to see how quickly I was able to write all that data but I did notice this drive got very hot during the process. You won't want this thing sitting in your lap while it's working. ;-)<br /><br />The drive is really, really quiet and I had to glance at the slow blinking white LED on top several times to reassure myself it was still busily writing.<br /><br />As a side note, it is interesting to me that the 2TB drives inside can be installed in a PlayStation 4 gaming console to double the storage.

(I waited until after the Antec died because the Targus branded cooler was more expensive).    Amazon has a great price on both the Antec and the Targus, $12.  When I needed the cooler (in college, usually on an emergency basis), I had to rush out to Best Buy and sink $25-30 for the Antec or $40-50 for the Targus.  So you can see why $12 is a bargain to me.    The Antec and the Targus both have a life expectancy of one year (in my experience... if you get a dud, it can be less...)  FYI Targus has a good warranty and will be helpful in making an exchange of your dud for a working cooler.    If you've already sunk your money in a craptascular laptop, then a cooler might be a good idea.  If you haven't purchased your laptop yet, you might consider buying a laptop without an overheating problem.  Or at least don't buy your laptop from Circuit City.",

It is still all the limitations of an amazon tablet vs a regular tablet -- including the REALLY annoying aspect of going through the internet to use youtube when obviously an app would be a lot easier and less temper-tantrum-throwing on amazon's part. It also feels a bit cheap--plastic-y and a bit of bulk and girth for being so hollow seeming inside. It has some bugs--it tends to freeze up quickly, and it tends to get really confused during high-demand apps like netflix and I've had to power it down and restart it a couple times already because of this issue. I have to completely get out of the program before turning the screen off to fix this.<br /><br />But for $100, it has a lot of memory and space, it saved the day when I needed something else with internet access when the wireless card on my laptop went out, and I use amazon frequently since I have prime so I have access to the shows, and the music, and all of that jazz. I also like having it small enough to shove in my purse or bag to take with me. I do want a bigger tablet eventually, but this is perfect for pulling up a recipe I need to cook with from online, or plugging into the stereo to play music while I do things around the house. It's a great little tablet, if you can get over the amazon-only limitations. A lot of people can't, which is understandable.... but hey, I have a smart phone, and a laptop, and between those two things I can deal with it. Also it DOES support netflix, which is the other really big thing I use it for.<br /><br />Having prime? I think for $100 this tablet is worth it. I would NOT have paid $159 for this tablet, but I thought the $100 price tag was fair.",

(150$ish)<br /><br />The Bad<br />I would rate the mac as a 4 star simply because not all the software I need is available to Mac's. Purchasing Parellels to run Windows fixes the problem, but that's just another added cost to the already high price. Also, it is a pain to sync up a Droid phone because Mountain Lion isn't compatible with the Droid software yet.<br /><br />The Good<br />The good news is the resale value is so high. You can spend $1,300 on a mac, and 3 years later still get 700+. A windows version will set you back $800 or so, and constantly have to be updated, and the value after 3 years will be 300$ if your lucky. This means a great deal to me as a college student, because I want something that will last a few years, but one that will also have a high resale value. Apple software in general is much easier to use than Windows also, so it is more user friendly.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend Mac's to college students.

All the YouTube videos make it look very easy, but this is a tricky machine to master.<br />First, it is useful to note that the tablet comes with a leather case that holds the stylus in the hinge. It would be great if the case had a fold to prop it up. Any other case that I have found that fits this tablet does not have a place to store the stylus.<br />I really bought this slate to take to meetings to take notes in Microsoft Onenote. I want it to work with handwriting with the stylus. It works very well to just write the notes on the slate. The small tip stylus is just like writing with a pen. Ink to text works reasonably well, but it is very far from perfect.<br />Drawing is much more difficult. I am a contractor, and I hoped that sketching would be easier and more flexible.<br />The stylus affects the screen by just hovering, so you can suddenly find yourself typing endless aaaaaaaa (I found a setting to change that), or closing a window, or opening another program.<br />Panning and zooming with fingers is not near as smooth as some android tablets I have seen. They say that in automatic mode that you can just tap twice with your finger, and then it will recognize fingers for pan and zoom, but the truth is that this is sporadic at best. There are supposed to be \\\\\"flicks\\\\\" that you can be program to do whatever you want, but getting that to work is a large challenge too.<br />It did lock up on me once, and it wanted to restore to an earlier restore point. I could not find how to manipulate the options when the computer was in it's pre-windows state. Luckily, I had a wireless mouse and I was able to plug the receiver into the USB slot. That solved that problem, but I could not find a way to do a hard reboot.<br /><br />Ultimately, you might want to install Windows 8, but the natural screen resolution is too small to run most of the apps that come with W8.<br />All in all, I would say that they did not quite get the software right for my intended use. I still believe that with practice, I will get better at using it, but it is not as easy as HP would like you to believe.",

Sometimes a new product would be shipped in bulk, (which is why two day shipping or even one day shipping doesn't mean anything here), which means they won't ship your product until they meet a certain # of sells. This would mean that the bulk is shipped to the US, and then there must be a separate packaging. So somewhere along that line, someone stole the product.<br /><br />I have ordered a new one from WASD, and though Amazon claimed it 1 day shipping for me, as they do when an item goes missing, the expected date is 5 days from now.

I was so excited to get this tablet when I looked at it online. I looked perfect for what I wanted. I have an iPad 2 which I absulutely love, however I wanted a smaller tablet for better portability. The price was great and for what I need the 8GB storage was fine. Has a sd card slot so that seemed great too. Kickstand seemed like a nice extra feature. Has a lot of great features that others mentioned in their reviews and that other 7 inch tablets on the market don't have. As I said really excited to get this tablet. It came in two days and that is where my troubles started. I plugged it in to charge and waited for the light to start blinking like the quick start guide said. After 14 hours it never happened. So I figured that the tablet must be charged by now and turned it on. It came up on a screen which I now know to be the lock screen. After many frustrating minutes I finally figured out how to get past that screen. It took me to the home page. It never went into a setup walk thru so I could put my wifi network into it. I found that walk thru finally and forced it to run where I configured the settings. So after much frustration I tried to register the product thru their app as was stated in the quick start guide. It would never connect to their servers. I tried to update the firmware thinking that was it. Again no luck. Wouldn't connect. I tried the browser and again nothing. No web pages would load. Tried to connect to the android market and create a new account. Nothing. After 3 days of trying everything I could think of to get this tablet working I contacted tech support. I received an email stating that I would be contacted in 2 business days. That's been 5 business days ago and still no response. I found this tablet to be EXTREMELY slow when even trying to load web pages before telling me that the page didn't exist. Also the battery didn't seem to hold a charge for very long as another reviewer stated. In summary I have a paperweight that is going to be returned to Best Buy. I will never buy an Archos again.

The feature that puts the iPad to sleep when you close the case has worked just fine for me--no issues, and I generally carry the iPad in my backpack with textbooks around campus.  The iPad does tend to fall out of the lowest slot for the stand, but I haven't had any problems with the two slots closest to the iPad.<br /><br />Overall, a good quality case for the price.

My Canon SL1 has code built right into the firmware to recognize the card and the card can connect to my home network for transfering my pics to my home PC as well as my and my wife's phone.<br /><br />Sounds good so far... until you try to use it.<br /><br />1) The first thing I noticed was when transfering something, sometimes the transfer would be blazing and finish fast, the next one(keep in mind, I am sitting right next to my router or if going to the phone, right next to the phone) would be slow as molasses or be quick for a few seconds then STOP, then pick up slowly and eventually finish. Not consistent at all.<br /><br />2) Second, if I transfer something to my PC, then I can no longer send it to my phone. If I send it to my phone, I can no longer send to to my wife's phone and if I wanted to send it to my PC, I'd have to have my PHONE do the transfer of its copy of the pictures because the card wouldn't allow a photo to be transfered twice, to anywhere. Once the card sent the photo somewhere, that was it. The card would not send it anywhere else, period. Terrible implementation.<br /><br />3) When I shoot, I have the camera create a JPG and RAW files for each photo. The issue is, the eye-fi treats the files as one. So if I send it to my phone, I get forced to take BOTH the JPG AND RAW file. I don't want to wait for the RAW file on my phone, I don't need it there.<br /><br />The basic problem with this card is it only PUSHES things FROM the card and doesn't give you the ability to PULL something from it(other than putting in a card reader). So when the card connects wirelessly to either a PC or Phone, it will push whatever \\\\\"new\\\\\"(aka never been transfered anywhere) photos are marked as \\\\\"Protected\\\\\" (assuming you use the selective transfer or all new photos, if you aren't using that mode). Since cameras mark the photo in general as \\\\\"protected\\\\\" and not have the ability to mark just either the JPG version and/or the RAW version, the card pushes both.<br /><br />Eye-fi needs to get with the times and allow their Phone app and PC app to be able to wirelessly PULL from the card, like the Transcend and EZ Share cards allow for.<br /><br />The push on this card is a nice feature, but to be the ONLY method of getting a photo from the card and allowing it to only ONE device is not a very good implementation.<br /><br />Until they add more flexibility to how and where photos can be transfered, this is not the card for me.",

The case is phenomenal at protecting the screen when the ipad is in a bag. While it offers no protection for the back of the ipad, the cover is minimal and ensures that the primary device can be used with one hand at all times, and from all angles. Despite appearances, the hinge has held strong despite rough usage.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The magnets just are not strong enough. When I flip the cover to the back, it sticks, but any bump will cause the back to fall and just hang. The spine of the cover sticks without a problem most of the time, but it comes off easier than I would like. When using the case as a stand, it collapses with very little urging unless it's positioned just right and on the perfect surface. I've had many occasions where I've been watching a movie while doing something else and someone will bump the table. The stand collapses into a heap. I've not had any damage as a result, but it's a but annoying.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />This thing feels cheap. It works great for the most part, but it feels cheap. I really wish I could switch the side this connects on. I know that's a very minor problem, but it's something I'd like to see in the future. \\\\\"How are they supposed to do that?\\\\\" I don't know, I'm not a designer. I'm just saying that it's something I'd like to see.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br /><br />I bought the cover, and I'd happily buy it again. I wish it was a little cheaper, but I knew what I was getting into. If you're looking for a minimalist cover that protects the screen of your ipad while traveling and doubles as a reasonably capable stand, this is the cover for you. If you're looking for a protective case, it's not. Despite its flaws, the cover works as intended and is a great compliment to your ipad.",

It can be set up for using a USB drive or a printer.  I was going to use it as a printer and it showed up in My Computer/Network but I had a problem.  When I clicked it, Windows 7 pops up a window to install a printer and if your printer is not in the list that Windows 7 provides, it gives the option to load one from disk.  The problem is I have a HP printer and HP does not provide a simple driver anymore.  Even the basic driver that HP provides is an exe file for printers and when ran, it expects the printer to be connected directly to a USB port or it will not install.  So much for a printer.<br /><br />Edit 08-26-2013  Printer problem on USB port solved.  It was complicated but I got my HP printer installed and it works good.  I ran the basic driver exe file from HP and told it to continue without connecting the printer to a USB port.  It completed but did not install the printer.  It did create a HP folder in C:\\Program Files and in that folder are the drivers and inf files for the printer.  I went back to My Computer/Network and the LinkStation where it displays lp for the USB port.  Clicked it and told Windows I have disk in the C:\\Program Files\\HP folder and it installed the printer.  A bit complicated and it should be easier.  After Windows installs the printer, it's ok to uninstall the HP software but don't delete the printer in Devices.  Windows copies all the files it needs to the Windows folder.<br /><br />Edit 08-27-2013  I checked Firefox 3.5 and Internet Explorer 8 and both are for Windows XP.

One major problem is the web access part and Buffalo could easily solve the addressing part of it by masking the address of the LinkStation at Buffalonas.com  ...

I knew that any keyboard for an iPad that was built into a portable case would be small; however, the keys on this keyboard are tiny and all jammed together. The keys on the Zagg keyboard are about the same size but are spaced out so it feels more like typing on a regular size keyboard. It seems like the New Trent keyboard did not take full advantage of its available space and just mashed everything together. As I said, I knew that any portable keyboard for the iPad would be small, and I have read several reviews where the author said they eventually got used to the size. I just don't think I personally could adapt to it. Also, the keys themselves feel a bit cheap. The small size and the quality together make what feels like a toy keyboard.  Negatives: keyboard too small, keyboard and case feel cheap. Positives: keyboard can be extended/pulled out, screen can be adjusted to provide a range of viewing angles.",

Most of the instructions are as bad as others have said.  I skipped the installation CD since my network IP address space is the same as the default on the camera (192.168.1.X). The camera comes from the factory with a static IP of 192.168.1.126. I didn't have any other device at that address so I plugged the camera into my network, opened my browser and entered the IP address ([...] This address seems to be a factory default but can be changed using the administration pages accessible once you sign onto the camera via the browser.<br /><br />The default user is 'admin' with no password (you can change this in the admin section as well.) You'll need to plug a network cable in and access it via the IP address to set up the wireless. You can change the IP port to the normal 80 that browsers use if you'd prefer to not use the :81 port designation at the end.<br /><br />Additional follow up:<br />This camera has a great picture and overall I'm pleased with the performance.  I hard-wired this camera -- one, because I could easily and two, the wireless seemed to be unreliable.  The only other negative I found is that the date reverts to December of 1969 if you reboot the camera for any reason. I tried using an NTP server (the NTP servers already listed seemed to be incorrect) without success. For the price and quality of the image, I'll accept the wireless and time problems.",

I see that Logitech now supports this mouse in OSX so maybe I will contact them again and see if I can get something done.  First of all, the mouse has a lot of good features.  It fits well in the hand, it is very precise, and it has good some helpful buttons.  BUT, I absolutely hate the scroll wheel.  There is a little button on top to stop the scroll wheel from free scrolling.  I have to keep this pressed in or the mouse randomly scrolls against my will.  I could live with that if that was the problem.  When you lock the scroll wheel in place you can feel each click as you turn it.  My mouse moves between 2-4 scrolls per turn.  It will also scroll without the wheel making a full click.  So for gaming this mouse takes away a major function of scrolling weapons.  I literally can not scroll up one weapon at a time with this mouse.  Last time I checked there was no option to change the number of scroll lines anywhere in the software.  I gave up a while ago and writing this review has me curious to see if things have changed.  It's not just games that are affected though.  I can not even scroll a webpage without the thing jumping around.  It has been like that from day one.  I tried to adjust every parameter in the control center software pertaining to the wheel and nothing helps.  I was assuming that you can change some other functionality in Windows and they don't have the same problem, ie the generally positive reviews.  Maybe the problem is fixed; I am going to contact their support again and see if I can get any help.  That being said, the two star rating is for the item I received not the product line.",

            "input": "After working out issues with the product (via software), I'd say this is a fairly solid deal.<br /><br />Streaming:<br />My main goal was to live stream my console gameplay to Twitch.tv - I could have gotten an internal capture card, but I looked at the reviews and thought I'd give this a spin for now.  I'm also hoping to livestream my gameplay for a fundraising/gaming event in November. So it was time to start early and test things out.<br /><br />For the first day that I used the LGP, I downloaded XSplit software (the unit I bought came with a 3-month Premium License).  XSplit itself seems very straightfoward and easy to use.  However, I wasn't feeling confident about the LGP because the quality coming from the unit itself looked very pixelated, with ghosting in any dark colors/darks on the screen.<br /><br />I upped my bandwidth/upstream and the quality still seemed poor. I was disheartened, but I wondered why there were so many good reviews? You could chalk it up to user error/discovery.... Or just somewhat, non-so-immediately-intuitive features:<br /><br />I discovered that, within XSplit at least, I could access an AVERmedia driver/properties window that allowed me to adjust the setting from &#34;Low&#34; up to &#34;Ultra&#34;. For whatever reason, it was set to &#34;Low&#34; by default.  Once I stumbled onto this and changed the setting, the stream was very clear. For those who may have run into this problem, here was my solution:<br /><br />1. XSplit: In the current scene, if you're gameplay 'camera' is there, right click anywhere over the camera. There should be a 'Configure' button for the Avermedia.<br />2. Click on 'Configure'<br />3. Change the setting to &#34;Ultra&#34; (it wasn't even on 'Low', just a blank for me!)<br /><br />RECentral software:<br />The RECentral software is for capturing video from the LGP to your PC and streaming without using another program like XSplit or OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), but I still use it to switch inputs whenI'm live streaming via Twitch and using XSplit.<br /><br />For my tests, I have a WiiU & Xbox360 connected via HDMI and a PS3 connected via component (the LGP comes with a component (female) to AV-In (male). In order to switch between these inputs during a livestream, I have to use RECentral to switch input profiles.  XSplit and/or the software doesn't like it when I switch from HDMI to Component on the fly, so I have to refresh the camera's properties from within XSplit, otherwise the visual (on the broadcaster, not the actual TV) is glitched/choppy.<br /><br />Capture:<br />RECentral is serviceable.. I was able to capture 1080p 30fps video of Xbox360 gameplay just fine to my PC. I tried several minutes of capture and it seemed fine! It can save them as MP4s, but there is also the &#34;timeshift&#34; feature that exports the movies to a .TS format. I haven't delved into this so I can't say more about it.<br /><br />Free-PC Capture:<br />I tried this, again with the 360. You still have to use the Free-PC Capture Utility (via USB hookup to your PC) to change the resolution and data-bitrate, but it works as described. Pushed the big button on the unit and it recorded clips without issue and without hooking it up to a PC.  The LGP does NOT come included with an SD memory card. You'll want to provide your own Class 10 card, as it says on the label. Also, I couldn't bring up the LGP as a drive (in order to just copy the data off) - I had to take the SD card out and put it into an SD card reader. Could someone tell me if I'm doing it wrong? ;)<br /><br />I give it a generous 4-stars because it's a compact unit that does deliver good results for what I need it to do.  I took a star off due to the issues and the 'first impression' of just seeing poor streaming quality.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is that, over at the AVERmedia forums, tech support from the company seems non existent for a few weeks now.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything comes up with the LGP, especially before livestreaming for a long time in November!",

However, the left and right edges of the front piece were right on target.<br /><br />The back piece, on the other hand was a bit more troublesome. When the cut-out for the microphone was centered, the bottom end of the piece is off by a few millimeters, leaving the bottom of the iPad mini not very well protected. A little stretching had to be done to protect the area around the volume buttons and orientation/mute switch as well. The small piece that's used to block the hole for the SIM card tray on WiFi-only models leaves a noticeable gap as well.<br /><br />As mentioned, it offers side and corner protection. The back piece is cut such that there are four tails that can be wrapped around the corners. It's difficult to get them to adhere properly, especially when you have to re-adhere the main part of the piece a few times to get it all properly fitted. I would have preferred these tails to come as separate pieces instead; it would make them easier to manipulate/adjust.<br /><br />The micro-bubbles for both sides went away a little quicker than with other films. Whether that has to do with the weather, the formulation of the spray they provide (which is nearly all water anyway), or the film itself, I couldn't say.<br /><br />Overall, the protection is pretty good, the film protecting the screen is pretty transparent, and it doesn't feel tacky to the touc.

It's built pretty sturdy (which is a great thing) but that is probably why the hinges don't release the top half of the laptop with one hand unless you hold the bottom half down with your other hand.

Originally I had a very old wireless router (only 802.b, so limited to 11 mpb/s), and the reception was indeed poor. Wireless internet speed was intolerable.

It's not hard to do, just tricky. Remove the paint or sticker over the screw on the side of the case, press in two tabs at the top and bottom, and the cover slides off (with a lot of coaxing).<br /><br />Once I had the case open, it was pretty simple to free the WD Caviar drive from the housing. These are SATA drives. Open the computer case, connect power and the SATA cable, a brief driver self install, a reboot, and this drive has a second life as an internal drive.<br /><br />I fully expect that this drive will last a good long time internally. Simple surgery and the drive has a whole new life.<br /><br />By the way, this is actually a pretty noisy external drive. Although there is no fan, the drive makes a pretty decent noise while spun up.

I've bought all sorts of external hard drives, and it's a bit of a bummer to get stuck with an \\\\\"old\\\\\" technology.. whether it's USB 1.0, 2.0 or Firewire 400.. if you want USB 3.0, Firewire 800 or eSata you're outta luck.  That's where the GoFlex comes in.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Seagate's portable drives lately as a backup tool.. the compact drives make it easy to keep multiple of them around. I have 8 Freeagent drives now (500GB each -- and 2 copies of each (so basically 500+500+500+500 and then a backup of all of that) for my music, photos, etc.. With the reports of these failing, I'm not at the trust level that I want to keep just 1 copy of everything yet. With that said, using the Freeagent GO and GoFlex drives from their initial launch.. no problems at all!<br /><br />After building a collection (6) of Freeagent GO drives, I loved the style factor.. compact, had a nice dock, felt strong, even looked good with the \\\\\"stars\\\\\" that light up when plugged in. With the price of those now staying high while the GoFlex drives came down, I decided to give that a try for my next (2) drives.  I've previously used the GoFlex Desk 2TB, but not these portable (USB-powered) drives.<br /><br />These are just about the same size as the 500GB GO Drives, with the exception the connector dock end is rounded instead of flat.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the super-glossy finish.. it leaves fingerprints all over it -- the freeagent go drives used a matte finish which didn't leave any marks. The material also feels much less secure (like if you drop it or even hold it too tightly it will easily crumble - the Go did not feel this way).<br /><br />It uses the same mini USB connection as the GO - you can even use the dock from the GO with this one (although it's a bit tricky to line up). The included Seagate software is easy to use to configure the drive (sleep time, etc..) and can be removed without any problems (some of these require software on the drive to be used).<br /><br />The dock for the GoFlex only has 1 USB plug - the Freeagent GO uses 2 plugs in case your USB connection is low-powered and requires extra power (since there is no AC adapter, all power and data are run through a single USB cable).<br /><br />The \\\\\"adapter\\\\\" end (USB/Firewire/eSata) feels cheap and flimsy.. another part that you think might break even when just trying to plug it in.<br /><br />Overall though - besides the design and possible build quality issues (I never dropped it - I can't say if it would actually break if I did), I think it's a good drive. It has some negatives compared to the GO, but the lower price point and flexibility to change connectors is very nice.he GoFlex only has 1 USB plug - the Freeagent GO uses 2 plugs in case your USB connection is low-powered and requires extra power (since there is no AC adapter, all power and data are run through a single USB cable).

I rarely return stuff I buy online but in this case I had no choice. The drive is just not reliable it disconnects every few minutes regardless of whether you are using the USB or the eSATAb cable sold separately. I really wanted to like this drive so initially I thought maybe it's an issue with Seagate software that comes with the drive so I formatted the drive (NTFS). I tested basic functionality (copied, deleted, created some folders, etc.) it started disconnecting randomly, after reconnecting the cable the drive worked for a few minutes then randomly disconnected again. Then I tried with other file systems (FAT32, exFat, etc.) and executed a couple of tests with a combination of USB/eSATAb connections and OSes Windows 7, MacOS X Snow Leopard and it disconnected several times from both of the computers, some of the those times I'd even lost the ability to access the files on the drive and had to re-format the drive again and again (fortunately I had the precaution of keeping the files save in another drive).   From this review I hope you figure the following if this drive is not reliable for simple functionality test within a few minutes, imagine the data loss catastrophe you could face in the long term even if the drive works for you for the first couple of hours.   When we are talking about nearly 1.5 TB of storage space you better get a reliable drive. This one is not worth it. The idea is great and hopefully Seagate will find a way to fix all of the issues by the time they release the next version of this drive and still offer a price much lower than the competiotion but for now I'd strongly recommend you to keep away from this one, even if like me you are able to find a reasonable price...",

The reason I purchased this was because my Belkin N+ could not keep a solid connection either wired or wireless.

I carried a flash drive im my pocket so that I always have access to my data, but the old one just wasn't rugged enough to co-mingle with coins and keys.    I purchased this unit specifically because of it's claims to be rugged.  In that regard I have not been disappointed.  The rubber o-ring on the inside should provide good protection from moisture, but I haven't tried to see if it will float.      I carry the Corsair Flash Survivor on my keyring, which is usually in my pocket.  The outside of the aluminum case is showing a little wear from the keys, as I would expect, but drive itself is protected.    I have two issues with the flash drive.  First, one of the labels on the drive was not correctly applied in the factory and had to be removed the first week I had it to prevent it from sticking to other items.  This alone wouldn't have been enough to lower the rating if it wasn't for the second problem.    The quality and design of the rubber rings on the outside is an issue if you intend to carry this around like I do.  Both of them are loose, and the one attached to the flash drive itself spins freely.  It has even come detached a few times in my pocket, but so far I haven't lost it.    Overall, this a great product.  And if you don't plan to carry it everywhere, you might not experience this issue.",

The Hummer is actually one of those military vehicles that have made it mainstream. Ideazon makes the claim that the ZNP-1000 Fang is one of those equipment tested by the military and declassified for civilian use. Talk about controlling weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />The Fang weighs around 1.5Lb (0.8Kg) it is package. It is protected by a thick box and a solid transparent plastic mold. Encased in its shell is the controller, a wrist rest, one CD containing the Zboard Z-Engine software and two manuals.<br /><br />The Merchandise:<br /><br />The Fang comprises of 41 keys which is functional as a regular keyboard. The standard keyboard has 105 keys so don't expect it to replace your regular keyboard. Remember that this is for fragging people away not for typing It has 6 massive keys in a shape of a butterfly, ASWD are part of keys we control our player, the Q & E can be used diagonally or for weapon selection, depending on the games. The buttons surrounding the direction keys are small Skittle-sized buttons. For big hands, this is not what I recommend, the fact big fingers may depress two buttons at one time is a big issue, there is ample space for your fingers but remember, when you game, game in comfort. For players with the right fit, selected Skits (Skittle Buttons) have dimples and some with concaves for identification. I did wish that the buttons could be easier to remember with embedded characters for finger tip reading like mahjong.<br /><br />Continuing off the last batch of buttons would be the controversial thumb button which takes a little bit of getting used to. We often take for granted the large size of the Space Bar. Well things couldn't be worse when you find out that the Space Bar replacement is almost the size of a medicine capsule, I did mention controversial and I leave that up to you. During game play I did find myself forgetting that I had a thumb. Finally, the remaining 6 buttons would be the ones near the palm. Having three on both sides below the ring finger and index finger. It definitely takes a little getting used to, but it is useful nonetheless.<br /><br />Looking at the bottom of the pad, rubberized feet and an option to slightly elevate the pad help make the gaming experience easier. It is important that I stress out proper gaming posture for your arm and hand which should be the same way as you were playing on a normal keyboard.<br /><br />Aside from the norm, the Fang has multimedia keys to control your audio during game play and the an emblazoned Z-Board logo that glows white for that extra bling.<br /><br />Software Support:<br /><br />The package comes with a CD with the Z-Engine application. I would suggest you download the latest version so that you get an update profile. If you are running on dial up, install the software from the CD and update so it will download the latest profiles for you. The bad side of the Z-Engine, keys are customized for each game and you need to activate the key set of each game. Unfortunately, the Z-Engine software does not allow you to customize your own controls so for sports games and others on the list, they may need to wait. Over all the software work fine, unfortunately, I can't really give my full point of view since I have only tried it with Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />If you are expecting that the gamer in you will come out with this gaming keyboard, it will provided that you practice. It will take time especially for those who are so used to the regular keyboard. Quality build, lots of buttons, military tested, there are so many things going right for this gaming keyboard but the thumb key may prove to be the Achilles heel of this marvelous product, then again, practice makes perfect.<br /><br />Uppers:<br /><br />* Dedicated gaming keypad with more than enough buttons<br /><br />* Multimedia Controls<br /><br />* Dimpled keys make identification easier<br /><br />* Large ASWD buttons<br /><br />* Ambidextrous<br /><br />Downers:<br /><br />* Transition to the Fang requires a learning curve when moving from a keyboard<br /><br />* Thumb key will never replace the Space Bar<br /><br />* Keys NOT YET customizable<br /><br />* Not built for button mashing<br /><br />* Not for everybody<br /><br />Wish list:<br /><br />* Add-on glow features for the keys for dark gaming environment<br /><br />* Sticker Badge<br /><br />* More dimples and dents on the keys for identification<br /><br />* Game detection and auto key change<br /><br />Alternatives:<br /><br />* Logitech G15 Gaming Keyboard<br /><br />* Belkin Nostromo Speedpad n52<br /><br />* WolfKing Warrior Gaming Keyboard/>Uppers: <br />* Dedicated gaming keypad with more than enough buttons <br />* Multimedia Controls <br />* Dimpled keys make identification easier <br />* Large ASWD buttons <br />* Ambidextrous <br /> <br />Downers: <br />* Transition to the Fang requires a learning curve when moving from a keyboard <br />* Thumb key will never replace the Space Bar <br />* Keys NOT YET customizable <br />* Not built for button mashing <br />* Not for everybody <br /> <br />Wish list: <br />* Add-on glow features for the keys for dark gaming environment <br />* Sticker Badge <br />* More dimples and dents on the keys for identification <br />* Game detection and auto key change <br /> <br />Alternatives: <br />* Logitech G15 Gaming Keyboard <br />* Belkin Nostromo Speedpad n52 <br />* WolfKing Warrior Gaming Keyboard",

It comes in a choice of kid-pleasing colors (well, I like colors too, I must admit. I bought a clear purple keyboard recently, so who'm I kiddin'!) Now, this tablet-mouse pad is a darn clever idea. Both a graphics tablet and a mouse are \\\\\"human interface devices\\\\\" or pointing devices for the computer (how you move around and click on items on the screen.) So having a combination mouse/pen pad is nice as you can eliminate your regular mouse. And I can tell you, cordless mice are the way to go. Much more comfortable than mice with cords.<br /><br />I prefer my Logitech cordless mouse to the mouse on the Graphire as it isn't as smooth as the Logitech, and I also use an ergonomic mouse pad to prevent wrist strain. You must use the Graphire mouse on the Graphire pad--that's how the electronic connection is made, through the tablet. Still, this is a wonderful interface especially if you have kids. They can draw and paint on the computer. What a great idea. And this is wonderful for creating digital art for your webpage. (ok, who'm I kidding!

The only thing that I am very disappointed in is that there is no way to configure a middle click on the trackpad.  Windows 10 (which installed easily) has three and four finger options for the trackpad (one finger is left click, two is right click) but neither of those can be configured as a middle click.  Also, the trackpad continues onto the buttons, so it's both difficult to feel where the right and left click buttons are, and clicking them tends to cause the cursor to jump.  I don't *think* this is too much of a hardship, as the one- and two-finger clicks seem to work well.<br /><br />In general, Windows 10 offers more trackpad configuration options than Windows 8.1, so I'd definitely recommend you do the upgrade.

If you're using newer modules or devices that integrate on protocols such as I2C, or you're trying to get those wonderfully time consuming sensor sketches and libraries you composed in the Arduino IDE to have some way to communicate with the Raspberry Pi, consider this model. Long story short is that if you're using mostly 3.3v sensors and communicating serial data from an Arduino unit elsewhere, this is a great board.<br /><br />While the board does not come with pin headers, I simply soldered my own on so that it would fit neatly on my new and very large Elenco breadboard. This thing spans about the width of a standard breadboard, so you'd need two next to each other to wire it in. I would say the main advantage from my perspective is that I'm no longer worried about the wires falling out of my Arduino Uno as it's positioned tenuously at the edge of my prototype circuits. I can toss my breadboard down on the couch and not worry that parts will fly everywhere.<br /><br />This board makes an excellent complement to the Adafruit modules running at 3.3v. I say 3.3v, but again, that's only the logic level. You can power this board with a standard 5v PSU or do the old 7805 IC, two caps, and a few jumpers on the breadboard to regulate voltage from your battery and/or \\\\\"wall-wart.\\\\\"<br /><br />A few notes - an FTDI cable is necessary to program this board. No standard USB header. It also runs at 8 mhz because of the lower voltage, but I have heard around of some overclocking. I'll leave that to the others. Finally, if you do some \\\\\"fritzing\\\\\" what's great about a board without pin headers is that you can just drop your board onto your finished \\\\\"Fritzing Fab\\\\\" board when you've modeled your project on the breadboard!<br /><br />Cheers to a good product!<br /><br />Update as of 10/28/2012<br /><br />Although this is a great board - there's more and more models on the market that are great as well. The issue of direct USB connectivity is one that is frustrating for me as an Arduino user. So if you want USB capability without the associated FTDI header or accessory FTDI chip, consider the headerless Arduino Leonardo on Amazon. Or if you're a real \\\\\"Arduino Pro\\\\\" just bootload an ATMEGA chip and run your sketches directly off a 28 pin DIP with the right crystal, the correct voltage, and a few capacitors and resistors (do a web search for \\\\\"Arduino on a Breadboard\\\\\"). My afterthought on purchasing this product is yeah, 3.3v is nice, but certainly I can just create my own bidirectional logic level converter or purchase one here on Amazon (3.3v/5v and vice-versa). After using this for a few weeks, I'll probably end up embedding this on a custom PCB for a specific application rather than using this for regular prototyping. Because of the convenience of direct-to-usb connectivity (and less connection issues) with the Leonardo, I'll probably do most of my coding and debugging on the Leonardo and drop the \\\\\"Pro\\\\\" into a finished product. So (1) great for a finished product - you can overlay the connectors onto your PCB CAD design after this has been programmed with your sketch and embed this as MCU \\\\\"base station\\\\\" on your project - but it's a little frustrating for day to day use because of the fact you need the FTDI cable or a second Arduino (or some other device) to program this board.nd more models on the market that are great as well.

When darker colors fill the screen, the monitor dims. When lighter colors fill the screen, the monitor brightens. Smart idea to save power, if it wasn't annoying as hell. The settings seem to re-enable themselves every time you reboot, so you have to keep turning it off, over and over.<br /><br />The flaw: Touchpad. It starts off working fine, you'll notice Synaptics lags a bit when you use the multitouch scrolling. Then you'll notice Synaptics eating CPU cycles when you're not even touching it, and eventually multi-touch will stop working. No more scrolling, no more tap to click. You'll have to use the physical button to click. Occasionally it flips out and the cursor will start flying all over the screen, clicking at random. Eventually it will just stop working, and not start working again until you shut down the computer completely, and start it back up.<br /><br />I've tried every driver available for it, including some that were intended for other touchpads.

It's sporadic, yet persistent.<br /><br />I rarely return things, but unfortunately in this case, it's going back.<br /><br />If anyone else is having the same issue, just Google &#34;Inspiron 11 touchpad&#34; without the quotes, and click on the first result.

It was like an extension of my own body.<br /><br />I could forgive it its inability to no longer right-click in its old age, but sometime this summer the poor old thing started left clicking and double clicking randomly all on its own. Rather than let it, and me, continue to suffer with the computer mouse equivalent of Parkinson's, I got a new one and pulled my long time friend's batteries for the last time.<br /><br />The new one will never replace that special bond we had, but it does have something going for it that the old one never will -- a clutch! On the scroll wheel! Who knew something so simple could give so much joy?<br /><br />I'm not ashamed to admit that I can spend minutes every day disengaging the gears, giving the wheel a big spin like I'm trying to win the showcase on The Price Is Right, and watching my Facebook friends' posts scroll on by at lightning speed. Why, on a good day I'll wind up staring at someone's post from last year by the time the wheel finally stops.<br /><br />So Logitech, I salute you. At first what I thought was just pointless turns out to be the missing feature to revolutionize my procrastination.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Other than that, this mouse is rather largish for a mobile mouse, which I like since I'm using it on my desktop. It is a bit heavy with two batteries in it, but I also like that. For my hand it's about 1\\\\\" too short, but the curvature of the mouse is perfect. It's dead easy to set up and Windows automatically installs the correct driver. You only need to install the Logitech software if you want the extra features. The only downside is that, as others have noted, you probably want to keep the tiny receiver away from your WiFi router because it can cause interference that makes the mouse behavior erratic. My keyboard has an extra USB port in the rear so I plugged it in there and have had no problems. The battery life also appears to be as long as advertised. I've had it a couple of months now and have not noticed that the battery's charge has dropped one bit. However, the mouse does have an off/on switch on its bottom so I turn it off at night.",

The actual colors of the cases are quite dull and I must say, I was disappointed. Another issue is that it doesn't hold the kindle up on any kind of flat, desk-top surface. It just slides and falls flat. For the price, I would have expected it to do so much more than the MUCH less expensive one I bought for my own 8&#34; Kindle Fire. There are many other cases out there that have flaps and latches, etc. to hold them up and keep your kindle safe that cost half as much. This case is sturdy and I don't doubt that it will protect my kids kindles, but there are so many better choices. I suggest you shop around.",

You set down your lemonade and open up the case, start typing away...it's awkward and cumbersome, and you aren't sure if you can power through it.<br />But that's the least of your worries, because you've just spilled your lemonade on yourself.  The sugary-sour daisy-colored liquid becomes sticky and uncomfortable as it attempts to fuse your clothes to your skin.  The lemon-scented goodness begins to permeate and attract a small swarm of yellow jackets begin to move in around you, buzzing and bouncing around against your skin, needling you with their pointy little feet and stingers.  Filled with panic, you stand up suddenly, which triggers the \\\\\"fight\\\\\" response of the bees, and they attack full force, stinging every bit of your exposed skin.  As your upper torso is met with a barrage of tiny stingers piercing your flesh, you realize that your legs had fallen asleep as you were sitting in the flimsy plastic chair, and they immediately become gelatin, causing you to hurtle towards your insufficiently attached deck railing.<br />As the weight of your healthy adult body is afforded no resistance as it drifts effortlessly through the pressure-treated railing that the contractor assured you was perfectly secure (even though it felt shoddy and wobbly), you can feel gravity take hold of you and pull you towards the Earth several feet below.  Your instincts to feebly prevent injury by putting your hands out in front of you as you fell were met with a thud, several crunches, and then another thud as the rest of your body lands haplessly on the fallen deck railing in your backyard.  You are given a slight relief from the pain as the adrenaline courses through your veins, until the angry yellow jackets catch up with your now-mangled body, angrier than ever.  Your left leg has now fully gained circulation, but the deck railing has splintered, and that sharp stake has punctured straight through your thigh.  Your throat is dry, because you never even got one sip of that delicious lemonade, so you can't even call for help, though you wouldn't be able to anyways, because your lungs are filling up with fluid.<br />After what seems to be a millenium, the gasping, the constant boring of yellow jacket stingers, the broken bones, the throbbing of chemical-treated wood wrapped in muscle tissue, and the dull pain of internal bleeding begin to fade as your internal organs start to shut down, your heart slows, your vision fades, and your mind starts to submit to the influence of dimethyltryptamine.<br />As you struggle to will your own eyelids to close before you walk into the light, one very blissful thought crosses your mind: \\\\\"At least this is better than using the IVSO Slim Faux Leather Keyboard Case.\\\\\"iling in your backyard.

In the end, it's only a minor inconvenience, but it's enough to keep my rating from 5/5.<br /><br />Overall Pros:<br />-Looks Professional<br />-Decent protection for both the tablet and keyboard docking station<br />-Easy to separate tablet from keyboard while keeping the case on both components.<br />-Third flap has room for papers, business card, etc.<br /><br />Overall Cons:<br />-The strap issue described above.<br />-Makes for a mediocre stand when using only the tablet (conversely, it does just fine when in \\\\\"laptop\\\\\" mode).",

But again, the price out weights this minor issue (its not that bad, I will upload a image later).<br />  - Closing the case does not stay \\\\\"closed\\\\\". Without the strap holding it shut it does not stay nice and flat like a hardcover book when closed. This is a minor issue but would like to have had it stay flat closed without the strap.<br />  - The area that the iPad slides into, the edging does not sit flush with the iPad. I can not describe this great so I will upload a picture at some point. This also may be way the case does not shut flat.<br /><br />Functionality: 5/5<br />  - Rotating function works great. I was was not sure if I would rotate to portrait but then I found a few Magazine applications that force iPad to be Portrait so I am happy I have the ability.<br />  - Magnet \\\\\"Smart cover\\\\\" function: This works but not perfectly. What I mean is if you close the case and the magnet is not aligned right the iPad stays on.  I have found you just need to close it right and put the strap around it and its fine.  This goes back to my last statement in Quality, if it closed flat it would work perfectly.<br /><br />Price: 5/5<br /><br />Overall: 4/5<br />  I would recommend this to a person that does not want to drop close to double the money for the [[ASIN:B004N62HZI Targus THZ045US Versavu 360 Degrees Rotating Stand Case for Apple iPad 2 (Black/Blue Interior)]] which does NOT have the magnet but I feel has a higher \\\\\"quality\\\\\" factor.",

Cons:  It's a little expensive for the size of the product but if you aren't cleaning your screen daily, it should last a while.

I wasn't even looking for quality equivalent to my sound card.  I simply needed sound from my Gateway laptop because the sound card was no longer working and I would have to replace the entire motherboard to fix it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I have been extremely disappointed with this product.  First, I had to run it in \\\\\"standard\\\\\" rather than \\\\\"advanced\\\\\" mode to get it to work.  Perhaps with more fiddling I could have gotten it to work in \\\\\"advanced\\\\\" mode, but for $100 I expect a plug-and-play.  Secondly, even in \\\\\"standard\\\\\" mode, I sometimes get all kinds of pops, static and distortion (I tried multiple headphones and speakers, so its the card, not the speakers).  There appears to be no rhyme or reason for when it decides to work and when it does not. <br /> <br />The biggest problem I've found is that if I bump the card, which is easy to do since it sticks out about an inch from the laptop, it sometimes causes the computer to crash (the computer is a 2004 Gateway 450RG laptop, running Windows XP Professional).  Not just hang up, but a blue screen appears that tells you a fatal error has occurred and the computer promptly restarts so that you lose whatever you were working on in addition to the annoyance of having to restart.  It would be one thing to have the Creative Labs software hang-up or crash, but there is no acceptable reason for a $100 hardware card to cause the computer to crash and restart. <br /> <br />I give it one star only because it does produce decent sound most of the time (in \\\\\"standard\\\\\" mode) - but what causes it to work poorly the rest of the time remains a mystery.",

I'm not charging it again, it's being shipped back.<br /><br />Too bad, that one flaw makes this thing a loser. Seriously, it's such a shame because this mouse is so gorgeous and its performance while in use is just amazing, but that battery just won't let it do what you need it to. After reading more about this mouse, it seems the Performance MX has been getting panned since day 1 due to poor battery life. However, if you can deal with the battery issue, you will love this mouse. I dislike sending it back, but I can't deal with it. This is the reason it has a 2 out of 5 stars rating. Fix the battery issue and you have a solid 4.5 or 5 star mouse. It really is amazing, but just unmanageable with a 24 hour battery life-cycle.",

This can be frustrating when you want to download a CD onto iTunes or watch a DVD on your computer.  Watching videos on the internet can also be a problem because of the computer's slow speed. A short YouTube clip works fine, but a full movie will repeatedly stop and load. Pulling up your internet browser can take a while, and if you have too many tabs (approximately five) on the internet it will become unresponsive. The netbook is also too slow to have a Skype conversation, even though there is a camera built in.  The battery power in the computer is quite long lasting, although it takes around three hours to fully charge.  Even though the key board is smaller than a usual laptop's it doesn't feel it at all, but the keys tend to be sticky.   The mouse pad is a little hard to control.

I would be interested to know if my review were actually read since at the time I am writing this there are about 14k reviews.    I like the battery life but it represents the absolute maximum you might ever get.  I bought scrabble and use a case that has a pull out light and these two items must use up quite a bit of battery life.  As it is recommeneded, I turn off the 3g and wireless when not browsing/downloading.    I read a lot in bed.  With most traditional books the words go down all the way to the bottom of the page which is a problem if you want to pull up your blanket over your chest.  Since the kindle has the keyboard at the bottom the blanket dilemma has been solved.  I know this comment is a bit silly.    I have noticed that the bookstore browser is a bit slow.  I recommend using your computer to find the book you want to read next then just search for it on the kindle then download it.  I do not recommend browsing for books with the kindle.  Somewhat ironically, by the time you get back to your home screen your book is downloaded and ready to be read.      Somewhat interestingly, for your wish list items to appear on your kindle the kindle version of the product must be added to your wish list.  If you are like me, and you made good use of your wish lists before you get your kindle this may be disappointing.  I know there are technical reasons for this but I still wish this was not the case.    The six inch display is fine.  It might sound small but it is the size of most smaller paperbacks.    The screen quality is great.    I have a hunch that the page turn button on the side of the kindle will end up being the least durable part of the kindle but this is just a hunch.

I've only had it for perhaps two months, so I haven't had it long enough to see if it withstands the \\\\\"test of time\\\\\", but it shows no sign of wearing out or developing any issues.<br /><br />One feature that I absolutely love about this case, which I have not seen displayed in any of the pictures for it, is that it really has three landscape positions.  The first two are displayed in pictures for the product, where you open the cover, lay it upside down on the table, and fold the Kindle over it to rest in one of the two grooves.  The third position I have found is to fold the cover back and tuck it in behind the Kindle, which leaves it in a very secure position midway between the two grooves on the cover.  I hope this makes sense.  For me it's the perfect angle for playing a game in landscape, or even watching a video.<br /><br />My one primary complaint, and the ONLY reason I am replacing it now (as well as the only reason I haven't given it a five star rating) is the issue others have mentioned.  With the Kindle fully inserted into the case and in the landscape position, the bottom edge becomes difficult to access.  I like a suggestion I just read from someone else here, to tuck something like a napkin inside to push the Kindle slightly out.  I may go ahead and do that while I wait for my new cover to arrive.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great cover that I've gotten a lot of use from.  However, I'm looking forward to getting my new [[ASIN:B005KDYBIO Kindle Fire Genuine Leather Cover by Marware, Brown]]!",

The case is excellent when you are using the tablet as a &#34;notebook&#34;.

If you are watching a movie in this way the keyboard is explosed to the surface you place it on. I like the wake up feature but the case is a bit flimsy-- wish it was just a little more secure.

In the pictures here the cover looks like it's more of a gray color but in real like it is really white.  The padded corners are awesome for protecting my ipad  and im a big fan of the sleeping function is really convenient.  I had read some reviews on here about how the magnets in the corners had damaged someone's ipad so i didn't want to take any chances so the first thing i did when i got my covers was to put small pieces of cotton in the corners so that the magnets wouldn't come out or damage my ipad and it's worked out great!  Though i do have to say that there is a negative thing and that is that the inside of the screen cover can get dirty pretty easy.  I have only had the chance to clean it once with a moist cloth and it was okay.  All in all i would totally recommend this case for anyone who wants a awesome case for cheap.  The first ipad mini case i purchased cost me over $30 and was nowhere near good as this one.  I am probably going to be purchasing the black one next :)      The only reason it didn't give it 5 stars is for the fact that the inside of the screen cover gets dirty if you are not careful where you stand it.",

Set it to a custom size and set it to 12GB to 20GB and whoohoo, it works much better. It has a little bloatware on it, I was able to remove the useless Wild Tangent games and a few other bloatware items and it runs well. Have been running it for a week now and no issues. I also own an HP quad core I7 with 16gb ram, a high end HP laptop and obviously you get what you pay for. Also looked at other similar laptops, but they were either more money or they could not expand beyond 8gb of memory. Having the option to expand up to 16gb is great.

I like it, but it is different and it does take a little bit to get used to.  After I increased the scroll speed in the Windows mouse settings, it seemed natural to me.<br /><br />* The feel of the mouse is great. I like the contours and the weight is good.

It's a nice position for my thumb to reach, yet I don't find myself accidentally clicking it. It's going to be useful.<br /><br />* The mouse buttons are very quiet. I can't stand loud clicky mice. Some people might miss the feedback.<br /><br />* Scrolling the wheel is completely smooth and silent. You might prefer the little notches that you feel as you scroll on most other mice. I like the quiet and I don't miss the sensation that I'm scrolling over something that feels like rumble strips on the road.<br /><br />* The price is great.<br /><br />It's not perfect, but it has the nice comfortable feel that I was looking for without spending a lot of money.",

The network print server says that the printer is connected and ready.    So I turned off that computer, and went back to mine, to try again.  I try to connect, but it says that the printer driver is occupied by 'Computer 2', so I can't connect. Computer 2 is off!!!

Low speeds and frequent disconnects have returned and it just won't play nice with some machines on my network (a Macbook Pro in particular). I replaced a Linksys WRT54G with DD-WRT with this router, and I think it's time to go back to what worked before.<br /><br />The firmware notification feature in the router console is nice, and I have been keeping up with firmware releases. However, they don't seem to have addressed any of the issues that I'm seeing. If it's too late to return this router, I'll try putting an opensource firmware on it and will find out if it's a hardware or software issue. I'll report back with my findings if I do load an alternate firmware.<br /><br />In summary, save your money and buy something else. This is the most I've ever forked over for a router and I had high expectations. It didn't even come close to comparing with the Linksys 54G wireless routers that you can get off of ebay for $40.",

Further, the keyboard only powers up when the positioning magnets are engaged, so you have the on-screen keybaord when you need it, and you're not draining keyboard power unless you are positioned to type (or watch a movie...).<br /><br />There are a lot of ads out there these days for two-in-ones that just look so dreadfully clunky, i'm at a loss for why someone who prefers to mac environment would get one of those instead of just getting this case.<br /><br />And yes, it just about doubles the thickness and weight of your iPad.

A case in point is the Acer Laptop, even though I pointed out that on Acer.com it stated \\\\\"Unlike desktop computers, acer laptops cannot upgrade their CPU's, you can upgrade their RAM and HDD'S, but you cannot upgrade their CPU\\\\\" That is even though you may have a Intel Mother Board # that says on the Intel's site \\\\\"will support i3, i5, i7 CPU's. Acer has their Mother Boards proprietorially manufactured to only accept the ONE processor that is it's proprietorially set and labeled to, so the customer is forced to purchase a NEW Laptop in order to have a faster CPU. Good for acer, not so good for a acer owner that would just like to have a faster CPU. I am certain that the proprietorially capitalist bean counter business model, actually sends Laptop users AWAY from acer, because it just in the long run is bad business leaving a bad taste in the consumers mouth.<br />In closing, I only had one supplier demand the25% when I ran into the acer business model quagmire, that one supplier does not have me as a customer ANY MORE.

This laptop is very light.  I have a competitor's convertible ultrabook and this is a lot lighter.  The keyboard is also much better than mine, and in fact you would be hard pressed to find a better keyboard.  The screen is smaller than mine but is very sharp.  On the other hand mine is just a tad larger and I think mine has a slightly better screen.  This computer is very fast booting in seconds as opposed to her previous laptop that took forever to boot.  She likes it so much that she's started to take it with her on occasions where she would have taken her iPad.  She hasn't used it much as a tablet yet but I think over time she will.  The bottom line though is that she seems to like it a lot.  The screen is smaller than the 15.6&#34; she used to use but she says this is big enough.  I would say it comes very close to being the perfect convertible ultrabook.  So why did I give it a 4 out of 5 stars?  I was a bit upset over the setup of this laptop.  When I set this up for my wife the very first problem I had was setting up the Internet connection.  This is generally pretty easy but I could not get it to work.  I called Dell and ultimately it ended up that the driver for the WIFI card was not up to date.  Really? Then I had to download the updated driver on another laptop to a USB drive to try to load on this computer.  Guess what?  The USB port would not recognize the USB drive I put in the computer.  You guessed it, the driver for the USB port was not up to date.  Ultimately I was able to force the laptop to recognize the USB drive, download the WIFI driver and get onto the Internet.  From that point I could resolve all my other problems by downloading all the latest drivers.  Also, I did deal with a very helpful and friendly support person from Dell.  I know I've heard of people having issues with Dell support people but in this case I found a good one.  She stayed on the phone with me for as long as it took.  But my real question is, why would Dell release a laptop or any other computer to the general public that would not work as currently configured?  This is just clearly unacceptable and they need to change this.  I don't mind playing around with this kind of thing because that's what I was paid to do for years but if my wife had had to do this herself she would have been bald and probably committed before she figured it all out.  So Dell, you have to do better than this.  You can make all of the great hardware you want to but if someone can not plug this in, go through the step by step instructions and have something work, you're not going to sell a lot of product.",

I don't have very much money but all I needed was something to write essays, do research and submit online assignments with.  -Touch pad is erratic and unreliable The first issue was that the touch pad is extremely sensitive. When I place one finger on the pad and stay as perfectly still as possible, the pointer jumps around in about a 3-inch area surrounding where I am trying to direct it. Sometimes it works better than others. But at times it has taken me up to 3 minutes to click on something, even after rebooting and troubleshooting the Chromebook. This makes it very difficult to get work done.  Some other drawbacks are that... -Netflix is not supported -You can only play video games supported by Google chrome -Google knows EVERYTHING you do -The integrated webcam sucks & most other webcams can't be used with the chromebook because google chrome doesn't support their software. -I have yet to find an alarm clock that will wake the system up from sleep -Microsoft word isn't supported  Perhaps my touch pad is defective. If this is the case then I'd recommend using Chromebook only as a second &#34;computer&#34;.  I will say it's good at booting up quickly and surfing the web just as fast. It's a cool idea but it's not working for me. I recommend a tablet w/ attachable keyboard over this. You can find them for about the same price. I wish I'd done that.  Update: Luckily, Amazon Prime Warehouse has great customer service and a good return policy. I returned my presumably defective Chromebook for a full refund. They even paid return shipping.

The Lightning connector works great if you're using a Lightning CABLE. If you're using an Apple Lightning to 30-pin ADAPTER then the opening is far too narrow and it simply will not fit. The iPad has to be removed from the case to use the adapter. This will certainly cause stress on the corners that keep the case tight and will likely, over time, cause them to crack. I rated it OK because of this. The problem can be fixed with a few minutes work using a Dremel tool. If not for this, it's a 5-star product.",

One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.<br />Software:<br />iOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \\\\\"productivity\\\\\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen. For the price, this is a good buy.",

I WOULD have bought the Kindle Fire, but I just use tablets for reading and the occasional Angry Birds boredom session, so the tradeoff is fair enough for me. Now for the pros:<br /><br />-Excellent screen quality. Images are clear, video playback and streaming so far works great and transitions are near-flawless with the occasional hiccup.<br />-Super thin and light. This tablet is very easy to carry and almost weightless, which is a nice bonus for people who don't like heavy things. I prefer them to be a bit heavier (they feel more secure) but I didn't mind the size here.<br />-Runs graphics heavy apps like Angry Birds Space perfectly, and most apps work great.<br />-Its default browser is surprisingly capable in my opinion and offers competition against Dolphin HD. Haven't had one issue with it.<br />-WiFi connection is easy to set up and the start up wizard is competent.<br />-If I'm correct, you can use this as a webcam on your computer, but I have yet to try this function.<br />-Unlike what most reviews in other product pages say, this product IS compatible with a USB keyboard and mouse. Last I heard (I have yet to try it, will update when I do so), it'sa matter of:<br /><br />1) Go to Settings<br />2) USB Connection<br />3) Change to Host Mode and try plugging in the Keyboard<br /><br />That's it. It has to pick it up.<br /><br />Now for the cons, most of which are surprisingly minor:<br /><br />-Speaker quality is decent but could be better. Audio comes out tinny at times. For what I use it, it works, but I'd prefer using headphones. Their location as well is cumbersome and makes my hands cover them unconsciously.<br />-Lack of a dedicated menu button and other standard buttons. How they were not included is beyond me. This might cause issues with apps like Kindle (latest version) where the Menu icon is strangely gone, making the Menu and settings inaccessible. However, you can install Kindle for 2.1 Android and you'll have no problems.<br />-Kobo's bookstore compatibility is absolutely non-existent. No books ever download, and this reader IS compatible with .epub format- it brought 25 books bundled in, courtesy of the Gutenberg Project. Why Kobo refuses to work here is beyond me.<br />-The Android version on this thing is severely restricted and locked down. You'll see what I mean. Depending on who you ask, you might have to root it. I, however, haven't seen the need to do so.<br />-Awkward plug placement, like Headphone jack and power jack.<br />-No Bluetooth functionality. It's to be expected, and I didn't mind, but the lack of the option is... well, annoying.<br />-Reset button is located RIGHT WHERE THE MICROPHONE IS LOCATED. And it's so small, you need either a paper clip or a mechanical pencil to press the Reset button if the tablet freezes... which will be very rare, if not never.<br />-You can't charge this with the USB cable- you can only charge it with its included AC adapter. Wat. :|<br />-The camera quality is... horrendous. Use it either as a backup (this despite it being 2 MP) or as a makeshift webcam. Then again, that's not what I bought it for.<br />-\\\\\"Protective pouch\\\\\" included is simply inexcusable. This was a major gripe with me. Its cheap quality is so cheap, I can't even close the bag right! They should have at least included a folio case or something.<br /><br />Final verdict: Despite this being sold as a \\\\\"budget tablet\\\\\", I have to say that this rivals the Kindle Fire or even the Nexus at least. This is NOT an iPad, or even a Galaxy Tab, despite it being so functional. But for what you pay, the tradeoff and value are amazing! If you need a good tablet but don't want to waste a lot of money, go with this one. It's a very nice deal with incredible value for the money. I've had it for about a week now, and I haven't had any problems.<br /><br />EDIT, OCTOBER 26TH, 2012: Just got my stylus today and tried it, specifically this one: [[ASIN:B008KWIUH0 3 Pack Aqua Blue/Black/Red Capacitive Stylus/styli Touch Screen Cellphone Tablet Pen for iPhone 4 4s 3 3Gs iPod Touch iPad 2 Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, BlackBerry Playbook Playbook HTC Flyer Evo View Tablet, Barnes and Noble Nook Color, Droid Bionic]] They work perfectly with the tablet. I recommend them if you need to use a stylus.<br /><br />EDIT, NOVEMBER 26TH, 2012: Been using the keyboard and case for a while. Works great and just as I mentioned earlier.

I know I can pay to have this feature removed but I don't feel I should have to pay an additional fee for an ad free screen.<br /><br />2) That the screen saver is either blank or an ad. There are no settings in which to use a saved and treasured picture as screen saver.<br /><br />3) lastly, that there isn't a settings feature to set &#34;desk top&#34; preferences.<br /><br />Overall the quality is great. I would not have paid more than what I did at the promo price of $159. I guess I had hoped it had more features that fall in line with a tablet.

I can't be bothered to send it back, so I I'm just gonna keep it, and burn some dvds so I can write this review :)    I use Ubuntu linux and the drive plugs and plays perfectly.   Burns dvd+R at an average of 5X.  Uses 2 usb ports to power.  As noisy as any other dvd burner, no big deal.   Like the other reviewers mentioned, the case is a bit flimsy... If you try to close the tray with your thumb while holding down the top with your fingers it catches on the tray because the flimsy plastic bends. I imagine it wouldn't survive someone sitting on it by mistake (i.e. if you had it in your bag or something).    I'm not a fan of the cheap looking gray plastic around the sides and face of tray, they should have just made everything glossy black, but that's just my design taste. It does match my samsung external ( [[ASIN:B001IBI0A2 Samsung S2 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive HXMU050DA/G22 (Piano Black)]]), although I wish it came with a case like the external hd did.

The Wireless Desktop 2000 does not live up to my expectations. I am a programmer of 25 years and while not a formally trained typist, I can get things done with a good keyboard. I am really struggling with this one. The biggest issues:<br /><br />- The layout is cramped: the numeric and cursor blocks are adjacent to the main keyboard without any space in between. I sometimes miss the space between the backspace and insert keys, and the right Ctrl and the cursor left keys. The keyboard feels a bit tight and I make a lot of typing errors. This is the most frustrating issue.<br />- The F(unction) keys are tiny, are slightly more to the right than usual, and difficult to find without looking. The F labels are small and difficult to read. On the other hand, the multimedia keys above the F keys are gigantic in comparison, and I hardly ever use them.<br />- The wireless transmitter does not sit on the desktop like the old one, but is plugged directly into the USB port of the computer under the desk. Sometimes keys are swallowed, even though the batteries are new and I replaced them once, just to be sure. Other reviewers seem to observe this problem as well. The battery status LED on the keyboard sometimes lights up even with new batteries. Maybe this is related.<br />- There is no mute button for the speakers. I can turn the volume down all the way, of course, but most other keyboards have a separate mute button.<br />- The general tactile feel of the keys is of lower quality.<br /><br />I have no issues with the mouse. It feels solid.<br /><br />I am having real productivity issues with this keyboard and will pass it on to another family member or maybe a media PC. I will switch back to my old keyboard while I look for a better replacement.r />I am having real productivity issues with this keyboard and will pass it on to another family member or maybe a media PC.

I would have to remove the card and would use a wireless N adapter while this card cooled off. It progressively got worse over a couple of months. I upgraded to Windows 7 and had no problem at all with the install and it seemed to have improved somewhat in that it was taking longer before it got hot enough and stopped working. But, it slowly deteriorated in performance and would overheat a bit faster each time I used it. It finally started having performance issues and would overheat in less than an hour and stop working. Eventually stopped using it, as it was very frustrating having it overheat in less than half an hours use. The locking mechanism eventually wore out and it was difficult to get it to stay seated in the slot. I think it may still be under warranty. I used it in an HP Pavilion dx6650us Centrino Duo laptop.

Well i got news for you, you COULD jam all that in there, but it sure as hell won't hold up.

So I thought I\u2019d save time and order three different ones and then choose the best.  Unfortunately, it\u2019s choosing the best of the losers.  I purchased the Amazon Standing Leather Origami case (this is leather?), the Fintie Folio case, and the ProCase Flip Stand Leather Folio Cover with stylus pen (I do like using the stylus).<br />The Fintie says it\u2019s made from durable synthetic leather, which must be pleather because that\u2019s what it feels like.  So it\u2019s a cheaper non-leather version ($15) of the non-leather ProCase Folio ($23) which uses premium synthesized leather and at least looks and feels like leather.  So out of these two, the ProCase wins.  The ProCase comes with a stylus pen although the Fintie does have a loop if you purchase your own stylus. They both operate/fold in the same way. However, I was hoping the ProCase would be my keeper because of the elastic hand strap.  I thought this would be my ticket to solving the issue some many have written about in holding the Kindle while ready in bed.  It\u2019s not. The weight of the Kindle causes floppiness and so the front flap (with Kindle in it) and back flap (with hand in it) can\u2019t meet and be together as one. Also, it\u2019s not that comfortable because your hand would have to be angled like when one is actually reading a book, it\u2019s not perfectly horizontal.<br />So I\u2019m choosing the Origami ($70!) because it does stand well on a table both vertically and horizontally and it\u2019s slim. I like all the other features other reviewers have mentioned.  It does nothing to solve the reading in bed or anywhere else problem, that isn\u2019t a table or desk. It also will not be a protective case. I hope some new choices become available soon.",

First of all, the Logitech software significantly slows down your computer. The device drivers and other associated software runs continuously--even when the web cam is not in use! To see this for yourself (if you have one), open up Task Manager (or download Process Explorer from Microsoft) and watch the CPU usage of their applications. In addition to occupying the computer's CPU for no reason, when the software is running (doing nothing) it is forcing other applications that you ARE using to be kicked out of the CPU's cache--the high-speed memory that is inside the CPU. This means that the other programs have to wait to be reloaded from main memory back into the CPU when they do finally get to run.    Second, the software has a large memory footprint. In other words, it is a memory hog. It occupies 32MB of memory when the camera is not in use. This is a totally ridiculous waste of memory.    Finally, their software is buggy. It has caused multiple \\\\\"Blue Screens of Death\\\\\" on my computer. That is, the BSoD screen actually lists the Logitech driver as the cause of the crash.    All in all, the hardware is nice, but it is totally worthless without software that works without totally destroying all computing power, especially when the camera is not being used.    I recommend AGAINST using not only this specific web camera, but ANY web camera from Logitech as their software has common components, so you are likely to see problems in other web cam drivers from them.",

Many of the more vitriolic appear not to have done any pre-purchase research, as they're stunned to find a feature missing when they try to use it. With a few exceptions the Fire does what it says it will, and does it well. The key is making sure it will do what you're looking for in a small tablet.  As far as features the Fire does not have which others have criticized it for, I personally have no need for 3G, cameras, GPS, or parental controls of any sort. Bluetooth might have been neat, but the lack wasn't a deal breaker for me. What came closest to making it a no-buy for me was the lack of an SD card slot. There are ways around the relatively limited memory (shuffling files between the Fire, a computer, and the cloud, etc.) but with the very large number of .MP3s I have alone it would have been far more convenient to carry a couple of SD cards and swap on the fly (and that doesn't begin to touch on video). I won't go into the reasons why Amazon should/should not add/not add any given feature, as those are being discussed to death already. As I note above, research your purchase and see if it has the features you consider `must-haves' before buying, since what is critical to you may mean nothing at all to someone else.  Speaking of what it does have, there are a few flaws in the Fire's implementation of things. First and foremost is the lack of ability to create collections for ebooks. All your books show up in one contiguous bookcase with no ability to categorize or segregate. Also, there is no ability to read the book description and customer reviews from within the book or bookcase ; you must go back into the store and look up the title. Since I've been on a free book binge for a while now I have several hundred titles in my To Be Read pile, and while the Fire does show covers, the inability to quickly look up a description makes the Fire a clear secondary choice to my Kindle Keyboard as a reading device. This is something many are hoping will be addressed in a future software patch.  Also, while Amazon touted cloud storage space when trying to lessen the impact of the Fire's small(ish) on-board storage space, apart from music the cloud operates more as off site storage than a streaming content source. Pictures and other files can be stored on the cloud, but to effectively be used you need to download them to the Fire in one of a few different ways. Given how seamless the integration of .MP3s is (even .MP3s not purchased from Amazon) it's quite surprising that the non-.MP3 integration is so clunky. Again, something that it is hoped will be addressed in a future patch.  There have been reports of owners having other issues which I've never come across : difficulty connected to a WiFi network, blank/missing pages in some titles, fast battery run down, etc. I can't speak to those as those problems never arose for me. Given the huge number of units sold it's no surprise that there will be rough spots here and there.  In the end I decided to return the Fire, not for any flaw in the unit itself, but that it ended up not filling a need. It did pretty much exactly what I was expecting to, and did most of that exceedingly well, but I found that it fell into a niche of `neat to have, not needed'. And this would hold true for any device in its class (e.g. the Lenovo A1, Nook tablet, etc.). I am a bit disappointed that I couldn't justify the purchase in the end, as it really is a wonderful little device, and the price/liberal return policy at Amazon is hard to beat.  Read what the device has and doesn't have, think about what you're going to want it to do and how you'd use it, and decide from there if the Fire fits. If it has the features you want then it is a very well built, well supported device.",

It makes you want to plug in a cable downward towards the base instead of parallel to it. But once you figure it out, you get the hang of it. The cables don't come out on their own, they seem to stay in tact.  <br /> <br />I was very excited to see that the hub came with a free fly light! It was the first thing I plugged in, but it didn't work! It only flickered on and off. I messed with it and disconnected other usb ports and still nothing. So, that was pretty upsetting.  <br /> <br />The hub comes with a power adapter that is the size of a box of crayons, about 2.5\\\\\" long, 3\\\\\" tall, and 2\\\\\" wide. So, you need to make more room on your power strip for that.  <br /> <br />I plugged in three usb cables at once and they all work just dandy. The hub was plug and play so I didn't install any drivers. I did read, however, that the hub will disconnect certain ports if one port or more are drawing too much power. I connected my external hard drive, drawing tablet, digital camera cable, and printer/scanner. Worked good for me, nothing turned off.  <br /> <br />The manual was a little bare. I wanted to read some more info on the lights on the front of the hub, but it didn't say much about anything in the manual.  <br /> <br />There are seven lights on the front of the hub (one for each port). There are six usb ports on the backside of the hub and one usb port on top of the dome. It's very light, but doesn't move around much as it has little feet to keep it in place.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think it's a great product especially for the price. Too bad the fly light didn't work though.",

One of them has the most frustrating scroll wheel imaginable - it changes direction of the input rapidly while you're scrolling, making it effectively useless. This defect began to appear after maybe a few months of use, then continued to get worse. The other one simply randomly ceased to work after about six weeks of use. A working scroll wheel is pretty much a necessity for me, so these defects have rendered these mice almost entirely unusable for me.  I wanted to like this mouse, but it sucks. I didn't expect the world for $22, but I expected mice which could be used for more than a few months before either showing signs of wear or breaking entirely. After going through multiple cheap mice in the past year or so, next time I will absolutely invest the extra money into a decent mouse. It pays off in the long run. Up until last year, I had used a Logitech MX518 exclusively for the best part of 5 years - now THAT was ~$40 well spent!  The only reason I didn't give this a 1-star rating is because it looks cool.",

The sound is clear and smooth, and it feels comfortable after wearing for a couple hours. The mic quality is solid from what people I've talked to on Skype say, and the overall use of the headset is top notch.<br /><br />However, there are a few things that I had gripes with. The first being that the sound quality is NOT surround sound like advertised. It has a strong base and no way to control that, so listening to music with heavy bass can be a bit ear splitting if you don't turn the volume down. The second and most important grip, is that the headset I received was NOT a &#34;VIPstore&#34; brand, but rather a &#34;SADES&#34; brand. The headset is identical in every way to another product you can find here on Amazon (I won't link to it for courtesy to this seller), and the only different in the images given is that the &#34;SADES&#34; logo was removed from the sides of the headset and USB connector. However, the box that it came in was labeled &#34;SADES&#34;, it was in Chinese, and logos that are not in the image, are there.<br /><br />Overall, the product is a good one and I'd buy it again, but not from this seller, who is clearly selling a different headset than the one listed here, probably at a profit.",

It boots up with Windows 7 64-bit OS in a mere 29 seconds. This is just further proof that the Seagate hybrid disk that I received is indeed defective.  Now I have enough evidence to return this defective part to Seagate.  Original review below:<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />I did not purchase this drive from Amazon, but I would have if it had been in stock.  I installed this 500 GB drive into a relatively new HP laptop computer that came with Windows 7 OS and cost more than $1000.  I wrote down the Windows Experience Numbers with the original Fujitsu 5400 RPM hard drive prior to making the swap. Also, I measured the power up and power down times for comparison.  I used Acronis Easy Migrate to clone the Seagate Hybrid drive. Before cloning the hard drive, I cleaned the registry and triple defragmented the hard drive to make sure everything was optimized. The system powered up perfectly after swapping the hard drives. I powered up and down several times to give the SSD portion of the hard drive a chance to learn from my usage.  I expected Windows 7 to power up faster because my old drive was 5400 RPM and the new one is 7200 RPM.  To my surprise, the boot up time was exactly the same as with the 5400 RPM drive!  I tested it several more times just to be certain and it was consistent.  Well, that was disappointing.  So, I reran the Windows Experience test to determine if that was any better.  I got the exact same numbers as with the 5400 RPM drive.  I double checked to make sure the Seagate drive model number was correct and it was.  So theoretically, I do have the correct disk drive in my laptop computer. I cleaned the registry again and I defragmented again.  No change in performance.<br /><br />I am a fairly accomplished electrical engineer and I build my own high end over clocked Intel i7 systems, so I think I know what I am doing. I checked back over at Newegg's reviews and some people had the same experience as I did.  And then there are others who say they are getting fantastic improvements.  I don't get it.  It is as if my Seagate Hybrid drive's SSD section isn't working.  I do not know how to test the SSD section since it is buried inside the drive.  At least my hybrid drive is very quiet and doesn't vibrate like several people experienced on Newegg.  The only parameter that is faster with this new Seagate Hybrid SSD drive is the power down time.  Power down is about 15 seconds faster.  So at least something is faster.<br /><br />There was no documentation or installation disk of any kind accompanying this disk drive.  I opened the box and there was only the disk drive in an antistatic bag and nothing else.  Of course, now Amazon apparently has this disk drive in stock.  I am tempted to buy another one from Amazon to see if there is any difference. I have considered returning my hybrid drive to Newegg, but I cannot prove it is defective. After all, it does work -- just no better than my 5400 RPM Fujitsu OEM disk drive.  I am clearly disappointed with this disk drive.<br /><br />UPDATE:  July 28, 2010<br /><br />Today I installed this hybrid SSD based disk drive into a Vista-64 desktop computer versus my new HP laptop computer.  Again, there was no improvement in speed whatsoever. This time I took time to measure numerous before and after benchmarks on different applications, and everything was exactly the same as with the original 7200 RPM SATA Seagate disk drive I removed. I opened and closed the applications many times to give the Seagate algorithm opportunity to learn from my usage. I think the SSD portion of the drive is either not working or completely missing.  There is no way to determine if it is working or not except by actual usage.  I think there is a quality control problem at Seagate and they are shoving these things out of the door without adequate testing.  NewEgg customers also have this same experience.  I'm going to leave this disk drive in this old desktop computer because it is too much trouble to try to return since I am in Shanghai, China.  I will wait for the next version to come out before trying this product again.<br /><br />This time I used HDClone Version 3.9 software to clone the old drive.  Originally I used Acronis.  (HDClone costs $44 for a download version.  But it is clearly superior to Acronis.  The feature I like most about HDClone is disk defragmentation on the fly.  This way you are guaranteed to have perfect defragmentation as the new disk is being written.  Also, it allows you numerous more options on partition sizing and partition to disk copying.  But it is more complicated to use.)<br /><br />I think this Seagate SSD hybrid drive is hit or miss.  Either you get one that works or you don't. I firmly believe the disk I received has a non-functioning SSD. About the only benefit from this exercise has been that I have become a near expert in cloning disk drives.his same experience.

For it's price, the specifications are outstanding. But I'm not sure of the component quality and I'm less than happy with the much touted 3 year warranty.<br /><br />Within a few months of purchase, the sound system started acting buggy. The PC is connected to a TV via HDMI. In order for the audio to pass to the TV, the TV had to be turned on for a few minutes prior to the PC being powered on. Checked the cable, TV HDMI input by using another PC and it is definitely something to do this product. Emailed support and was met with a &#34;never heard of this before, did you try a different cable? Type of response. Decided to just always turn in the TV first as a work around.<br /><br />About 1.5 years along, the HDMI has gone out all together and a fan sounds like its about to die. Did all the normal trouble shooting. - ie changing cable, different HDMI input choice, different PC, etc and it's definitely this machine. Opened it up to see if I could just replace HDMI - nope, it's part of either the mother board or card. Not sure as I didn't dig around as I didn't want to void the warranty and I'm not a computer whiz so none of this is instinctive.<br /><br />Contacted support and was told to use an air can to blow out the fan as that's usually the problem with fan issues. And for the HDMI problem, Aaron told me that I'd have to reformat the entire machine since it's probably a bad driver. When I responded with, &#34;no, that's not normal process for a corrupted driver.&#34; Aaron insists that I have to reformat the entire machine first.<br /><br />Um, no.<br /><br />So, if you need a cheap no name PC that works decently for 1.5 years, this will be fine.

As awesome as this thing was and how excited as it was when I first installed it, I am blown away how something with so many useful features could be such a piece of garbage! But, that's just a result of no quality control. First time I booted my PC up after installing, no audio devices would work, except the headphone port in the &#34;Media Dashboard&#34;, the Realtek audio manager showed that both mic and headphone jacks on the unit had something plugged into them, when they most certainly did NOT. No big deal though, just unplugged front panel audio, it's not like I ever use it anyway and my mic is built into my webcam. USB ports worked fine and felt really secure and sturdy, which I liked, but when I tested the card reader it said every Micro SD HC/XC card I tried was &#34;Write Protected&#34;, but blowing out the card slots fixed that and all was good, which is weird enough. I then proceeded to test the IDE/SATA ports, (hard drives used: Maxtor MaxLine III, 250GB, SATA 1, Seagate Barracuda 7200.7, 40GB, IDE/ATA), the first time I plugged the drives in, (not at the same time, of course) they worked like a charm, Windows picked them both up as soon as they initialized, read/write speeds were great, and it seemed like a really cool little gadget, it also looked really good in my case!<br />Later that day... I went to go pull some data off the 40GB before it was to be formatted and its Operating System reinstalled on the PC it belonged to, I plugged the IDE cable into the drive and unit, plugged the power cord into the unit, then into the hard drive, but as soon as I flipped the switch to turn on the power to the hard drive, smoke came off the circuit board on the hard drive, filled the room with &#34;magic&#34; smoke (Hey! You let the magic smoke out, idiot!) and that familiar smell that lets you know &#34;you're f*cked&#34;, my PC also instantly shut off as the power supply's short circuit protection kicked in. (Thank God for that!)<br />I immediately unplugged the hard drive, took it out of its caddy and found the baked circuit. I then unplugged my PC from everything and removed the unit, wishing I could smash it as I removed it, (too bad you have to return the unit in one piece for a refund! Erg!) I'm just glad my PC still boots and everything still works, thanks to that short circuit protection! Oh, it also fried the unit as I plugged it into a device that converts a wall adapter to a molex adapter and NO lights would come on, but when I first received the unit I tested it using the same adapter and it worked fine, so it's not the adapter's problem, and there weren't any pins touching metal, or the PCB of the hard drive touching any metal either, that would make it completely my fault, when it is, indeed the unit's fault.<br />To wrap it all up, don't buy this unit unless you want to risk the life/health of your PC and any hard drives you plug into it, I'm also concerned if it damaged any of the Micro SD HC/XC cards I put into the card reader (SanDisk 32GB Class 10/UHS-1, PNY 64GB Class 10/UHS-1)<br />I'm glad to say I got my refund almost as soon as I shipped it back, but what about the hard drive and data it took along with it? Which I mentioned to them!<br />Thank you for reading, I am glad to share my experience with anyone who plans to buy this so they don't experience what I experienced, one reviewer also claimed that it took out their motherboard AND power supply and caused a fire!

The item wasn't in a bag or any protective sleeve and when they packaged it, the adhesive from the box stuck to the finish of the case.  I didn't rip and tear and after gently pulling, tugging the cardboard came loose with patches of faux leather.  Ok, so that's number one to aggravate me because a brand new product looks like it was chewed by the family pet.<br /><br />So I put the Kindle into it and it really does look and feel impressive and will guard the book just fine.  I decide now I'm going to try out the features.  Standing and tilting, etc.  Well let me tell ya - that velcro they use could secure a small car to a helicopter for aerial transport (and for a damn good distance too!)  What the velcro did for me ?  Frustrated me till I was ready to throw the thing in the trash.  There's velcro all over it and it's a pain in the arse and sticks to other parts - even parts you don't want it attached to at the time.<br /><br />I have a Kindle Fire and the jack goes into the \\\\\"short\\\\\" side - on this model the jack goes into a long side and that's the side that sits on the table when charging.  I don't believe you should charge it when you're working on it.  The charger sticks out the bottom and if you want to tip it up and work on it, it's resting on the charger plug.  So two things can happen.  One, it could damage the plug or the HD's internal slot and two, you could damage your Kindle because the HD tips back and forth because it's not sitting securely when the plug is in.<br /><br />Personally I'd go with one of the book cover types.  I have that type on two others and they work to protect the item and really, the convenience of a smaller, lighter Kindle is for ease in handling and they're portable.  I don't require a cover that will frustrate the hell out of me just to prop upthe item and usually I'm holding it when working on it - so why pay for that option.<br /><br />Overall - it wasn't packaged well enough to protect the finish, you need to be a puzzle master to flip it around and get it in place.  All in all, I'm not impressed with this case and probably wouldn't be with any other made like it.<br /><br />I have photos to post and will do so asap.",

It's fairly cheap molded plastic. I've had real WD (Western Digital) branded hard drives that seem to have nicer manufacturing specs, even though they have plastic enclosures.

For instance, a drive with an aluminum enclose costs only a fraction more to manufacture, but is much nicer in many ways. Nevertheless, I don't downgrade my review because of that.

The interface operates extremely well and the screen looks great. Most technology is not particularly intuitive to me, but I think I've learned most of what I need to know to use the Kindle. That said, what I can do is limited, since 1) I can barely read some Web site pages, and enlarging them doesn't always help since not all online pages are designed to be enlarged for a 7\\\\\" screen; and 2) the apps are thus far pretty dumb. The only two games I play are not available for android (so far...I emailed one and begged them to please develop their android version, and they said it's coming). And the New York Times crossword puzzle, which I've done for 50 years and online for years as well, is not at all ready for android, just iPads, and they didn't want to hear about making one for the Kindle. (Lost income opportunity there, NYT.) And these are the only reasons I rated my Kindle 3 stars...all personal to me.  The Kindle pluses for me: great for reading books, lots of stuff available free when you have Prime, and you can figure out the interface quickly. In the meantime, I am going to wait for the ideal small, light ultrabook, since that will have everything I need to do the fun things I've been doing on a heavy laptop all this time...The ultrabook will probably be from Microsoft, since I have never entered Apple World and I think it's a bit late now after 26 years on Microsoft software.",

The proported speed of 200 Mbps of the kit tracks very nicely with the maximum speed of 802.11n, and it would eliminate any wireless interference issues I might have.    Set up was very easy - just plug one Adapter in a power outlet near the router (make sure you don't plug the adapter into a surge suppressor), plug the other Adapter into a power outlet close to your PC/game console, connect both with the supplied ethernet cables, and away you go! Without any prior set up of software, drivers, etc., both Adapters immediately recognized each other and began to send and receive data! If only other computer peripheral installations were so easy.    There are 3 lights on each Adapter showing the status of the unit. There's a Power light that shows if the unit is receiving power or setting up security protocols, an Ethernet light that shows if the Adapter is linked and if it is sending data, and a Powerline light that shows if the Adapter is connected to the Powerline network, and the approximate Link Rate. Since the XAVB101 version of Netgear's Powerline Adapters should have a maximum transfer rate of 200 Mbps, I was dismayed that the Powerline light glowed RED, signifying a Link Rate of < 50 Mbps. I thought that possibly this status might not be right, so I performed several data-intensive operations, such as adding album art to Apple Lossless music tracks on my ReadyNAS music server. Much to my chagrin, the speed was no better than my wireless 802.11n connection. When I ran an ethernet cable directly from my router to my iMac and performed the same tasks, they ran lightning-fast. Not a true scientific test, but the comparison was dramatic - from just minutes to complete to TENS of minutes.    I tried other power outlets in our house, but they all showed RED for the Link Rate.It may be the wiring in our 50 year old home, but I don't have anywhere else to test the Adapters. In any case, where I NEED to use the Adapters, the throughput is dismal.    So, anyone looking for an easy connection to their network and is not worried about the speed of the connection, then by all means get the NETGEAR XAVB101 Powerline AV Ethernet Adapter Kit. But if you're like me, you need a FAST connection, look to other solutions.",

NOTE:- I ordered it fully loaded with i7 4900MQ processor, 16 Gb RAM, 2Gb Graphics card and 1.5Tb HDD    This is a great laptop, is very fast and can handle any APP and can run multipl APPs at a time with out any time lag or hassel    However there are couple of things one must know before taking the decision  1) This laptop is much much heavier than I expected  2) There is quite a good flex in the keyboard on the left side (the ASDF keys)  3) The keyboards response is random, sometimes it chooses not to accept a key press and if you type fast then be prepared to miss out on some letters - and get into the habit of going back and fixing them regularly  4) The mouse touch pad is large and sensitive - however sometimes it just decides not to respond, you click or double click - its just dead - then it jumps back to life again :)  5) I opted for a bluRay burner, if you leave your system ON for a long time like a couple of days - the Optical drive does not recognize even the most ordinary disc, you need to re-start your system for the disc to be recognized  6) The screen is not very thin - as expected - its as ordinarily thick as of any other laptop, but yeah the display is awesome    If you are using this laptop for regular stuff - it never gets HOT - its very quite and is lovely to work with.    The reason I give 4 starts is it does the job that i bought it for, true it has some glitches and flaws - but is still a great machine    I hope this review would be help full to you all      UPDATE    after about two month of hands-on with this laptop here are the set of Problems I've been facing    1) Extremely bad keyboard - if you are a fast typing person then be prepared for correcting and re-correcting your text. The keyboard tends to skip some letters while you are typing, i lose a lot of time going back and correcting the words and typing in the missing letters. too much flex in the keyboard    2) Mouse pad acts whacky, twice dring the last week it decided not to respond to any clicks, it detects the movement and hovers the pointer all over the screen but does not respond to a single or a double click.(had to roll back the drivers and re-install them)    3) the touch screen decided not to work - (had to roll back the drivers and reinstall them)    Hence if you are a TECHY and you know how to fix such problems that creep up every now and then; then go ahead and pick this beast - else pick something which is hassle free.

            "input": "All in all, I am very pleased with my Kindle 3.     The positive stuff:    The Kindle is designed to do one thing, and do that one thing very well. If what you want to do is read books, a dedicated reader is the way to go. Here is why:    READABILITY: The electronic ink used in the Kindle (and some other readers) has a much higher resolution than a TFT (transistor) display. It really does look like high quality printed text, not like the pixelated characters to which you are accustomed on a cell phone, laptop, or computer screen. As you have doubtless already heard, you can read the e-ink displays in bright sunlight, just like you can a book.    WEIGHT: You know how much a traditional laptop weighs. You probably have or had one. Netbooks are lighter, comparable to a college textbook, but not exactly handy for reading. When the Apple iPad hit the market, there was plenty of chatter on the Internet about it killing the Kindle. Well, I've had an iPad in my hands, and it is a cool device, but it is still too heavy to hold in your hands for a long period, the way you would hold a book or magazine. I can hold the Kindle in one hand for long periods, just as I would hold a paperback.    BATTERY LIFE: My various laptops will run for somewhere between 2 and 4 hours. The batteries on an iPad will keep it going significantly longer, but still not for more than part of a day. The Kindle will go for a week on a single charge, and if you turn off the wireless, except when you wish to order something, it will go for much longer.    Let's say you are sold on the idea of a dedicated reader. Why the Kindle? There are other readers which also use electronic ink, and some which use TFT displays. The Sony readers I looked at in the past suffered from a major design flaw -- too many buttons. You may or may not like the iPad, iPhone, or iPods, but think about what sets them apart from the also-rans -- their simplicity, their no-compromise single-button perfectionism. When I see some touchscreen phone which is a belated attempt to catch up with the iPhone, where the designers could not resist adding a handful of buttons, I just shake my head because they don't get it. A phone, or a reader, which has buttons like your TV remote control, is something you are going to be challenged to learn how to use. The Kindle designers \\\\\"get it\\\\\". The newer Sony readers are getting better, but they are still playing catch-up.     The issues:    PAGING BUTTONS: The Kindle 3 has a smaller frame than the previous versions, for the same sized display, meaning there is less room around the display for buttons. As a result, the buttons on the sides for paging forward and backward really are ON the sides. My hands are big enough for me to cradle the Kindle in a palm, with my fingers wrapping around an edge, where it is easy for me to inadvertently squeeze a button. As a result, I want to instead hold it below the screen, pinched between a thumb and fingertips, but the keyboard buttons below the screen get in the way of doing that. In short, I find it a bit tricky to hold onto with one hand, but I do manage.    PAGING BUTTONS: In order to make the device equally usable if held in the left or right hand, both sides have two paging buttons, for paging forward or backward. The button for paging forward is vertically near the middle, and about twice as large as the button above it for paging backward. So far so good. But when I hold the Kindle in BOTH hands, I find myself instinctively wanting to use the big button on the left side to page backward, and the big button on the right to page forward. But both page forward, so often when I try to back up to re-read a passage, I end up paging forward instead. It is a hard habit to break. I would like to be able to reassign the buttons. Maybe it can be done, but if so, I have not stumbled across how to do it.    NO TOUCH SCREEN: After having an iPod Touch for only a short time, which I use mainly for listening to music, I find myselfwanting to page back and forth on the Kindle by swiping my screen with a finger. It is almost irresistible. Whether a touch screen is compatible with an e-ink display I do not know. How much additional battery drain it might cause, taking away a major Kindle advantage, I don't know either. Whether the fingerprints would make the screen look bad I do not know. But I do know that I would really, really, like a touch screen for navigation. There are other readers which have them, but check to see if those are using TFT screen or e-ink. I would not trade away the e-ink for a touch screen. But sooner or later somebody is going to give me everything in one package.    NO DEDICATED NUMBER BUTTONS: The QWERTY-arranged buttons are in 4 rows. With this iteration of the Kindle, there is no top row containing the number buttons. To enter a numeric character, you must click the Sym button and move the cursor over the digit, and then click the enter button. This is a pain. A row of number buttons at the top (which previous versions actually did have) would be much appreciated. There is enough room for the row, so I don't know why it was taken away.",

            "input": "I got this to replace an extremely old (10+ years) bluetooth USB dongle because I was only getting about a 10 ft range and it would break up constantly. My device (Android LG Nexus 4) has BT 4.0 support so I got this specifically because it was the latest bluetooth version at a reasonable price.  I use several bluetooth devices including 2 cars, a portable bluetooth speaker and this USB dongle I am reviewing. With the bluetooth speaker, I can have my phone in one room and walk 3/4 away across the house transmitting through 4+ walls and it won't even get static. I have a high-powered 3 antenna AC router where my desktop computer is that transmits at the same 2.4gh frequency as device. I can put the speaker at the precise location where this dongle is seated in my computer, then walk half way across the house with the router directly blocking the line of sight between the phone and the speaker and the speaker never has a hiccup or breaks up until I practically get outside the house. The 2 cars have an even better range with the same phone. My wife has dropped me off in our driveway and driven to the mailboxes 100+ft away and the music in my phone is still broadcasting to her car without dropping the connection.  All that being said, out of all the bluetooth devices I have, this is by far the worst performing and most troublesome. I can have my phone resting on my desk less than 3 feet away from the dongle, and I will get massive static occasionally and have to slide my phone a few inches to get it to clear up (as though I were adjusting bunny ears on a TV). If I take my phone into the bathroom literally 4-6 feet away through one wall (with no metal in it), the audio breaks up so much its not even worth using it.  If I didn't use it with so many other bluetooth devices, I might think my phone is at fault or the location. But I have tested positioning my phone / bluetooth speaker in the exact same locations. I am actually work at a tech support call center troubleshooting all smart phones available on the USA market including bluetooth issues. I have tried unpairing the phone and computer (removed the device completely from both the computer and the phone) then repairing. I have gone so far as to change channels on my router and even have tried turning off the router. I have uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers. I tried to look online for an update, but this company has HORRIBLE support (or complete lack thereof). They don't have USB drivers or even a support tab on their website. I tried to change USB ports to my front ports (which I use 10+ other devices without issue) and this piece of junk won't even work on any of them after reinstalling the drivers / power cycling my computer.  I have also tried switching to USB 3.0 ports on the back of my computer.  I also tried connecting my old iPhone 4 to this. I get better range (maybe 50% more) and less static but get massive lag when trying to pause/play the music (I press pause and it takes 5+ seconds to pause) and the audio stream speeds up (music sounds high pitched / chipmunk voices) or slows down (deep voices / slow motion voice).  All this may be excusable if there was better support or some way to update the drivers. I am very organized when it comes to driver discs (which are going completely out of style and will disappear in the next 10 years) so I was able to find the disc in my CD binder when I came back to troubleshoot this again. When I plug it in, it does not automatically find the drivers on my Windows 7 64 bit computer. So what if I were to lose the disc for this?  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I happen to be in a situation where I can place my phone within 2 feet of the dongle with little inconvenience, find a sweet spot, and have only very occasional static. But I originally intended this to have the same range as my other bluetooth devices so I could walk around the house with my wireless headset with the phone in my pocket listening to music or evenaccepting phone calls through my headset.  Edit: I started futzing with this again so I returned to this product's Amazon page to see if I could find some better drivers. I see that 5-6 people are taking the time to mark all the 5 star reviews helpful and any negative review unhelpful. Whoever is selling this product is taking the time to mark my highly detailed review as unhelpful but can't provide any comment or troubleshooting tips. I am lowering my rating to a 1 but wish I could make it lower somehow. I really hate companies who manipulate Amazon reviews.",

Especially if you're used to a laptop.<br /><br />First, all the good stuff about ASUS. This Chromebook is really very well built. Looks very nice, is light yet fells strong, very good keyboard and track pad. In fact I'm typing this review on the Chromebook! Although I just realized there's no delete, home or end keys! Still the keyboard is not bad. The other features include built-in webcam, HDMI output, SD card slot, USB slot, earphone/mic jack. The battery life is amazing. I charged the battery the first time (and it was quite quick) a few days ago. And with light usage (about an hour each day) I've been running on battery ever since, almost a week now! In short, ASUS did an excellent job with this Chromebook.<br /><br />But are you ready for a Chromebook to begin with? That's the bigger question. You can read a lot on the web about the differences between the following:<br />1) Laptop: Most expensive. Heaviest. Most versatile with software, apps, productivity.<br />2) Chromebook: About the cheapest. Light. Least amount of apps (can only download for Chromebook. Note: Chromebook does not run Android OS).<br />3) Tablet: Cost is somewhere between Chromebook and Laptop. Runs Android OS (or IOS for Apple tablets).<br />4) SmartPhone: This is a different category, but should be considered since a Smartphone starts to perform almost all the functions a laptop can perform. It's the lightest of all, and either runs Android OS or IOS for iPhone.<br /><br />So here's my first impression with the Chromebook.<br />Web browsing: Very fast. That's primarily what a Chromebook was built for - fast web browsing using Chrome. But note - you cannot download Firefox or Internet Explorer. Still, the speed with which pages open up and the navigation is very good and overall you're going to like browsing the internet with this Chromebook.<br />Apps: Not good. I have an Android phone and I'mused to the apps on Android. E.g. I can download Skype on my Android phone. But not on Chromebook. This was a big negative for me. You have to use Chromebook apps like hangout, etc. for the equivalent of Skype. Chromebook tries to overcome for this problem by making other apps that import your Skype contacts, etc. But they're not the real deal.<br />Productivity (like document editing, etc.): Okay. You can use Google docs. But remember that the Chromebook has limited hard drive space. They pretty much want you to use Google drive (cloud based storage). Which can be good or bad depending on your point of view.<br /><br />Overall I don't think I'm ready to switch over to Chromebook. I still use my Laptop for Office email (Outlook), Skype and other software that can't be run on Chromebook. But I do use my Chromebook if all I want to do is browse the web. Still, I can do that on my phone as well! Maybe as I play some more with Chromebook (and as they add more apps) I might change my mind. And I hope it does change one day soon!<br /><br />So if you're familiar with Chromebook and know its limitations, I'd recommend this ASUS one, it's great. But if you're not sure about Chromebook versus a tablet or a laptop, I'd probably wait or go with something other than a Chromebook. Hope this helps. Good luck!",

The down arrow key fell off.  Normally not a huge thing but with the current operating system it is required to scroll through websites.  Because my computer is 13 months old, exactly one month out of warranty I have to pay to have it repaired.  Also, what I thought was a blown speaker was actually the bearings going out of the coolling fan.  Grand total for a new keyboard and fan with labor $426!!  I even called Apple to see if I could get a little customer appreciation to no avail.  Stated it was normal wear and tear.  I'm writting this on my 06 model so I don't think that is the case or shouldn't be the case for a $1200 computer.  I am terribly disappointed in today's Apple.  Before making the leap, please research the repair issues I've stated, I am not the only one.  The internet is full of these same issues and the same response from Apple.

Logitech improved that feature and more with this newer version of the same camera that came out in July. I was excited to see that they had changed that among other things! Just like my original quickcam pro, this one has the stand, which is good for sitting your cam when you aren't using it to clip on the top of your notebook. I have a toshiba 17\\\\\" laptop, and this cam fits perfectly on the top of it. Have dark rooms? No problem... the low light technology on this webcam is the best I've seen. Over the course of 5 years, I have bought about 4 webcams and this cam by far is the best in dark room settings. The previous quickcam pro I have works great too... I use this cam to talk to friends on aim, and they have ichat. Works great. They can't believe all I have on my desk is one lamp on the low setting and they can see me perfectly clear, when they have to turn on all the lights in their room so I can see them! Another thing too is the 2 megapixel video .. it's pretty awesome. And you can take photos in 8 megepixels! There aren't many webcams out there that do that. If you buy a webcam with a 1 megapixel video or lower, you get what you pay for and it's going to look awful.<br /><br />One thing about this camera, which I just asked the logitech customer support on their message boards about, is about the frame rate. It's supposed to be up to 30 frames, yet this one seems a bit slow. My other quickcam pro didn't seem to have any problems with the frame rate, yet this one does for some reason. It's almost a ghostly effect when you move. Which really isn't that big of a deal, but it would be nice if it didn't have that or you could adjust how fast it picks up the images it captures. Or maybe it's just a problem on my computer's end. Other than that this camera works great and I would recommend it to everyone.",

To make a long story short, spent 7 hours of my Sunday troubleshooting by myself, with Apple Tech, finally went to apple store at 4 PM and they discovered the HDE Mini DisplayPort to VGA adaptor was bad. Replaced with Apple adaptor, and everything works perfectly.<br /><br />The lesson? I try to save money when I can ($9 for the HDE vs. $29 for the Apple), but in this case it bit me in the tookis, and ruined my Sunday. I will probably continue to use inexpensive cables and adaptors (Monoprice is terrific), but occasionally you pay a high price for frugality. C'est la vie.",

Once they freeze, you have to restart them from the power button. It seems to be some problem with the wireless network card/configuration. I've seen reviews about freezing also with the Happy2 line of Acer.  I finally bought a purple Gateway LT2804u which is the dual core Gateway equivalent of AOD257. Gateway was bought by Acer so they have very similar specifications but the Getway doesn't freeze. It is very responsive and works perfectly while networking.

It has been about 2 weeks since I ordered this, and it seems to work smoothly with my computer, and for the price, I would definitely order this again! I might stock up considering how quickly I go through power cords (I bend them, the plastic breaks, wires break = no more power). Finally, I paid for UPS Ground shipping to get it faster, and the seller took over 24 hours processing time, but I got it quickly.<br /><br />Downsides: it is a bit short, wish the seller would put the length in the description, I'd say 5-6 feet long which isn't much for a good cord. Also the adapter label does not say it is 90W, so you have to remember for next time. Finally, the connection seems to fit fairly well and hold well in my computer, but it still pops out easily. But that is true even for Dell cords. And the cord itself seems thinner than the Dell cords, I'm not sure if that is good or bad.<br /><br />Verdict: I would definitely order another! I can't believe I paid $80+ last year for a Dell cord that only lasted me 1 year (they are more expensive and unavailable now from Dell's website), when this one costs $7 + shipping and works well.",

I paid for the box and today it arrived. There weren't any instructions in the box and only one small piece of foam so that the computer would be moving around in the box and more than likely end up broken. I decided to look up complaints on Toshiba and found an astounding number of complaints about Toshiba and their customer service.Many people were complaining that they were supposed to receive a box to return their computer in but never received anything. They didn't mention being forced to pay $25.94 like I had to do. I guess the payment for the box is new and expensive. I also found complaints about hard drives failing in short periods of time. I have only had my computer for 3 months and I bought it new.There were also complaints about the year long warranty not being honored for the full year. I received an email from Toshiba saying that I must return the computer by a date in June or they won't fix it and yet my warranty is good for a year.<br /><br />I called Toshiba and they said they will send me yet another box. However they did not send me an email confirming this as they did the first time. This leads me to suspect that I may not get a box as people have been complaining about on the internet. I am going to call them on Monday and ask for an email about the box. Should the box not arrive in two working days as the first box did then I will file a complaint with my state attorney generals office and also complain about the June deadline they gave me for getting the computer there. I think I actually will complain to the attorney general office anyway. Why should I have a deadline to send it to them? I only bought this computer because I bought a Toshiba lap top about 5 years ago and never had problems with it.  I was supposed to get a free upgrade to Windows 7 for this older computer and sent in the request for it. I contacted them the day after the deadline to send it in and they said they never received it and wouldn't give me my upgrade. It was apparently a mistake to buy a Toshiba again.

Following the instructions, I attempted to install the software before plugging the camera in. In fact, I downloaded the latest software (v 8.4.6 build 1016A) from the Logitech website first. The initial attempt to install failed during the process to install the drivers. It loaded  several files and then attempted to \\\\\"Uninstall Device\\\\\" (?!!?). The Logitech program it tried to run, DELDEV.EXE, died, generating a system warning (ie. \\\\\"Device Removal Module Died! Send Report To Microsoft ?\\\\\"). It then retries, dies, retries, dies, forever. Had to finally kill the install process in the Task Manager. Nice.  <br /> <br />In looking on the Logitech Support website, they recommend doing a \\\\\"Clean Boot Process\\\\\" prior to install. This involves running the utility, MSCONFIG, and doing a \\\\\"selective startup\\\\\", turning off all Windows configuration files and all Windows Services and rebooting the machine. Jeez, I've never had to do this with any other software installation -- ever! Seems excessive and burdensome, especially for a USB device. But, I tried it. I had the same installation failure. I tried doing this again, but clearing out all temp files first (another suggestion). No go.  <br /> <br />I've spent hours pouring over the Logitech Knowledge Base and User Discussion Groups. I haven't found a good solution. But I've seen lots of discussion of folks having problems with XP Service Pack 2. Some folks report success with XP SP2, but there are also a lot of folks having a frustrating time. Looks like the QuickCam software is not completely stable/reliable under XP Service Pack 2. Waiting to hear back from Logitech Tech Support -- but I'm not holding my breath for a speedy resolution. <br /> <br />I've just about given up. I went into the Control Panel/Add-Remove Programs utility to clean up the *partially* installed QuickCam software. The Uninstall program for the QuickCam software dies with an exception in SetupDLL/SetupDLL.cpp(454) (ie. line 454 of the C++ code for SetupDLL). So I've got this crappy, half-installed software I can't clear out of my system. Gosh, thanks Logitech.  <br /> <br />I know people are using this camera successfully and getting great results. But I can't get past the initial software install (haven't even plugged the camera in the USB port yet). I would recommend that anyone considering purchasing this camera for XP Service Pack 2 first visit the Logitech support website, and search through the Knowledge Base and the User Discussion Groups. <br /> <br />Disappointed, John",

I would suggest not trying to stick a two port graphics card into this machine. It can be done however.   3) Most Importantly I got this machine for $300 dollars less at Office Max. That was a steal. This is about average.    I would not recomend this computer to someone who is timid about throwing in new parts. I would however highly recommend this computer to people who are not afraid of getting their hands dirty. What makes this computer great is that it is an excelent base to build upon with it having a 750 Gig harddrive and 8 gigs of ram. After getting a new power supply, a new (single port) graphics card, and two monitors, this computer was transformed into a beast which I can play the latest games at the highest settings and do heavy 3D work.

When everything was set up, the system booted up as expected, the problem was that if you let the machine go to sleep or shut down via the software shut down in windows 7, it would never wake up until you removed power from the motherboard. This was done by turning the power supply switch off for a few seconds and then back on. At this point it would boot normally and repeat the same problem.<br /><br />Here is when the larger problem began. I contacted Asus tech support (this turned out to be the most disappointing experience) and they had me do several checks, even suggesting the power supply was bad (it worked fine on another Mfr's motherboard and it is more than adequate at 750W). After several emails back an forth they ran out of dumb ideas and suggested sending it in for repair to there facility in Jeffersonville, IN. They issued an RMA number and to ship it to them at my cost of $22 . I sent it off and approximately 2 weeks later, the same board was returned to me. After installing the same components that were previously connected to the motherboard, it now failed to boot at all!  It had a momentary red LED light flash indicating a problem with the processor so I re-seated it, same light flashed when trying to start the machine and then nothing except for a green LED on the board that lights up when power is applied from the power supply. I again tried the processor in another manufacture's motherboard and again it worked fine. I'm sure they never tested the board or they would have found the same issue.<br /><br />The real insult that was most aggravating was the call to tech support to advise them of the failed &#34;repair&#34;  and then they suggested that I pay $10 non refundable processing fee along with a credit card number (to insure I returned the failed motherboard) and they would ship me a different &#34;repaired&#34; motherboard. The $180 charge to my credit card would be refunded when I returned my original piece of junk.<br /><br />My advice to you, if it doesn't work send it back to Amazon immediately and either get you money back or an exchange. Since I elected to screw around with Asus &#34;repair&#34; service, I passed the window on my ability to return it Amazon and now I'm held hostage by Asus if I ever want a working motherboard.<br /><br />Asus needs to review their return/repair policy as they are far from the best when it comes to Customer Service!!!",

I picked it after all, didn't I?). <br /> <br />XD is definitely best, if you definition of best includes: <br /> <br />- Very high rates of corrupted and lost images <br /> <br />- Short life (one XD card I purchased only worked about three times then died and this seems to have happened to others as well) <br /> <br />- Double or triple the cost (and this is getting even worse as SD memory is heavily discounted due to competition). <br /> <br />Of course XD cards are so cute and tiny and that counts for something right?  Sorry, mini/micro SD cards are MUCH smaller, won't TRASH your images, and come with this snazzy adaptor that let's you also use them in full sized SD devices as well. <br /> <br />To make matters worse, XD seems to be going the way of BETA video tapes (with even the idiots who thought it up abandoning it). <br /> <br />If you are fortunate enough to have a camera that can also use an alternative memory format like CF or SD (as is the case with some Fuji and Olympus offerings), then I HIGHLY recommend thatyou used them and stay away from XD, and if you are considering a new camera purchase, I would warn you NOT to purchase a model which can only use XD memory (I certainly never will). <br /> <br />For the benefit of those that ARE stuck with XD, here are some tips: <br /> <br />- Go slow when changing to another capacity card (256k to 512k or 1G) <br />  <br />- Go slow when changing to another vendor (Fuji vs. Olympus) <br /> <br />- Go slow when changing to another type (M vs. H) <br /> <br />- Go slow when trying to use external card readers (probably better NOT to use them at all) <br /> <br />With the definition of \\\\\"Go slow\\\\\" above being that you should not shoot any pictures that you actually care about until you have done enough test shots to make sure you are not going to loose everything you shoot (because every one of the above issues can cause trouble). <br /> <br />I have never given a \\\\\"1\\\\\" rating to ANYTHING on Amazon, but the only reason XD doesn't rate a ZERO is Amazon's ratings do not go that low. <br /> <br />The lame justification used by the Fuji/Olympus cartel for monopolizing the manufacture of these cards was so they could insure compatibility and control quality, but the reality is that it was just about ripping off consumers with much higher prices (because, as far as I can tell, XD cards seem to have MORE compatibility issues and other `lost picture' problems than ANY other type of memory storage card). <br /> <br />As much as I despise frivolous litigation, I would love to see a bunch of XD card users who have lost all their irreplaceable vacation photo's (from say, Europe or Africa), get together in a class action and SUE Fuji (NOT just for the cost of a replacement card, but for the full cost of their vacations).",

Fast forward to early April 2014 and discovered that one of the three metal prongs inside the power brick port, where you plug in the AC cord, had broken off and was now stuck inside the connection plug of the AC cord. Surprisingly, the break point wasn't a clean fatigue-like snap like most breaks in small metal parts. Rather, it was rough and uneven, as if a (possibly pre-existing) crack had formed in the metal prong itself, and had eventually grown enough for the prong to give way and break off completely, giving the impression that very brittle metal was used in its manufacturing.<br /><br />Was about ready to share my views about this on Amazon, when I noticed that PWR+ has an 18 month warranty for their chargers sold on Amazon, and decided to put that warranty to the test. Viewing other negative reviews here at Amazon showed that PWR+ often commented on these reviews, wishing to get in touch with the negative reviewers and posting their Customer Service contact info so the reviewer could do so. Contacted PWR+ using this info, stated my problem, and received a very quick response asking me to send in the charger, and they would immediately send a replacement. Was pretty impressed with this response and sent in the broken charger using pricier yet trackable Priority Mail, as suggested by both their email response and their official product website. Received my replacement charger within 4 days and would have been very happy about it, except right out of the box there was a problem. After a few minutes of trying to get the charger to power my laptop without success, I decided to switch the AC cord that plugs into the power brick with an AC cord from another laptop as a test, and sure enough the laptop began charging. Switched back to the replacement charger's AC cord and again, no charge.<br /><br />After having one PWR+ charger essentially break apart after 6 months and it's replacement charger having a bad AC cord right out of the box, I can't wholly recommend PWR+ products to anybody considering them. The fact that I wasn't reimbursed on return shipping costs for the first busted charger doesn't help any, even though previous reviewers who have dealt with PWR+ customer service apparently were (look for a review posted on February 5, 2014 and another on November 7, 2013 for examples). Which is too bad, because the original charger worked great for the brief time that it did. And Customer Service was very friendly and seemed interested in resolving my problem almost immediately. But after the first one went bust and its replacement arrived with a problem of its own, it's obvious they just aren't built to last, and good customer service can't save that.r /><br />After having one PWR+ charger essentially break apart after 6 months and it's replacement charger having a bad AC cord right out of the box, I can't wholly recommend PWR+ products to anybody considering them.

This is what you need to know if you are an EXTREMELY fussy buyer, like me:<br /><br />Gray-Scale:<br />While the gray-scale is very good, it CLIPS all data below and above standard RGB profiles. If you need an extremely accurate monitor for photo or video editing, move on, you will not be satisfied. However, if you can get away with a monitor that is \\\\\"good enough\\\\\", then you should seriously consider the 2370.<br /><br />Color Profile Setup:<br />I initially started setup of the monitor with DVE Blu-ray 1080p using PowerDVD Ultra Mark II, which leads back to the gray-scale. While the monitor performs well, it does have some artifacting and skews to red on the scale. It took considerable tweaking of the OSD, which is very good, to START to CALIBRATE the monitor. However, I also needed to run Samsung's freely available \\\\\"NATURAL COLOR PRO\\\\\" app to get a correct blue hue, and tame those reds.<br /><br />Brightness and Contrast:<br />Unfortunately, the brightness control does not control the gray-scale. It controls the AMPLITUDE. This is the primary reason why the monitor is so difficult to calibrate. Also, this is an extremely bright monitor, and you will be spending time trying to find the correct brightness vs. contrast ratio without affecting true blacks.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />I wanted a solid monitor for gaming, non-professional photo and video editing, and productivity work. Overall, it is highly unlikely you will find a monitor this decent at this price point. If you need better color accuracy and a near-perfect gray-scale, you will want to look at the Dell Ultrasharp 24\\\\\" IPS; however, the monitor is $600. I am waiting for wider availability of 120Hz monitors, so this is an excellent choice to hold me until then.<br /><br />I hope that helps the \\\\\"picky\\\\\" customers, like me, to determine if this monitor suits your needs. One final note, I am using an EVGA 470 GTX card, and I found that DVI-D was the best way to go. Depending on your card, your mileage will vary.hold me until then.

I had to clip one of the tachometer leads on each one so that the fan controller software could accurately report their RPM (as this brand's splitter is designed primarily to plug into PSU connectors, not motherboard ports). When looking through the clear plastic on the side panel of my case, both of these splitters also instantly stand out against my black interior illuminated by blue and white LEDs, making them an eye sore. I recommend them, though, if you simply want to plug your fans into a single shared PSU connector. 4/5<br /><br />NOTE: if you want to plug your fans into a motherboard port, I recommend using a brand's splitter with the second tachometer lead already disconnected and the leads discreetly concealed (such as [[ASIN:B00B46XKKQ Silverstone Tek Sleeved PWM Fan Splitter Cable (CPF01)]]).",

The main drawback to this monitor is that it only has VGA and DVI connections and does not have a HDMI connection. VGA connections, which are of moderate sharpness, will be out of use in a year or so. DVI connections - which are supposed to be a little better - will be out of use in about three years, and will be totally replaced by HDMI, which is in use now. And HDMI is supposed to be much sharper than DVI. Soooo, if you plan to use this monitor for many years, or you want the sharpest monitor you can find, pass this up and get one with a HDMI connection.    Jack",

For starters, this would have exceeded five stars for me if it would not have gotten lost in the mail. Yes, I know this is a \\\\\"product\\\\\" review, but I think the sellers who make the product, not Amazon, choose how they ship their products and if you pick the cheapest shipping for this, they will deliver it via post office and not ups. This resulted in my package getting hung up in Atlanta. After a week or so, I called Amazon to make them aware of this, and they said that I had to wait over a month for it to be considered lost in the mail and for a replacement to be shipped. I was VERY disappointed since the router I was replacing only put out a 15 foot signal. After the torturous waiting period, I called Amazon again to let them know that I still had not received my router. They promptly sent me a replacement and it arrived (still via the post office) in a few days. My husband was confused on how to set it up, but I got it up and running without a hitch the next morning. I think my husband tried installing it with the disc, but it is easier to follow the directions and hook it up over the internet. Here's the kicker... I have multiple wireless devices and have counted at least 8 devices running on this router at one time with little to no lag. My house is a smaller to average size at just under 1500 square feet all on one story. Also, my kindle fire picks up a signal anywhere in my yard which is about a quarter acre. This being said, the router definitely met my expectations. What happened to the first router I ordered? Well, of course, it came to my house a few days after I received my replacement router. I called Amazon to tell them this, but instead of returning it, I was so impressed that I just had them charge me for it so I could give it to my mother since she didn't have a wireless router. She doesn't have many wireless devices, but I wanted her to have one in case I brought my Kindle or my son brought his laptop to her house. Again, easy to set up and works beautifully. Finally, the computers at my work kept getting kicked off line and had a lot of problems communicating to each other (there are eight computers in our network). I told my boss that the old g router was probably the problem and recommended this router. She is a prime member (I have become one since), and received her router within two days. As soon as I switched routers, all of the computers picked right up on the signal, except the main server. I called customer service and, though they were nice, they couldn't help me with my problem and said that it was probably because our cinder block walls were too thick. Since the computer three feet away and in the same room as the main server was working fine, I didn't see how that was the problem. I called our I.T. guy, and he fixed the problem right away. It was a security issue and had nothing to do with the routers signal strength at all. Since we have been using this router, there have not been ANY issues like there were with the old g router.<br /><br />I highly recommend this router. I also highly recommend that you spend a little more money on shipping (if you are not a prime member) to avoid the problem I had. Five stars on the product itself, but three stars on total customer experience.se I brought my Kindle or my son brought his laptop to her house. Again, easy to set up and works beautifully.

In Peer-to-Peer, the channel option becomes available. Also, the reception quality seems heavily dependent (indoors) on which direction the adapter is pointed. This would at first seem to be a non-issue, except that the cord is quite a bit heavier than the adapter. Therefore, when placing it on a desk, you have to very careful to place it in such a way that the cord does not pull it onto the floor.

Kindle is an incredible machine for comfortable reading of available books with the exception of images and story-related maps. This flaw prevents one from easily flipping to the 'map' page and relating story to location. Perhaps the Dx is better for fine images and maps but then one loses convenience of size and portability.

It is true that if you leave the keyboard idle for more than 5 minutes, then it will shut off by itself, which is probably the biggest downside. However, it is easy to turn the device back on, and I wouldn't consider it too big of a problem. It is slim, portable, and very convenient to take around with you, and I honestly think I will be using it in class everyday. It's a great product for a great price! I highly recommend it!

            "input": "I've had this for two days so these are my initial observations<br />The reasons why it's not a 5 star case:<br />It has a vertical crease running top to bottom on the front cover. I know this is like this because it's designed to fold back when using it as a stand, but since this case is first and foremost a case and secondarily a stand, the vertical crease takes away from the rigidity of the case and it sort of buckles out when the case is closed so that the front is not flat, but making a slight outward bend at the crease. As a result, i think this lessens the efficacy of the magnets that help keep it closed.<br /><br />Additionally, to expand on the magnetic closure, the bottom magnet does it's job but the one on the top seems much weaker.<br /><br />The stand feature is adequate but it's flimsy. When using it, its best to place it on a flat, solid surface that doesn't move. I don't really like the stand feature but it does work, just not very well.<br /><br />I do want to try the tablet out with a capacitive stylus and I noticed when buying this case, it came with a pen holder. It's very small and will only fit a pencil or skinny pen. I do not think the stylus I bought will fit in it.<br /><br />Now for the pros:<br />The material that it is made out of looks and feels great and maybe more importantly, doesn't smell at all. The stitching on my case looks very good and I didn't notice any stitiching coming loose. The tablet is secured tightly on the right hand inside flap. It slides in towards the right edge of the flap and there is a tab that tucks behind the tablet on the left side of the tablet to secure it from sliding out. So far, it has stayed in place.<br /><br />The magnets feature an auto sleep on/off feature when you open and close the case. And it works very well. Pretty intuitive and despite claims of some nexus 7 cases putting the tablet to sleep when folding the case back to hold in one hand, this doesn't happen with the poetic case.<br /><br />Thecase doesn't fold back flat because of the case spine on the left side. However, it doesn't really take away from the usability of the case in that respect. There is a vertical elastic strap on the inside left flap that you can slip your hand into for extra security when holding the tablet with the case folded backwards. Time will tell if it holds it's elasticity. But so far, it's nice to use.<br /><br />I also like the credit card/ business card holders on the inside left flap. I took some index cards and cut them down to size to fit in there for pencil and paper note keeping if I need to. There's also a pocket behind the business card holders that you can slip papers, receipts or whatever you need to temporarily. Additionally, you can use the space behind the tablet as a place to store some papers. It's very tight though and you may risk stretching it out if you do put stuff behind the tablet.<br /><br />I'm guessing I'll need to eventually use an elastic band or something to keep it shut when the magnets fail. it just doesn't seem to have a strong attraction. But you know what, it's okay because I only spent 12 bucks on it. As long as it protects the tab from a fall or two, keeps the screen clean when not in use and looks good while doing so, I won't complain.<br /><br />I wouldn't spend more than 15 bucks on this product.

The copying or synchronization of a small number of files worked well, but below the expected speed of even USB 2.0, leave away that of USB 3.0. However, the copying of a large number of files (either through File Explorer or through a Synchronization Software) would invariably freeze up my computer, often for hours at a time.

And, my computer is nice and powerful - it has a Core-i7 processor, 8 GB RAM and has a high-speed internal hard drive. So, the computer hardware was not the thing that can be blamed for these freezing up issues. All, I could do to shut down the computer was to hold the power button down and \\\\\"hard\\\\\" shut down the OS. This freezing happened at least 3-4 times.

From recent reviews, it seems that they have decreased in quality. Because of that, I looked at Corsair cases. They are a reputable brand in the computer component industry and I\u2019ve never had a product of theirs I didn\u2019t like. I listed the components of my build with this case at the bottom. This review contains my initial impression after building my computer yesterday. Hopefully you will find it helpful to sift through the multitude of cases available on the market today.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice case. It is pleasing aesthetically and the brushed aluminum finish on the front is a nice touch. It houses a lot computer in a nicely sized mid-tower case. It has tool-free SSD, hard drive, and optical drive installation. It has 165mm of room for a CPU cooler which will fit my favorite fan and heat sink, the Hyper 212 Evo. The lack of room for cable management behind the motherboard is the main reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. Proper cable management is critical when building a computer and though possible, it was difficult to achieve with this case. That being said, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I would recommend it to a friend with the caveat that it will take them a long time to route the cables properly.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Lightweight nicely sized mid-case.<br /><br />-Great airflow, especially with the 3.5\u201d HDD cage removed. This was important for my hot overclocking build. There is room for 240mm radiator in the front with a nice and cool push/pull fan setup.<br /><br />-2 SSD slots behind the motherboard. This is a great feature and I expect lots of case manufacturers will begin to use this location for SSDs. It allows the removal of front hard drive cages and locates the SSD drives and cables out of sight.<br /><br />-Magnetic dust filters on bottom and top. This will keep the case cleaner no matter where you mount your intake fans (unless you reverse the rear case fan). Front removable panel has filter in front of the intake fans.<br /><br />-Plenty of room for 2 large GPU cards in SLI<br /><br />-Large window on side (if you want to see your setup).<br /><br />-Comes with decent, quiet Corsair fans (2x-140mm, 1x-120mm). I replaced my two front fans with Corsair Air Series AF140 LED Quiet Edition High Airflow Fan - Red (CO-9050017-RLED) fans and couldn\u2019t be happier with their silent operation. I changed them only because I wanted Red LEDs in my front fans.<br /><br />-Bottom Mount Power Supply. This allows the PSU to pull air from and vent to the outside of the case adding minimal heat load to your system. (Admittedly common anymore, but it is still nice to keep the PSU cooling system separate from the case).<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Needs more room for cable routing or at least a vertical channel that protrudes into the case for the large ATX Board wires. It only needs an additional half-inch either way. I would be willing to take a reduction in internal case or desk space for this.<br /><br />-2 SSD slots behind the motherboard do not have room for the Corsair multiple SATA connector power cables unless you use the very end of the cable. I couldn\u2019t get the mid-cable connections to fit behind the case cover with the other cables. It bulges the case side slightly, but not enough to permanently deform it.<br /><br />- When an Optical Drive is installed, it leaves and awkward recess in the smooth brushed aluminum fascia. This is a disparity in this otherwise great looking case. I think Corsair should supply an adapter plate that matches the fascia to fill in the recess around the drive. I\u2019ll post pictures.<br /><br />-Hard drive cage is flimsy and came warped. I was able to square it with just a little pressure from my hands. To me, this shows a lack of quality assurance. It belongs in a $30 case and not in a $120 case. I\u2019m not using it, so it\u2019s nota big deal for me.<br /><br />-The sides of the case are a little flimsy. There are cases in the same price range that have sturdier sides. The sides are flimsy enough that they are hard to mount to the case. When you attempt to seat it and slide it forward you get tabs that won\u2019t catch. The window side is better because the plastic window actually stiffens the side up.<br /><br />-The front panel contains a dust filter and is pretty sturdy, but the plastic latches that hold it in seem very weak.<br /><br />As I said above, I really like the case overall and I\u2019m sure it will provide me years of nice, quiet, cool computing.<br /><br />My Build:<br /><br />Asus X99-Pro<br />Intel Core i7 5820k<br />Corsair H105 liquid cooler<br />4 x 4Gb Corsair Vengeance DDR4-2666<br />Intel 730 series SDD<br />Corsair HX850i PSU<br />2x EVGA GTX 970 GPUs in SLI",

The picture was accurate and showed this quite well.<br /><br />The shell is quite hard, and offers excellent protection from pressure and moderate bumps (not sure how it would hold up with drops...).  There is a little extra space for one or two additional cables of similar size to the one that comes with the hard drive.  Given that, everything is still extremely secure in both pockets.<br /><br />The zipper is shielded from the inside of the case to avoid scratching - a good design technique.<br /><br />My largest criticism for this case is that there isn't much padding.  There is a very thin protective layer that composes the orange material, but it's about 1 millimeter thick and doesn't act well as padding.  Because of this, I wouldn't count on exemplary drop protection.  Also, there is minimal padding protection between the two sides.  I could see sharp objects (especially cable heads) from the screened pocket scratching a hard drive.  Also, the fit for the hard drive a little tight in either pocket, making it a wee bit difficult to remove or insert.  On the other hand this does offer a very secure fit.  Because of the fitting issues, but mostly for the lack of a more protective divider inside the case, I don't think this case quite deserves 5-stars.<br /><br />WD offers a case (which has been criticized as being more accurately represented as a sleeve) that is softer and smaller, but it doesn't offer the same level of crush/pressure protection that this one does.  Because the Amazon case is larger, it's doesn't fit an average size pocket well.  As a size comparison: the WD case fits inside the Amazon case with the hard drive and USB cable present inside itself.  The fit is tight though and I wouldn't doing this recommend this for practical use.<br /><br />Bottom line: this case does what isadvertised to do.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the WD edition.  I'm still satisfied with this edition - the WD case just better suits my needs (the small size of the WD case is really nice).  I'd recommend this case for anyone looking for the extra protection.  The 4 stars are well earned.  I'd give 4.25 stars if possible.",

Since I have an auxilary input option with RCA inputs in my console/arm rest with a 2nd power outlet placed right next to them, a bluetooth adapter such as this seems like the ideal option for wireless connectivity.  I did need to purchase a power adapter since it only comes with an AC wall option out of the box, but fully expected that going into the purchase.  Sound was great and and even though I did purchase a RCA cable with a ground loop isolator in anticipation of that being an issue, it was almost negligible using Monster Cables without any filter.  Was barely noticeable under nearly all situations which was very surprising from past attempts I've made at using this same auxilary input for other playback sources in conjuction with the power supply in the console.<br /><br />Sadly, I decided to return this item because of a couple of factors:<br /><br />1) This COULD be more an issue with my phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus) than the adapter itself, but each time you turn off the car and subsequently the power supply to the adapter, when you start the car back up, the adapter is on and ready to be connected to, but I would have to toggle the bluetooth on my phone off and back on for it to automatically re-connect.  Slightly annoying when you're on a LONG road trip with fewer stops and long stretches of listening in between.  But for just normal daily driving and much shorter listening periods this just made it not worth it.  Again, this could have been my phone but I didn't exactly do a lot of \\\\\"testing\\\\\" to rule out that it was the adaptor either.  I did also have a couple of instances where it would seem to re-connect (you hear a little beep through the car speakers each time it re-connects) but for whatever reason the sound wouldn't play at all....track times would be elapsingbut you wouldn't hear anything through the car speakers or the phone speakers, unless you turned bluetooth badk off.  And even turning bluetooth on the phone back on didn't seem to fix it.  Each time this occurred it would just \\\\\"magically\\\\\" start playing again, wasn't able to determine exactly what I might have done to get it to work correctly.  And again, I didn't spend a ton of time/effort trying to diagnose the actual issue.<br /><br />2) The physical size of the adapter, while not huge by any means, was large enough it took up a bit of space in my console.  Granted, the console in my '07 Infiniti G35 isn't exactly gargantuan like something you might find in an SUV, but I still like to make use of it for other things and not have this adapter taking up nearly all of that space.",

I got bad wrist pain within a week of using this.<br />The bean bags on the bottom are great, but very soon your laps get hot because of them. :(<br />And the surface with the mouse pad does not provide enough breathing room for the laptop fans and my laptop which already gets hot easily, was getting even more hot.<br /><br />for the same price, I can get a laptop cooler.  Yes, I will lose the storage underneath which is awesome by the way, and the large area, but at least my laptop will not slip/slide and it'll run cooler.",

I wuldn't be comfortable having that adapter plugged into my HDD inside my PC for a long time, though. I thought of this as a quick solution to get files out of an old HDD and then disconnect it. For the price, you can't beat that. If you're looking for a longer term connection for your old HDD which you don't want to throw away, I'd suggest a HDD enclosure to use as an external HDD.",

            "input": "I wrote this in other reviews I did of camera bags, I used to be a full-time hobbyist who loved to go out shooting, but my interests and commitment have changed since becoming a parent.  I downsized from a DSLR setup to a Mirrorless and have since had my needs in a camera bag change.  Prior to having kids I would pack the usual camera gear for enthusiasts (filters, tripod, on occassion flashes, OCF supplies, etc).  Now my bag is half camera equipment and half kid gear.  You're as likely to find a sippy cup or extra snacks or diapers in my bag as you would a spare battery or memory card wallet.  If I had no kids, this bag would get 5 stars from me, it just packs a massive amount of gear.<br /><br />As I write this review Im in the middle of a 2 night, 3 day trip on D.C. and just spent the day at the National Zoo.  I had with me the Sony a6000, 16-70 f/4, the 24 f/1.8, and the 70-200 f/4.  All fits in this bag with room to spare.  think tank lists that you can fit the 70-200 f/4 in the bottom left pouch, and you can, but with the hood reversed and the tripod collar off.  I had it setup with the a6000 and the 16-70 attached in the top left, the 24 and the 20 pancake in the top right pouch, and the 70-200 in the bottom left pouch.  The others were left empty.<br /><br />Pros<br />- again, a lot of space for lenses and other gear.  Can fit a laptop and tablet.  Can fit a 70-200 f/4.  I could've had room for 3-4 other lenses, and a lot of other camera equipment.<br />- included rain cover.  Seems trivial, but with my other main bag, the Mindshift Gear Panorama, which is more expensive than this one ($199) and made by the same parent company it's a $20 option.<br />- lots of extra pockets for more storage of small items like caps, filters, card holders, etc.<br />- opens up nicely to allow more gear placed on the bottom without having a flap come over like a lot of other backpacks such as the TT Streetwalker.<br />- zippers are top notch, shoulder straps are nicely padded.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Again for me who has to carry kid stuff, a lot of which may get wet (sippy cups, juice boxes, etc), having no isolated section is a negative.  This is the main reason why Im keeping my rotation 180 as my go to backpack.  I can keep my kids things in the top section, my camera gear in the belt section, and have access to both easily.  Can also ask my wife or someone else with me to just zip open the top and take what they need out without me having to remove the bag.<br /><br />- Having so much room might lead one to overpack.  I'll be honest I got this bag simply because it said it could hold a 70-200 f/4 in the bag.  It can but storing/removing is a lot of work.  Have to remove the tripod collar, reverse the hood, zip the bag wide open, etc.<br /><br />- Being able to store all this gear doesn't help with accessibility.  Still have to take the bag off to remove the camera/change lenses.  At that point you end up carrying the camera on a strap around your shoulder most of the time, then the bag ends up just being a lens storage system and you have this larger bag on your back with a lot of empty space.<br /><br />- Waist belt seems cheap and useless.  It's funny how much different it is on this vs the rotation 180.  Obviously the rotation 180's one needs to be nicely made because it's the main part of that bag, but that one just screams quality vs this one which seems like an afterthought.<br /><br />- Pack is comfortable for the most part.  Maybe it's just me, but any pack, regardless of how it's made will start to wear on you sooner or later.  I love reading reviews of other bags where the reviewer says that they're able to carry it for hours and hours and not feel a thing.  I mean you're carrying 10-20 lbs on your back, how could it not weight you down.  But this bag seems less comfortable than my mindshift bag.  I'm sitting here with sore shoulders and discomfort in my upper back.<br /><br />Again, if you're strictly a shooter and can carry your camera gear and only that and want a bag that can fit a lot of gear for a Mirrorless system, this is the bag for you.  I thought that it would be the ideal bag for me.  And 2 years ago it would be.  But now for present me, the one who has small kids, this isn't it.  I'll be sticking with my rotation 180 bag for the foreseeable future.",

I knew I wanted to get an NAS with mirrored RAID because the thought of having to rip so many CDs again was not pleasant. We are an all-Mac household as well, so we needed something that did not require a PC for initial setup (I'm looking at you, HP Media Vault).    What's good:  -Very fast reads and writes to the ReadyNAS Duo. I now keep my iTunes Music folder on the NAS and the iTunes Library file on my Macbook Pro, and the performance is great.  -Fast network speeds using AFP (the standard network protocol for a Mac).  -Fairly easy to setup the basics using their wizard.  -Lots of advanced options if you need it (password-protected accounts, Internet access).  -Easy printer sharing. Just plug in your USB printer! (And no Mac limitations like the Synology.)  -Recognized my APC-brand UPS; it can monitor the UPS and automatically shut down during a power outage when the battery drains to a certain level (you can set the remaining battery level to your liking).  -Built-in backup software allows you to backup to an external USB drive at the push of a button (though I haven't tested this yet).  -iTunes streaming server works very well; it's very fast over the local network. It shows up in iTunes under the \\\\\"Shared\\\\\" section as \\\\\"Itunes Server.\\\\\"  -Small and quiet.  -Uses less energy than the old iMac.  -Adding a second hard drive (like I did) gives you peace of mind with data redundancy.  -Solid construction.  -Hot-swappable drives on trays (you can also purchase extra trays to rotate drives).  -Easy to expand the storage by swapping in larger hard drives one at a time (though I haven't tested this).  -Great widget for the Mac to monitor the Duo (available capacity, temperature, UPS condition, fan speed).  -Configuration is done through a web browser.    What's bad:  -The UPnP streaming is really poor. Previously I used Connect360 on the old iMac to stream music and movies to an Xbox 360, and the iMac was many, many times faster than the Duo. It can take 20 seconds or so for the Xbox 360 to fully load any one of the music lists (Albums, Artists, etc.). By comparison, if I turn on Connect360 on my Macbook Pro and stream the same 93GB iTunes Library from the Duo, the performance is great! (Then again, the Videos folder on the Duo does not have a lot of subfolders and it loads fairly quickly.) Obviously I'm not an expert on UPnP servers, but if streaming media is your absolute top priority, this might not be the box for you.  -The documentation is really light. You'll need to go to the ReadyNAS forums to get answers at some point. As far as forums go, they are very helpful.  -You will need some knowledge of networking terms. Not hard to learn, but the software was clearly not written by anyone from Apple.  -Expect to spend at least 30 minutes with the initial setup, not including any file copying that needs to be done.  -Too little RAM. I upgraded to 1GB (available through Amazon).  -Small list of approved hardware upgrades, including RAM, UPS and hard drives. There also seems to be a lag in approving new items.  -Not all brands of UPS are supported.  -Approved hard drives are server-grade, not consumer desktop models. Expect to pay about 50% more (but theoretically they should be more reliable). I purchased a second hard drive from Amazon from the approved list (a Western Digital 500GB) for ~$90.  -Not the cheapest NAS out there.    What's needed:  -Better UPnP streaming. I'm not sure if this is a software limitation or a processor limitation.   -More base RAM.    To sum it up: My only real knock against it is the UPnP streaming. As an NAS, it offers reliable and redundant storage combined with fast network speeds; works with different operating systems (and works very well with Macs); and it's very energy efficient. Unless media streaming is at the absolute top of your list, the ReadyNAS Duo offers great performance for the price.     For added research, check out the charts at [...]  There's a great feature to sort by Price vs. Performance. Highly recommended!",

So while I am waiting to get that replaced, this Dell Optiplex 745 will more than suffice for the price I paid.",

            "input": "I had high hopes for this unit. The specs look great, the capacity is huge, and it comes with NovaBackup and access online through a buffalo website and phone app.<br />Now, after ordering, exchanging, and returning 2 of these units, I am wiser and able to, I hope, save another unsuspecting customer from the aggravation and subsequent disillusionment that this product caused me.<br />Specs and software sound good until it arrives, you plug it in, and you install the software. The first thing you notice is the slow firmware interface. For a product that boasts a 1.6Ghz internal processor, a lag of plus or minus 5 seconds is long and feels longer every time you access it. Want to log in to the firmware? That's an extra 10 to 15 seconds. Flipping through the various pages of firmware settings? 5 seconds of wait coming your way. I didn't actually measure it but is a long enough delay that the programmers added a loading animation to make sure you didn't think it a bug. Every page people. After comparing the performance to my netgear router, it came away looking pretty pathetic, and my router isn't packing the kind of hardware found in this NAS.<br />Then there's the update issues. My first unit prompted me to update virtually the instant I plugged it in. That's how it should be you say; At least until you get the error message about the DTCP-IP protocol not being able to update. Yeah, the firmware update is broken into 2 distinct parts. For those not familiar with it, the DTCP-IP protocol is a function connected to DLNA, the standard file sharing software, that allows the unit to work with copyrighted media. Apparently, one of the 'perks' that the company fails to mention in it's marketing material is a bug in the update algorithm for DTCP-IP that prevents it from updating. I thought it might be teething troubles, so I checked the buffalo forums. They had questions and complaints about this particular issue going back to January of this year. When I contacted tech support and asked about it, I was told this was a known issue and that a fix was on it's way. When, I asked? No idea, they said. Lovely.<br />I decided that I would deal with it as DLNA still worked with non-copyright stuff and the unit was still pretty speedy on storage and retrieval.<br />Then I installed the NovaBackup software. There's an upgrade, I was told. Click here! So I clicked. A page on the NovaBackup site came up. Special Deal! Buffalo customers can update free! ($20 handling charge). Excuse me? So now let me get this straight... I can upgrade the pack-in software, trumpeted on all the marketing material as free, with a $260 product, only to find that the free upgrade has a $20 handling charge for the incredibly laborious backend action associated with me clicking on the download button?! The website helpfully stated that those with a license key could click on the download button for really for real free. So I looked for the key on the installed app. What a surprise that the key info panel was blank. So, I emailed Buffalo, expressing my distaste for this rather obvious attempt to bilk me of an extra $20. You're welcome to use the version included with the unit, was the terse reply. Gee, thanks. Anyone out there old enough to remember shareware? I'm here to tell you, it ain't dead; It shacked up with Buffalo, Inc.<br />Then there was the webaccess feature. I have an android phone. They have an android app named WebAccess. Sweet I thought. Access through phone. What could go wrong? Enabled it through the unit firmware. Downloaded app. Started app with big grin on my face. App states it would love to work; all it needs is for me to turn off SSL because the app doesn't support it. Face loses grin. Emailed tech support to inquire just what kind of insane company produces an android app intended to stream an individual's personal data to one of the most insecure technological inventions yet devised by man, a smartphone, that does not allow encryption of said dataBY DESIGN.<br />Fine, I thought, me being of the eternally generous (some would say gullible) disposition. I still have a decent, if slightly hobbled, NAS solution. Until a week later, when the unit started clicking loudly every 5 minutes. Now I'm a semi-pro computer tech and I know that sound. It said 'bad hard drive controller' very loudly whilst running across my desk stark naked with a sign that screamed 'dead duck' in big, ugly letters. So I emailed tech support. They told me to RMA it.<br />Sigh.<br />Unit number 2 arrived a week later. Plugged it in and it said nothing about an update for firmware, despite the very obvious fact that the version was obsolete. Nothing a could do would get this thing to even acknowledge it needed to update.<br />It was a moot point as it happened, since this unit sounded like a box of crickets the instant I turned it on. Cue desk streaker with annoying voice and ugly placard. RMA numero dos. This time I got my money back.<br />Do yourself a favor and get a Synology NAS. The DS112j is pretty sweet...",

This fan stays at 100% speed regardless of whether or not I have anything external connected such as lan, external monitor etc.  I called Lenovo and they tell me that they have no way to control the fan which is not completely true because they do have a program called fan dust extractor that stops and starts the fan to attempt to remove dust.

I came across a great deal which was too tempting and went ahead with the purchase. I thought the specs were very good and it had all the important bits that I was looking for in a laptop. My criteria for a good laptop for my use based on my needs were:<br /><br />Light-weight<br /><br />Comes with a DVD burner (being an audiophile I cannot do without a burner, secondly I am a Linux junkie so I keep testing new distros all the time besides burning them for friends and family)<br /><br />Matte screen (I cannot stand glossy screens as they give me headaches with the glare)<br /><br />Large storage which is speedy<br /><br />Great battery life<br /><br />Well built with metallised case<br /><br />Good keyboard and trackpad<br /><br />The answer was - Samsung Series 5 Ultrabook<br /><br />It is very different from all those IBM Thinkpads I used all these years (I went through 5 of them in last 15 years)<br /><br />I updated most of the software, as well as windows updates. After registering it with Samsung they also gave me 3 extra months of warranty.<br /><br />Out of the box the default settings were all Samsung optimized so it was a balance between power and extended battery life. I put it in high performance mode and this is when this thing was blazingly fast, The trade-off was battery lasting 4 instead of 7 hours, still not bad.<br /><br />What I really liked:<br /><br />Speed<br />Hard drive capacity<br />Screen and graphics<br />Sound better than I expected from the speakers considering it is and ultra thin and light laptop<br />Good wifi connectivity, locks in and does not drop the connection.<br /><br />Fit and finish is excellent for the price but not really built like a tank which was standard for the Thinkpads. (Thinkpads also costs more for the sake of argument)<br />Not much bloat-ware, although I did delete a few programs which I would not use<br /><br />Samsung software updates worked like a charm, it not only updated all the software and patches but also updated the bios without any hassle. The laptop is eligible for free Windows 8 upgrade.<br /><br />Full recovery disk came with the package plus hidden partition of Samsung for factory reset, I tested it and it took only 11 minutes to restore. Back in the 90's a factory restore on my first IBM laptop took 6 hours<br /><br />4 GB ram in single bank and bank 2 empty so upgrading is not wasteful and I can simply drop a 4 GB mem stick in the empty one for a total of 8 GB on-board. A 4 GB stick on Amazon is for $24. I have seen other laptops with 2 GB in each slot or a stick of 4 in fixed and 2 in user replaceable slot which means in order to upgrade your 2 GB stick is rendered useless for which you have paid.<br /><br />Plenty of ports for all kinds of connections including a vga port (I am surprised they managed it on this one, many ultra-books do not sport one).<br /><br />What I did not like:<br /><br />The keyboard: my IBM laptop was too good, no comparison here, the tactile feedback is nowhere near the IBM one. It was generally said about IBM keyboards that they were the best, now I understand why they said so. However the keyboard on this machine is much better than most out there today.<br /><br />Keyboard is not back-lit or illuminated, I sorely miss this. I use my laptop at night in bed and the illumination was very useful.<br /><br />The A/C cord length is not as long as I would have liked.<br /><br />All in all it was a good decision to go for it. I have been playing around with it for good two weeks and I have to say it is giving very good service and I am beginning to like it more and more.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I did not buy it on Amazon but from my workplace as I was eligible for an employee discount.<br /><br />Updated: January 14, 2013<br /><br />It was very important that I update this review after having used the computerfor sometime now.

I contacted Samsung over the phone and after going through the routine with the tech support they finally asked me to send it for repairs. A return label was emailed to me and I sent the laptop off to them. after about two weeks in early January I received it back from Samsung who informed me that the motherboard and the battery were replaced. All this work was covered under the warranty.<br /><br />I was slightly dissapointed in a way that I was left without a laptop for 15 days and in my opinion Samsung should have given me a new one promptly. Nevertheless, I was very satisfied in the sense that they did not touch the hard drive or reformatted it but sent it back in the same condition, intact with all the changes I had done in terms of updating the existing system, installing software of my choice and customizing it.

I confirm that this was the work of the Chinese manufacturers, since only they can leave capacitors half soldered and soldering solution spread all over the board. In plain words, the back of the board was covered in a sticky solution that I had to wash off with alcohol (this is what they were supposed to do). In theory it doesn't cause any serious malfunction, but come on, this is Intel we are talking about!<br />I plugged the board and it was starting on it's own and shutting down whenever it wanted. I later discovered, that the power button was soldered and either it was the soldering solution or the button malfunction. Each time I tried to figure out the cause of the problem, I caught my self on a thought that this is not supposed to be my concern! I payed for a working motherboard and I received cheap Chinese quality!<br />When powering on, the board kept giving me a code 21 error no mater the memory configuration. In other words, the board is completely screwed!<br />Since I do not live in the US, I can't return the product, because it would cost me half the price just to send it back.<br />I really wanted to like this board!

The thing I have a major problem with is the fact that this package of accessories comes with no instructions!  I don't know why I need or how to use a lot of the stuff in here.  And I don't know how to find out.  The light, I think, would work well, but either it was broken on arrival or it needs new batteries (which I assume will cost more than the gadget is worth).  And, what the heck is a headphone splitter?  All in all, this was not a good buy at almost $30.00.  I would have been happy with paying half the price, considering all the useless stuff.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I tried to use the car charger for the first time last night, and it doesn't work at all.  First off, I really had to jiggle it around to get it in the right position to get the power light to come on.  Then, to top it off, it doesn't charge my Kindle.  I think it doesn't connect inside the Kindle.  My cell phone uses the same chargers, so I was stoked to have this for the car, but alas, it's no good.<br /><br />Oh, and I did find out what a headphone splitter is.  My hubby and I used it on a plane ride, and it really comes in handy.  If two people are watching a movie or listening to a Kindle book, you just plug this baby in, and you each have a set of headphones.  Nice.<br /><br />Still not worth the price, though.",

Otherwise, it will bulge and the flap will not stay closed.<br /><br />The clap doesn't snap you see.

I don't usually like to write reviews but this one got me, not for the obvious reasons. The router works great, has many user friendly settings, it\u2019s a dual band and even has the guest network. Let me advise you, and I strong recommend it, use the CD that comes with the router to set it up. It's a breeze. What I wanted to warn you though, beware if you have any computers running Vista, in my case 32Bit. I had a Linksys E1000 that did the job before, I have 3 laptops, 2 iPads, 2 kindles and three iPods, not all running at the same time of course, Plus I have Netgear switch feeding two 3 DVRs, PlayStation, a surround sound, smartv, a DVD player and a roku. I know I have a lot of stuff, but I had to change my router ONLY because my wifi kept dropping. This router is nice looking and does the job so far. However, back to my vista laptop. My son, who is a Minecraft fanatic, loves his laptop so he can play. After I connected the new router, everything worked flawlessly, EXCEPT the laptop that has vista, which is my son's. I could connect to the router no problem, but there was no internet access at all, only unidentifiable network. The ONLY resolution I could find was that the laptop could only connect to WEP encryption, and not the WPA which the N capability works on, not the WEP. So it as a major bummer to accept this because now I had to change this one setting so all my other devices connects to accommodate this one laptop. I did some research and found two articles. My current wireless adapter Atheros 5007 was running a driver version of 7.x.something. I came across this one article that this one guy shared the SAME ISSUE and all he did was update his driver. Let me advise you that you won\u2019t be able to find the updated driver by finding the network device in the device manager and updating the driver. You must download it. The update driver feature will say that the driver is up to date. I found a link, which I hope I can post, that took me to a HP website (my laptop is a HP) to download the driver and it had the hp assistant. Once it downloaded, and I installed it, my network connection restarted and BAMMMMM! My new network driver version is 9.2.0.427. I was able to connect to the wireless network using WPA rather than WEP, shortly after I changed the security type from another computer. Overall, that little hiccup set me back, but I'm sure I'll be more than happy with my new router. Better range, and better transfer speeds. Hope this helps!!<br />Article<br />http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/457095/cant-connect-wi-fi-with-wpa-on-vista/<br /><br />Driver<br />http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-108903-1&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001",

Im not a weak man and Im rather large but the screen took a rediculous amount of effort to get it to react and if you tried using the onscreen keyboard the letter you select is 2 letters away from the one the tablet selected. I even calibrated the screen a few times to see if that was the issue. Even if the screen wasnt flawed it wouldnt have been long with the amount of pressure needed to make it react. So that was frustrating but I figured for the price it would take some getting used to. Then.... The screen started blinking at me??? What was going on? I did only charge it for a few minutes so I figured I would let it sit on the charger over night and try it again in the morning. Worked for about 10 minutes before the screen would start blinking again then went blank completely. I shut it off even did a reset a few times finally after a dozen or so times I gave up and said this has to be returned! Dont purchase this tablet! If you want a tablet save your money! This isnt a case of you get what you pay for, this is a case of poor manufacturing trying to cheap out.  ONE MORE THING! ONLY PURCHASE FROM AMAZON DIRECTLY!!! NEVER THE OTHER SELLERS! Ive had a such horrible luck so far but Amazon direct has always been the best online company Ive ever dealt with! Pay extra to always make sure your item is not being shipped directly from a foreign distributer. I finally had to have my credit card company get my money back because they denied receiving it even though I had a tracking number and they signed for it! Good Luck Shoppers!",

If that is the design, and the case is completely open, then there is no good reason to have the connector on the edge of the board, which makes it more susceptible to breaking off. The power connector could have been mounted further in, so that the USB connector doesn't have to stick out of the side.<br /><br />I have wound the thinnest USB micro-cable I could find around the case stand-offs and will just leave it always connected, so I won't have to worry about the power plug breaking off.",

It was placed there to be the primary router for most of the house, versus the G router from the cable company that is in the basement.

Each device will grab the signal of the G router before it grabs the signal from the Media Bridge.  And some of those devices are set to prioritize this router.

The image quality was excellent and edege-to-edge with no black bars or image distortion. As an added bonus, the HD resolution requires a very sharp .248 dot pitch -- perfect for day to day use with text. The downside of True HD 16:9 is that the viewable height is only 10 and 5/8 (the shortest of any 22' LCD I've looked at) as opposed to a full 11 inches or more for viewing a two-page layout WYSIWYG.    The monitor installs easily and is automatically recognized by XP as a Plug and Play Monitor. The only advantage to installing Viewsonic's driver package (that I could tell) was the addition of a color-calibrated profile -- which didn't seem to make any difference.    Like most modern LCDs, its stand has only a tilt adjust and no height adjustment. I guess the assumption is that with a wide viewing angle, height adjustment is less critical.    I like that the screen has a matte, non-glare finish. I wish I could say the same about the bezel. The high gloss attracts fingerprints and dust like... well you fill in your own colorful analogy.    Button placement, on the lower right, is a poor choice for placing two displays side by side and flush. You can barely read the button labels against the piano black bezel, and the status indicator is far too big and bright. But I like how input source switching (VGA or DVI) can be achieved with a single button press.    The OSD has its share of quirks. Why did Viewsonic think the end user would enjoy being nagged about setting the display to 1920x1080 for optimal performance? Thankfully, this can be disabled. But it should never have been in the software in the first place.    As so many others have noted, the sound quality of the built-in rear-firing 2x2W speakers are truly abysmal -- completely without bass response of any kind and adequate for only the most basic of computer beeps.    The different ECO modes are an interesting concept and might be helpful if you plan on leaving the display on 24/7 without a screen saver -- to monitor a dynamic website for example. The most conservative setting (50% reduction in brightness) seems a bit too dark at first, but I was surprised at how quickly my eyes adapted.     In contrast (pun intended) the dynamic contrast feature worked poorly, often rendering video that was simply too dark. Also, ECO shouldn't be used with dynamic contrast and it would be good user interface design to automatically shut off the one when the other is selected. It would also be more useful if it were easier to access. I need to press nine buttons every time I want to change ECO settings. I'd love to see all 4 buttons replaced with a pushable scroll-wheel like on an HTC Mogul phone.     Rather than dynamic contrast, I would much rather have a dynamic ECO feature -- turning down the brightness during periods of less redrawing activity. Or better yet -- have some ability to sense ambient light levels and adjust brightness accordingly.    Bottom line: This is an excellent display for gaming, watching movies, and everyday use so long as you BYOS (bring your own speakers). Graphics professionals will want to look elsewhere.",

Because of an amazing deal that Amazon ordered I decided to go with the kindle. I was excited. Once I received my device, the hidden disappointments began to roll in. Carousel; is pointless and rather aggravating to use. It becomes an endless list that's annoying to continually delete programs from. My other disappointment is how shallow the app base is for the kindle. Very controlling; almost like Apple but without the massive app resources. I can't use Google chrome, google docs (side note: amazon does have their own versions of cloud storage, but I prefer the seamless browsing that google provides) or any google play apps or even Itunes apps; only amazon apps (mainly consisting of paid apps). The tablet is a beautify made and the screen is crisp and responsive. The real power of the kindle comes from the massive Amazon prime account. So if you're not into that, you're pretty much missing out on the true point of this tablet; a media devouring machine. This thing has potential, but Amazon put's limits of what could be an amazing device. Despite it's beautiful screen, the adds, the limited app store, the need to get an amazon prime account to get real use out of it, the useless Carousel option, the lack of support for google made it a no for me.

One would think that you might want to do a little more with the build than a $399 bargain store machine.  The MAJOR point here is if you wanted to add additional sata ports--like a raid controller card--YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE to do this at this point in time (Have upgraded the bios to Intel,s latest). Have tried LSI, Highpoint, 3Ware (Pcie-x1  and Pcie-x4) all of which worked flawlessly on Boxed Intel Desktop Board Extreme Series ATX Form Factor for Second Generation Intel Core Family Processors BOXDP67BGB3--NONE work on the Intel Desktop Motherboard LGA1155 DDR3 1600 ATX - BOXDH77KC. Even tried a cheap PCI silicon chipset based card--PROBLEMS.  Not sure if its the change from sandy bridge to this newer 3rd generation. One reviewer states that it is a no frills board--that is okay, BUT you should be able to add SOME frills (it has the necessary slots on the motherboard). Also tried an old Promise PCI non raid sata card--NO LUCK--basically the computer, if it \\\\\"sees\\\\\" the card at all will just sit on the Intel logo screen. I did get it to boot without any hard drives attached to the add on cards. Went thru the whole process of booting without hard drives attached (have several WD Caviar Black 1 Terrabyte units that have worked with the above listed raid cards on the BOXDP67BGB3 BUT NOT with the raid cards on the BOXDH77KC--Even got them to work with these raid cards on an older Supermicro core 2 duo board with Pcie slots) AND then attached and created raid--NO BOOT--sits on the Intel logo screen.  I even noticed 1 person on that auction site selling his new BOXDH77KC with the same basic comments concerning the use of add on raid cards (he just wanted to build an inexpensivehome server). Have not tried other Pcie add on cards EXCEPT the SAPPHIRE AMD Radeon HD 6870 1GB GDDR5 PCIE Graphics Card which works flawlessly on this motherboard.  Maybe Intel will address this issue in a further bios update.  It seems that any add on card that may have a \\\\\"bios\\\\\" on it (as raid cards do) have a problem with this motherboard. Again, I did not expect many \\\\\"frills\\\\\", BUT you should be able to ADD some (the motherboard has the slots). That is the reason for the 3 stars.",

I used the pen on a Monday evening for an hour meeting, at the end of the meeting the remaining charge was almost full. I placed the pen in the cradle, went to upload the meeting to the computer and the Livescribe Desktop software told me there was an update to it and a firmware update to the pen. I ran the updates, as I have in the past and continued to upload the meeting to the computer. Had the continuation of the meeting the next morning and when removing the pen from the cradle it had a full charge. There was about 20 minutes of non business chatter prior to the meeting, and after these 20 minutes, the pen was dead. Kaput!  I went to the support site, and there were suggestions on re-flashing the pen. I did. No fix, in the morning removed the pen from the cradle with an indicated full charge. After 20 minutes it'st dead after another full evening of charging (plugged into a computer that does NOT go to sleep).   Here's the real bummer. Livescribe/Pulse offers no battery replacement. They offer no discount or upgrade path over what you can get for yourself online. The end result is you're buying a pen that will be dead sooner or later, and there is no guarantee after the first year. This is an expensive luxury that I may have to abandon.",

            "input": "The screen protector came in an envelope tucked in the bottom of an Amazon box with multiple other items from my order. I immediately noticed that the protector for the top of the tablet was creased.<br /><br />I knew it was going to be a water install, which didn't phase me because I have installed many Zagg products in the past. What I didn't realize was that it didn't come with the solution. My own ability to put a reasonable amount of liquid on the protector and the device was seriously miscalculated. My review might be slightly better if it had come with a spritz bottle (like Zagg ones do) rather than instructions to make my own solution.<br /><br />Anyway, there was so much liquid in my install that it was difficult to squeegee it out fully while keeping the protector in place. I also was unimpressed with the squeegee itself. It was a small piece of cardboard (as opposed to the rubber one Zagg provides) that was fully capable of scratching the protector in the process of squeegeeing!<br /><br />Once I got as many bubbles out as I could and had everything perfectly aligned, I left it alone for a while. When I came back there were new bubbles and lots of 'em! At that point the protector was stuck on enough that they couldn't be worked out without ruining it. I just had to wait longer and hope they disappeared. Which they did, mostly.<br /><br />The next day when I wanted to start using my computer again I was disappointed to find that the screen protector had a sticky texture to it. The areas that are heavily touched, such as scrolling areas, began to feel less tacky fairly quickly. Overall though, the cover has enough tack to make swipes stick a bit. It definitely doesn't feel like glass.<br /><br />After a few days with it on, I noticed that the keyboard for the T100A presses on the protector. If you leave it shut for a while, the screen protector will have a dent/scratch that doesn't go away in a reasonable amount of time. It's right in the middle of the screen and very distracting.<br /><br />I'm pretty disappointed with this product overall. It is easily scratched (as evidenced by multiple scratches caused my the squeegee), it feels tacky and was terribly hard to put on without a solution spray provided. Had it come with a spray, I likely would not have scratched it while squeegeeing as I wouldn't have had so much liquid to remove.<br /><br />Luckily the price was good at least. I would never have bought this if it were selling for full price. $10 with Prime is my limit.",

            "input": "The 3rd Generation Kindle reader is the first eBook reader that I have ever owned.  While it's not perfect, there are many more things that I like about the Kindle than things I dislike.  Consequently, I feel confident in recommending it to most users, and in particular to users, like me, who enjoy discovering new books, have run out of space to store physical books, and have a bright indoor space to read in.      For me, reading on the Kindle was not \\\\\"love at first sight\\\\\".  Unlike a physical book, the Kindle features a large screen, prominently located in the middle of the device.  This would be fine except that the screen's location is precisely where I put my thumbs while reading!  Like most issues with the Kindle, however, this one is easily remedied:  A Kindle cover, such as M-Edge's excellent Go! cover solves this problem nicely, allowing you to hold the Kindle as just you would a physical book, without putting your thumbs on the screen.    The second problem I had with the Kindle was just getting used to reading on it.  I have read hardcover and paperback books all my life, from the time I was 2 years old to today - over 25 years.  The Kindle simply feels different than a paper book.  Besides being much lighter than most books, the Kindle has roughly equal weight distribution, with slightly more weight located in the lower half of the device (where I'd assume the battery is).  The Kindle's 3 built-in fonts (Regular, Condensed, and Sans Serif) are all excellent - when they're properly used by the book publishers.  Reading the Kindle is as easy as reading a paper book, provided you have adequate lighting.  \\\\\"Adequate\\\\\" in my experience, is light that you can comfortably read a paper book by.  As the Kindle is a passive (as opposed to backlit) reading device, you will require a source of light.  Having said that, it reads excellently in direct sunlight based on my experience.    Instead of pages, the Kindle uses \\\\\"locations\\\\\", and this takes some getting used to.  My one-thousand (1,000) page paperback copy of War & Peace has over twenty-six thousand (26,000) locations on the Kindle.  Were it not for the Bookmark function, this would make finding my place in the book rather difficult!  Fortunately, the Kindle lets me easily bookmark, annotate, and highlight passages of interest while I am reading.  These features, combined with the linking feature, make reading even more of a pleasure than with traditional books.  For example, I love history books, and on the Kindle I can click to a numbered footnote link, read the footnote, and simply press the \\\\\"Back\\\\\" key on the Kindle to return to where I am reading.  Before getting the Kindle, I used a combination of sticky notes and my fingers to do this.  With the Kindle, navigating my favorite books is both simpler and easier.    Overall Impression:  While it took some getting used to (I was physically uncomfortable with the Kindle for about 2 weeks until I learned how to hold it comfortably) I am now a Kindle convert.  Because it's so easy to download book samples, I've downloaded about a dozen books that interest me, and purchased a half a dozen more.  Also, I know how to make the Kindle work for me:  Fonts, number of words per line, and line spacing are all easily adjustable.  The built-in dictionary - the New Oxford American Dictionary - is superb, and lets me quickly and easily find definitions to new words without interrupting my reading experience.  And though there is currently no equally good dictionary in French (my second language), I expect that it's only a matter of time before one is made available through the Kindle store.  And that's the beauty of the Kindle:  It's a functional, highly useful eBook reader now, whose capabilities will continue to evolve with time.  In short, it's worth buying now, and will only get better with time.  4/5",

There is no crispness here at all, and some tones don't come across at all. Maybe I'm rating too hard, this is after all a fairly cheap system. Bass was not that clean either and seemed to focus around a very tight frequency range.<br />2) The left and right speakers have specialized connectors, meaning there is no way to extend them, they are tethered to the sub (which is typical, however these are very short and did not allow me enough length to setup my desk the way I wanted)<br />3) Poor construction and quality control... The connector for the left speaker at the sub/amp was very loose. I actually could not tell if it was making a connection and felt it may actually fall out on it's own. In addition, there was very audible static while doing anything with the right speaker (where controls are). If I just touched (not pressing) the power button it made all kinds of noise! The input cable that came with the system had a short as well and I had to replace it right away or every time it was touched there would be very loud sounds!<br />4) Very susceptible to interference. If the cable going to the right speaker is anywhere near a power source you will hear lots of background noise!<br /><br />What I did like:<br />1) It powered on and played sound... Plenty of power, volume, and bass.<br />2) No, that's actually all I liked about this system.<br /><br />I agree with a few of the other reviewers, those who are saying this system sounds wonderful are either deaf or have not had a chance to compare directly with anything better!<br /><br />BUYER BE AWARE --- If you order this from AMAZON.COM it is NOT RETURNABLE!

They informed me that I could again return the item for a refund but by this time I was left with no choice but to keep it as my old battery was dead.<br />About a week later I get an email from Bavvo Electronics saying they are sorry and asked if I would like to return the product or receive a refund of 20% in lieu of removing the 1 star rating I gave them.  I replied back asking if they would please send me a true 51Wh batter as advertised rather than offer me a partial refund.  I also informed them that they had done this on two occasions so it was hard to believe this was just a mistake where the wrong item was shipped.<br />After about 4 battery cycles the design capacity of the battery went from 4100mAh down to 3800mAh.  Another 3 cycles of the battery and now the maximum capacity reads 3453mAh and a design capacity of 3800mAh.

But there are also much better flash drives available now.  The SuperTalent Express 3.0 is currently the only 3.0 flash drive available other then the SuperCrypt also by SuperTalent. The SuperCrypt is supposed to be even faster then the Express and comes with built in encryption software. However the SuperCrypt is even bigger and bulkier and nearly twice as expensive. Since I don't need encryption software, I got the Express version. I sprung for the SuperTalent Express 3.0 even though I don't currently have a motherboard that supports usb 3.0. It is backwards compatible and works just fine plugged into a usb 2.0 port. It is supposed to be faster reading and writing then any 2.0 flash drive even when used at 2.0 speeds.   I have only been able to use the drive at 2.0 speeds and it is still far faster then any other drive I have owned. A folder full of almost 4,000 word documents took less then a minute to copy to the Express drive. A folder full of almost 400 songs also took less then a minute to copy. Individual video files copied in 1-3 seconds. It is indeed a speedy drive. A blue light flashes on the end of the drive when it is in use. A turbo program comes installed on the drive which is supposed to make using the drive faster. You don't have to turn it on, but why wouldn't you?     The express drive is made of black metal and feels solidly built, however it is not without its faults. The drive casing is a bit bulky, not as much as the SuperCrypt, but enough that I had to unplug the usb port next to it in order to allow it to fit. Depending how your usb ports are spaced you may have to unplug one or even two slots to use this flash drive.  Worse, the metal casing on the drive drive gets very hot when the drive is in use. I mean almost burn your fingers hot. Heat and electronics do not mix well.This makes me question the long term durability of the drive. I was thinking about leaving this drive plugged into my TV usb port to access pics, vids and music. The heat issue nixed that idea, I wouldn't recommend leaving this plugged into any device when not needed. A firmware update was supposed to fix that issue, but I have not been able to test it yet.  Also the design of the drive is nothing to get excited about. The cap pops off and is easy to lose. There are no innovative design features to keep the cap attached, or the end protected that you can find on a number of cheaper drives. The drive has no rubber coating and/or special shock or waterproof protections. It also comes in cheap packaging, the kind you would find if you bought a cheap flash drive off the rack at a Best Buy.  If you search online you can find discount codes to get the Express 3.0 drives at bargain prices. The 16GB version can be had for less then $50 and the 32GB version for less then $85.    Still Depending on your needs there are a number of 2.0 drives available that may better suit you. The fastest 2.0 drive is the Corsair Voyager GTR. The 32GB version of the Voyager GTR can be had for about the same price as the 32GB version of the Express 3.0. The Voyager drives also comes with a durable rubber coating and some water and shockproof capabilities the Express lacks.  Other very fast 2.0 drives include the OCZ Rally 2, the Corsair Voyager GT, the Patriot Xporter XT, and the A-DATA Xupreme. There are some other fast drives as well.    In addition you may need to consider whether you need a flash drive at all. External hard drives have gotten so cheap they are not much more then a good flash drive. The are light and portable, though you will need a usb cord as well, and obviously they do not fit in your pocket like a flash drive. However you can get the Western digital My Book 3.0 1TB version for around $120. That's an entire TB of space at 3.0 USB speed. If you do not have a motherboardsupporting usb 3.0 the My Book works just fine with a 2.0 connection. But it also comes with a PCI card you can install in your computer to use the drive at 3.0 speed. Considering the amount of space your are getting for your money, its a much better buy then a flash drive if you don't really don't need the pocket portability.",

One big limitation is it does not let you manage your apps (add, delete, move screens, etc).<br />- Pairs nicely with other samsung products - Blue Ray player, TV - but works mostly as a remote.<br /><br />Cons<br />- You can spend money and buy an SD-Card but you can't really use it with this tablet. There is no way to move apps from internal memory to SD-Card, download videos directly on your tab to the external SD-Card. What's the point of the Lobotomized SD-Card then? Nice design decision, Samsung. Kudos to the product manager.<br /><br />Recommendations to Samsung<br />- Allow the external SD-Card to be used as an extension of internal storage.<br />- Allow watching whatever is on your screen on the tablet on TV or Blue Ray player. Extend the interaction between the products. Will be great if that's done as an app/firmware update on Samsung devices - wishful thinking?",

When I called a second time, I was told that since the warranty had expired, they could no longer replace my kindle, but they did offer me a discount on a new one. Wow! Thanks Amazon! I'm so glad I decided to take you up on this offer! The technology on this model is light years ahead of my other one, and there are only a little over 3 years difference in the model. I'm fairly computer/technology literate, so I had no trouble registering this one.There have been a few &#34;growing pains&#34; as I've tried to use it.

I have owned this MacBook for a year this week.<br /><br />My primary Mac presently is a 3 year old+ iMac that I am still very satisfied with. I bought this white MacBook so I could write and surf the internet in a variety of places around the house. I purposely did not install or download much software, believing the less stuff clogging this little notebook, the faster and better it would run.<br /><br />The little color wheel that spins but quickly disappears on my iMac will spin for a full minute or more on this MacBook under the same circumstances, maddeningly. It is much slower to load internet pages than my 2002 PowerBook or my iMac, interesting due to the iMac being absolutely crammed with powerful software, such as Adobe CS5 Suite, and dozens more not installed on the MacBook. This MacBook is the slowest computer for surfing the internet I have owned since before I dumped AOL in 1996.<br /><br />The greatest INSULT, however, is the CORD, which despite the Macbook remaining mostly stationary on my work station, has failed me twice, at a replacement cost of $160+.<br /><br />Many people have complained about these flimsy, fragile cords, leading me to believe that Apple would quickly improve them. They absolutely have not, and I interpret any company's lack of attention to an egregious flaw in its product as insulting to its customers. I wouldn't be surprised if the dorks at the Genius Bar referred to the rest of us as Muppets.<br /><br />I absolutely would not recommend the MacBook. The MacBook Pro Models use the same style cord, so if you buy any MacBook, be prepared to have its portabilty grossly compromised by the fact the cord has to be babied so much. As it stands, my happiness at thinking I'd be taking this everywhere I went has been thwarted, since I don't feel at ease even moving it around the house.<br /><br />Update: Three power cords, all genuine Apple products, have failed now. Go to the Amazon reviews for thereplacement cord and feel the rage of the masses. The fact Apple thinks we should spend $100 annual FEE to replace these defective producst is the height of hubris. The cords' flaws make this computer useless, so I am lowering my rating to one star because Amazon doesn't allow ZERO stars. No power cord = no computer.",

This Sony Vaio CR420 laptop combines a new Intel T8100 processor with attractive style multiplexed with all the accoutrements of a modern laptop and maybe more considering it has the not yet agreed upon N-wireless 802.11.  Aside from enumerating all the other features, you go ahead and read for yourself the fairly detailed Amazon description.    Although it does not contain a separate graphics card it's nvidia graphics chip does provide enough power to turn on all the Vista Aero features I know.    My major gripe with this pretty laptop is that when  I compare it to the HP dv2810US it doesn't deliver me anything more (of what I need).  Note that the HP Pavilion's CPU is AMD TL-60.  While I have heard AMD is getting their butt kicked with T8100 (Penryn) I just don't see it here.    Without going to great detail I considered drive size/speed, memory, weight, screen size (Sony is a noticeably brighter screen btw),Bluetooth (pretty sure both stereo -a2dp),battery life, optical drive, speakers, touchpad, and overall quality of build.  The HP performs well in all aspects.  Note,  I say \\\\\"performs\\\\\" instead of compare to differentiate my real world experience versus marketing specs.  I do think the Sony is prettier. Note: I got the blue case b/c it uses a silver keyboard I preferred, most if not all these Vaio's have black keys.  The Pavilion has black keys also.    Overall,  I think a case could be made for choosing the Sony over the much cheaper Pavilion, however, for my station in life and value of a dollar, I chose the Pavilion dv2810us.    Things (of note) I did while I possessed both aforementioned laptops...  connected both wirelessly and wired to my home network (and ultimately Comcast broadband), signed in wirelesly at coffee house to web surf, downloaded and installed updates to Vista, streamed audio/video from Windows Media Server, installed VMWare Server GSX and then multiple OS's within -very slow to start on both laptops(slower than my previous Lifebook S Pentium M 1.6Gz w/ 2MB RAM running XP home).    I contacted both vendor's customer service departments about \\\\\"downgrading\\\\\" to XP Pro from the Vista Premium and it turns out to be not so easy.  In the case of HP, while they highly recommend against downgrading the Web Chat HP guy said he could point me to some of the drivers on the web... but could not say if all the XP - flavored drivers were available.  I didn't get into a discussion with Sony as much but got the same indication.    Hope this helps someone.    PS I like the Sony battery adapter more, it plugs into the laptop from the back with an \\\\\"L\\\\\" shape, the HP plugs from the side and sticks out approx 2\\\\\".  Also the Vaio has what  I consider and annoying light emanating from under the touchpad -I dislike stray light-sources like that and not sure if it has a reason for it.",

As other reviews have mentioned it feels much like a laptop keyboard. However I was never able to type on it as fast as I do either on laptop  or on normal PC keyboard. The reason seems to be combination of short travel and very light resistance for keys. Keys just don't resist your touch enough, and don't bounce back under your fingers. It could be a great keyboard, but at the moment it seems to me mis-calibrated a bit.     Another slight downside is absence of any kind of indicator keys for caps lock, number lock and such.

I've bought at least 10 laptops over the years and this is BY FAR the worst ergonomics I've ever seen on a laptop.     The mouse pad is VERY poorly designed - the sensitive area is completely smooth and has no edges that you can feel so it's very easy to lose the the position of the mouse pad;  your fingers need something you can feel to know they are positioned correctly.   The mouse pad button is incredibly STIFF and again, completely smooth so you have no idea where it is by touch or where the left and right mouse buttons are.   If I use these buttons for more than a few minutes my thumb starts to  hurt because you have to push VERY HARD to get the button to activate.     Anything that requires press-hold is very difficult to do and is sure to cause a thumb RSI injury if you used it all day.    The keyboard button feel is actually pretty good, except HP has inexplicably added an extra row of buttons along the left edge of the keyboard.   This shifts the place you need to place your fingers about an inch to the right.   However, they kept the ESC key in the top left, so that means it's in the wrong place for a touch typist.   The control key, normally in the bottom left of a keyboard is in the wrong place.       They also put the hard drive light in the wrong place.  It's on the LEFT side of the chassis so the only way you can see it is to lean your head two feet to the left.   I've never seen a laptop before that you couldn't see the hard drive light from your normal head position.    Seems like whoever designed this laptop has never used a laptop before, and certainly they didn't actually test this design with human beings.   Unbelievable HP could come up with such an awful  ergonomics after making laptops for so long.        Battery life is nothing special - you might get 2.5 hours out of it.   I recently received an Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 Android tablet - the battery lasts at least 10 hours - and the device weighs 1.2 lbs - 1/4th the weight of this laptop.   Microsoft/Intel/AMD better get their act together because 2.5 hours just doesn't cut it anymore when there's tablet devices that can last 10 hours.",

So far I have been unable to sync Gmail Contacts or Calendars.  There is a Contact App, but no apparent way of syncing Contacts.  There's not even a Calendar App.  Yes, you can always view contacts and calendars through the Web Browser, but there is no integration between that and the Email app on the Kindle Fire.  You should also be aware that there is no apparent support for Exchange Active Sync.  An Exchange Account should work if you have POP or IMAP access, but not traditional Exchange connectivity.  I believe I had reasonable exceptions (it is a $200 device), but shame on me for not doing more research.  My Droid phone has the Kindle app, what I got here was a larger screen with less functionality.  What it does, it does well, but skipping contacts and calendars this is an oversight that keeps it from being a fully functional tablet.  I like being reminded of an appointment when I'm reading on my phone, but that won't happen on the Kindle Fire.  If you want to read books and watch movies, this is a great device.  One other minor flaw is the location of the power button.  So far I have inadvertently shut down the device 4 times while reading (I just got it today).  I tend to hold it against me while I read.  If I hold it right-side up it presses against the power button (and shuts off).  So I have to hold it upside down (which covers the speakers).  Not ideal.

I have the 8.9&#34; fire HD  2012 model I believe. Also, my 2 older daughters have the 7&#34; 2012 model, so I can kind of go off of my experience with those when judging this new one.The screen quality is really nice on this new model. And I really like that they moved the power button away from the volume button because that was a big inconvenience. It's quite small, but sufficient for a child or for someone who likes to carry it with them often. But there are a few things I noticed that I don't like so much... The main thing is that, for whatever reason, there are apps and games that my daughter was using regularly on my kindle that she cannot use on this one. And some of these were not free! When I check the cloud on all of our other devices, those apps show up, but they will not show up on the new kindle! They don't even show up when I search for them in the app store. So I bought this device for her so she won't have to use mine all the time, but she's still going to use it because there are things that she likes to play and apps that I have paid for that she can't access on her kindle. VERY annoying! I hope this is something that Amazon fixes very soon. It also seems like the volume doesn't go up very high at all. I guess I will have to asses more with further use. I also noticed that for a brand new device, it can be pretty laggy, it gets very hot, and the battery seems to drain a lot faster than the other kindles we own.

However it didn't fit snugly around my tablet once I put the case on it (which was within the 8.25 dimensions that the product is advertised to fit). I attached the tab mount to an articulating arm via the screw thread in the back then mounted it on my 6D's hot shoe. The main issue I'm facing is that every time I pan or tilt my camera on my tripod I have to worry about my tablet accidentally falling off. This is extremely frustrating. The rubber used to grip the tablet works if there is no panning. On the contrary, it works well with my Note 3. It's more of a smart phone mount than a tab mount.",

Just consistent bits and pieces the size of grains of rice day after day, month after month.<br /><br />I love this case, but I have to give all of you the strong recommendation NOT to buy this product....  If it did not have the rubber problem I would give this five stars.<br /><br />FYI, I have submitted a request for return to STMbags.com and haven't heard anything back yet.

            "input": "I have always been an avid fan of good pens, both fountain and rollerball or gel pens.  Recently, I have been moving to an iPad as my computer and wanted to begin the transition to a stylus for note taking and navigation, since I won't be handling a mouse much longer.<br /><br />I searched around for a Mont Blanc stylus thinking by now, a pen manufacturer like Mont Blanc would have already created a stylus for using with an iPad, but alas, I couldn't find one, and when I did google Mont Blanc stylus, the Hard Candy stylus came up as about the only top line type stylus that still looked like a fountain pen or at least a very nice gel or rollerball pen.<br /><br />I took awhile to commit to the Hard Candy, but I liked its look and read enough positive reviews that I thought I would like it a lot.  Ordered through Amazon Prime, I got the stylus in fast order and was excited to put it to work with my iPad Air.  Now let me say right off that the Hard Candy stylus has the best tip that I have used, though I have not bought many.  I have a Bamboo that came highly recommended, and I like its grip better than the Hard Candy, though it is slim and the stylus tip is not as sensitive to the iPad screen.<br /><br />The Hard Candy stylus is very sensitive and gives me much better control.  I also like the pen end of the Hard Candy.  I write in blue ink and so when I got the Hard Candy stylus, I immediately exchanged the black ink for a Parker Jotter Gel refill.  The shape of the refill fits perfectly into the Hard Candy barrel without any problems at all.  With the hefty weight and fullness of the barrel, it feels just like a well made pen when I write with it.  So with the sensitivity of the stylus and the versatility of the pen when refilling the ink, the Hand Candy worked perfectly.  That's the good news.<br /><br />I gave the Hard Candy stylus only 3 stars because I was dismayed by the caps on either end of the tool.  Neither end has a place to go when you take them off.  They are not like a fountain pen where you can attach the top to the butt of the barrel while writing.  This is a small but significant concern to me, one I have an issue with, but also something I could live with, if that was the only issue.  Also, I know many have reviewed this flaw, so I wanted to bring it to the attention of Hard Candy.  But...<br /><br />My main issue is with the barrel itself.  I love the brushed chrome and the contour of the barrel on both ends; however, I am not comfortable at all with the sharp ridge that is exposed when you take either cap off the stylus.  When using the stylus, my fingers lay uncomfortably over the sharp edge where the cap usually sits, and I find myself thinking about where my fingers are positioned rather than concentrating on my work.<br /><br />When I am using the pen end of the stylus tool, my fingers again worry about the sharp ridge along the barrel where the cap rests.  I do not like to hold my pen close to the tip.  I enjoy a pen that I can &#34;lean back on&#34; along the barrel.  I am a professional writer that switches back and forth from hard copy to computer, and a pen and its comfort is very important to me.  So when I tried to use the Hard Candy stylus and pen, I loved what I was potentially holding, but it seemed too flawed for me to want to use it as it is now designed. So here is what I did.<br /><br />I redesigned the Hard Candy stylus, and made it work for me.  I took two non-slip rubber finger grips off cheap G-2 Pilot disposable gel pens and slid them onto either end of the Hard Candy barrel, so I would have a firm grip.  The rubber sleeves fit perfectly against the sharp edge of the cap base, so I no longer have to worry about the sharp ridge that was so uncomfortable on either end of the barrel.  All that has made for a perfect tool to use with my iPad Air and any writing that I do on paper.<br /><br />Of course, my alterations have made the caps for either end useless.  They no longer fit the barrel.  So I began looking around at what was in my house and really couldn't find anything that matched or came close to keeping the aesthetics of the pen intact.  What I ended up using (forgive me Pelican Pens) is the top off of one of my Pelican fountain pens with silver accents to cover the gel pen end of the tool.  For the stylus, I am using a pencil eraser that fits very comfortably over the stylus.  It's goofy looking and I want to find something to replace the eraser soon.  Mostly I leave off the eraser, but when I travel or carry the stylus with me, I cover the rubber tip so it won't get damaged.<br /><br />So I am giving the Hard Candy stylus only 3 stars because I had to basically redesign the ergonomics of the pen to fit my need and to remove what I think are terrible flaws in this tool.  It could be the top of its class with more thought being put into the ergonomic elements of style and design.  I am not yet finished with my design yet.  I am still looking for good caps to replace the silver bullet covers.  I don't want to use my Pelican cap for very long simply because it comes off a very expensive fountain pen, but I want this Hard Candy stylus to work out.  I really love the design, the weight and girth of the pen.  It feels great in my hand (with the alterations) and I feel I am writing and touch screening with a top quality tool.  Perhaps the designers this tool need more input from those who use quality pens and are looking for the same in a stylus.<br /><br />So here's the down and dirty.  I love the idea of this stylus.  I love it now that I have corrected the flaws.  Would I buy another?  Well, if I can find good looking caps that match the design, then yes, I would buy another and refit it just like I did the first.  But I am also looking to Mont Blanc, Waterman, and Acme pens to see if and when one of these fine writing instrument companies will take the plunge and make a stylus with the flair and style of a fountain pen.  Maybe it's already outthere, I don't know.  If anyone does know, please respond here, so I can look it up.<br /><br />If Hard Candy gets this design right, I'll stick with them.  I keep allegiances when I like a product, but I won't stay with it if I find a tool that is just as precise in the stylus but with more comfort and ergonomic design.  I have taken too much time to make this particular product work for me.  Fix it, please, so I can write another review of a great redesigned stylus.<br /><br />Thanks for sticking with me on this.  I take my writing instruments very seriously, and for me, this is a writing instrument.",

The software gives you four options for accepting digital or analog signals and I scanned for all of them and I did not get even one channel show up by which to view.

I have no idea if this is true, but am not chancing it for now.  It is light weight and should travel well.  It is about what I expected.  Update:  It is actually less than I expected.  I have, without adding any additional apps or software, begun to get notice that my memory is critically low.  The usable memory on this computer makes it of little value for anything except surfing the web.  Although I didn't expect much more, I did expect to be able to put a few basic apps on it and use them.  I have a 128 gb card to store all of my documents, photos, etc.  No data or documents are stored on the device.  It is simply too limited.  In addition, the track pad has begun to right click everywhere I hit it, except for the far left hand corner.  Very annoying.  I will be replacing it with another lower end laptop",

It would probably be fine for regular use but it feels like it might pop out with any significant drop, but I'm not about to test it. :o)<br /><br />Third, I thought that when using the tab as a reader, the elastic strap could be used to secure the cover.

So I bought another pair and after a year, the plug in the left ear that charges the headset would not function or charge the set. I received another set for Christmas, and yet again, the plastic has broken on the headset, this time it's the plastic around the ears pieces that swivels.

Compared to my office Mac Book Pro and my wife's Sony laptop -- which both provide a nice slightly rough tactile response -- I just couldn't stand to use the slick soft plastic of the 311.    2. The cursor jumps all over the place when typing. I'm not sure if it because the trackpad is so sensitive or something else, but this is very annoying. I couldn't find a simple way to turn off the trackpad (a function key would have been nice).    3. The Atom processor is dog slow in this model. I had used an MSI Wind U100 netbook last year which seemed a bit faster (much more so when overclocked). Loading the browser on this Mini takes forever. It just goes to show that I needed a faster computer.    There are several small notebooks hitting the market now, much faster than netbooks but within two hundred dollars of this one. I'll be doing some more research to find one that is right for me. If you can live with the above caveats, then this might be a nice light travel solution. If not, keep looking.",

I have to say I had high hopes since most people rave about these fans being really quiet. As a silent PC fanatic I can say that these fans are far from quiet at full speed. I turned the fans down a bit and they became acceptable at best. The fan also produces more noise when mounted horizontally vs vertically. It seems they also vibrate a bit and could benefit from rubber mounting pins or gaskets. They do push a good amount of air though and for those looking for strong performance these would probably be better than some of the other choices out there.<br /><br />If I didn't have to mount these horizontally I would probably have gone with Scythe's Slipstream fans. Although they have sleeve bearings they are incredibly quiet. I'll be trying the Kama Flow fans next since these GTs have to go.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've since replaced my Typhoons with Kama Flow SP1225FDB12M. They are much quieter but of course don't move as much air. I moved the Typhoons to my NAS in the living room thinking I wouldn't hear them in the living room but they make enough noise that I can always hear them. Ended up ordering even more Kama Flows so I could replace the Typhoons.<br /><br />I would've loved the Typhoons some time ago when I was all about performance but these days I look for low noise from my components and the Kama Flow SP1225FDB12M wins because this. If you don't mind a little noise the Typhoons do move a good amount of air without sounding like jet turbines but I don't think they deserve the silent or even quiet description that they so often get.",

As everyone else I wanted to eliminate the monthly rental fee I pay ($8 per month).  I am with Comcast.  I installed it and it did successfully install via the online enrollment.  Initially I got great speed - ~28 mbps.  However, I couldn't get speeds over 1 mbps after the first minute...literally.  I called Comcast and they said it never completed enrollment properly and set it up for me.  To be fair, they were cordial and stayed with me until I was connected.  I hung up happy but guess what?  One minute later I was back to 1 mbps.  UGH!!!!  I called back and they were not able to diagnose.  They could see the modem but had no option for resolving the slow connection.  The next day I decided to try again before I giving up.  I connected again and this time I had fair connection speeds.  It wasn't overly consistent compared to my rented modem (~25-27 mbps) but I was getting anywhere from 14 to 28.<br /><br />Next step, connecting to my router (was hard wired to computer to this point).  Here is where I threw in the towel.  I just couldn't get it to connect to my Cisco E3200.  The rented modem (Arris WBM760) had no problems.  I tried every combination of power off the cable modem, power on, power off router, power on and so on and so on.  At this point I felt this was just too much trouble and was concerned about long term reliability even if I eventually could get it to work with my router.  I returned it.<br /><br />I was hopeful for this product but for me it just didn't work out.  I have since purchased the SB6121 and without the need for Comcast intervention I am connected and it's working well with my router.  I have found my connection speed is on par if not a bit faster than the rented one.<br /><br />Relative to inconsistent connection speeds I can't say for sure if the issue is the SB6141 or Comcast.  2 star rating though is because it shouldn't have had trouble playing well with my router.  I've had a dsl router and now two cable modems working fine.  Maybe I just got a defective one?",

Macbook owners would be pleased. In fact, a friend of mine even thought I bought a new laptop/netbook when she initially saw me using it.  Now here comes the BUT...    Typing on it sucks, especially when you use it for as much typing as I do. Let me list the ways: 1. The spacebar doesn't space when you need it to. I tend to (almost always) press the far right side of the spacebar with my right thumb when typing with both hands. Well, it only spaces when you press so hard that you're practically banging on it, and even then it may not work. This holds true for the left side as well. It spaces fine when you press close to the center, however. 2. The lock key is placed right above the delete key; it gets quite annoying when you reach for that delete key with your pinky, but it lands on the lock key instead and turns your iPad off. 3. Same thing with the right shift key, which is placed immediately to the right of the up arrow key. My pinky ends up landing on that up arrow key and words start appearing where it shouldn't. Then, you go to delete, but end up turning off your iPad instead.  Furthermore, the hinge that connects the case and the keyboard doubles as a groove in which to place your iPad. Well, the groove was so tight, I couldn't get my iPad in. My boyfriend tried and same thing; it just didn't fit. I definitely got a dud. Wanting my iPad to magically fit into this beautiful keyboard case, I asked him if he could possibly loosen up the groove for me, which of course he couldn't. So back to the store it will go! But then.. he tried one last time before I wrapped it back up. And somehow.. he got it in!  Too bad the keys suck.  I hope my review is helpful to you. Thanks for reading.  By the way, I do not have these typing issues with my detached Logitech Keys-To-Go keyboard, which I love (link providedbelow). The only problem with that keyboard was I tended not to use it since it wasn't attached.

            "input": "I would like to preface my negative review by saying that I'm a die-hard apple freak and apple stockholder, so I'm not some random PC shill here to bash without reason... That being said, I could summarize my experience with AppleTV by saying: The interface is stunning, and it will impress the masses, but it has a number of fatal flaws that will make a Mac Mini or laptop a better (and more costly) option for the high-end, professional type discriminating user like myself. So this review is here for nitpicking, high end users with high expectations. The rest of you probably won't care...    Let me get what I like out of the way first: The interface is way nicer looking than Front Row. Totally slick. It is a killer way to browse the music library of a remote computer, for instance the one 30 feet away in your office that has an external 500 GB drive full of music and video.     What I don't like...    1. The treatment of images (photos) is totally \\\\\"tuned for the test drive\\\\\" as they say in the auto business. This machine excels at making very low-res images, such as album art, look amazing. HOWEVER, load it up with hi-resolution photos from your own slideshow, and they will come out totally softened. This thing obviously does not have the guts to handle hi-res. It's a little known but true fact that there is a threshold (possibly multiple thresholds) within iPhoto that scale the animation textures of Ken Burns effect photos to different qualities depending on the amount of VRAM and quality of graphic chip in the given mac. This is automatic, and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm postulating that the AppleTV has a very weak graphics processor relative to any other recent Mac, and that would be why the pics are so freaking soft. I bought this thing expressly for slideshows, so it's getting returned to the store tomorrow for this reason alone. Considering that the Apple website currently says \\\\\"your photos will appear in high definition,\\\\\" this one is a big letdown.I guess by high definition they mean 720p.     2. The wireless sync is very slow. It seems to be running at about 8 Megabits, or often less, on a 802.11g network with a full signal strength... not remotely approaching network capacity.     3. The USB port can't be used for external storage. That is a no brainer that Apple blocked out for obvious profiteering reasons. The salesman at Fry's told me that you could use external storage, which illustrates the quality of employee training at Fry's. It was obvious at the time that he was just telling me what I wanted to here, so I risked it. 50/50, right?     4. Slideshow settings are global to all slideshows rather than to individual folders of images. In short, not as configurable as iPhoto.     5. It does not do 1080p. I just bought a 1080p set, so I'm very disappointed. I get 1080p out of my Powerbook when it connects to external Apple Cinema Displays, so I'm confident that once I get the right cable, I will have 1080p coming out of my Powerbook to this new HDTV... no thanks to AppleTV.     Conclusion: If you care about image quality, configurabilty, and the right to plug something useful into the USB port, you need a real Mac and not this AppleTV thing. I have not yet tested the Mac Mini to see if it has superior photo slideshow (Ken Burns animation textures) resolution), but that is my next project... Otherwise, PowerBook will be spending a lot of time docked at my new TV set.",

The buttons that are covered work fine, and feel almost the same as without a cover.  I am able to insert the standard Apple Lightning cable that came with the iPad Mini with no problem.<br /><br />It also offers good protection, covering everything that doesn't need to be a hole.<br /><br />It has a pleasant surface texture to hold on to, not sticky/grippy like some soft polyurethane covers.  The surface is hard enough that it won't scratch easily and dust and hair doesn't stick to it.  It does not collect fingerprints.<br /><br />THE PROBLEM:  When the case is installed there is a continuous ridge that extends in front of the bezel of the iPad Mini, all the way around.  This is part of the protection and is welcome for that purpose.  However, it prevents the Apple Smart Cover from laying flat against the glass and interferes with the magnetic closure of the Smart Cover, which is just barely strong enough to keep itself closed on a naked iPad Mini.  With the iBlason back cover installed the Smart Cover does not have enough magnetic force to stay closed and won't even lay flat. If I put my iPad Mini in a bag, any movement causes the magnetic sleep switch to trigger repeatedly.  This is a deal killer and disappointing.",

It was pretty good - LOTS of compartments, which I make full use of, well-designed, strong and useful carrying handle, and very comfortable even when loaded chock-full of stuff thanks to the shoulder and waist straps distributing weight well. The only minor complaint was that the bungee closure on the front flap quickly gave way, but then I was putting far too much stuff in there anyway.<br /><br />After three years of heavy use (and abuse), the zips on the middle compartment started to show some strain. One side of the zip started to tear out of the fabric a little. But the other side still functioned, and the bag held on despite still very heavy use for another couple of years. Finally, the other side of the zip gave way as well, rendering the bag unusable after five years.<br /><br />So overall, not perfect, but pretty good.<br /><br />HOWEVER - I ordered a replacement when the previous one died. Exact same product name and model number. Product came, looked as good as before, but with one crucial change - NO WAIST STRAP. (On re-reading some other reviews, a few of them did warn against this - well, it's true. There's no more waist strap. There are, however, still the zippered side compartments.) Considering how much heavy stuff I can and do put into the backpack and how long I carry it around for, I find the waist strap crucial and the removal of it inexplicable. Plus, doing that without changing the model number (not even adding an 'A' or '-2' or something to the end) to be sheer incompetence.<br /><br />Sadly, then, going to return this and get another one.<br /><br />That said, if you don't use waist straps / don't put as much weight in your backpacks as I do, then it's still a pretty good product.",

The Hawking HNAS1 Networked Attached Storage Center seemed to be a good solution for this.  I had an extra 3.5\\\\\" disk drive in a drawer, so I bought this unit, inserted the disk drive, set it to Master, attached cables, screwed in 4 screws, and put the case back together.  Voila!  Network Attached Storage.    Configuring this unit was not as much fun.  It does not use DHCP to find a good IP address, and its default 192.168.1.1 is the same as the default Linksys router address.  If you simply plug this unit into a Linksys or other router which is already configured with this IP address, then the Hawking and the router fight it out over who responds to this address.  After several rebootings I got the Hawking unit to win this race, I logged into the web interface from a PC and quickly changed the IP address to one that isn't used by any other device.  Operation became more predictable after this.    The firmware version shipped in my unit (1.01) has a bug in setting the time zone via the web interface.  There is a firmware download (version 1.02) at [...] which will correct this.  Download the file (about 3MB), then use the Hawking web browser interface to upload the firmware into the Hawking device.  It takes several minutes to upgrade.  Unfortunately, I found that the login password was changed after the upgrade and I had to hold the Reset button on the back of the unit for over 5 seconds to reset all accounts and passwords on the unit back to their defaults.  Unfortunately, this also reset the IP address back to the same value as the Linksys router.  Sigh.  Rebooting the Linksys router helped me to somehow log into the unit to change the IP address to a safe value outside the DHCP range again.  Phew!  Using the 1.02 firmware release the time settings appear to stick, though you have to check \\\\\"Use Time Server\\\\\" and supply a good server address - I'd replace the default (a server in Germany) with \\\\\"pool.ntp.org\\\\\".    You need to format your disk via the web browser interface (it uses EXT3 format for the Linux operating system inside the box).  You also need to create one or more shares, and you may want to change the user accounts and passwords.  If you give the \\\\\"guest\\\\\" account a blank password and supervisor priveleges, then you can connect to the share from \\\\\"My Network Places\\\\\" by just double clicking on it.  If you want to use accounts and passwords, then users will need to map the share to a Windows drive letter and supply the appropriate login credentials.    Now that the HNAS1 is up and running I'm happier.  My biggest complaint, aside from the lack of DHCP and need to upgrade the firmware, is that the fan is annoyingly loud.  My office currently has 4 computers running, and the Hawking is louder than the rest combined.  I can't easily relocate the device to another room, so I end up powering this down when I don't need it.  Unfortunately, this defeats my original intent to run this 24x7 with regular automated backups from all machines.  On the other hand, given that \\\\\"real\\\\\" Network Attached Storage devices used to cost several thousands of dollars, this unit is amazingly cost effective.",

I use these drives to store my digital content which serves my Apple TV's via my 2011 Mac Mini.  Yes, I know the 2011 Mini is USB 2.0 but, the description clearly says it works with 2.0 and I wanted to be &#34;future proof&#34; for when I got a 2012 or newer Mini with USB 3.0.<br /><br />1st problem:  After installing my hard drives, as individual drive configuration, the Mac Mini immediately wanted to reformat them as the partitions weren't readable.  Disk Utility saw both disks perfectly fine.  I pulled each drive back out and retested with the individual enclosures and they worked.  At this point I was ticked so backed up both drives, put them back into this enclosure, reformatted both drives, then copied all my content back to each drive.<br /><br />2nd problem:  As I previously stated I use these drives to host my digital content.  After I got all my content restored I went on with some other business.  Later that day, I went to watch a movie and got an error.  Puzzled, I went to the Mac Mini and saw an error that both drives were improperly ejected.  I went to enclosure and only the power and hard drive 1 lights were on.  I turned the unit off and back on.  It worked and now I could watch my movie.  But the next time I went to watch a movie the exact same thing happened.<br /><br />Thinking maybe it was the USB cable, I got a new cable and experienced the same issues.  I then tried a different USB port on my Mini and again the same thing.  I called Vantec Support and they were puzzled too, so asked if they could call back in a little bit.  I said sure but, never got a call back after 2 days.<br /><br />Enough is enough.  I had my wife call Amazon to request a full refund.

This case fails in that respect.

That is frustrating in and of itself. I would overlook that if that were its only issue because as I said, it's an attractive design and one that I like.<br /><br />The case itself is extremely flimsy as opposed to the actual leather one that my fiance has - the case bends and creases which wouldn't be a problem except it will not stay shut. I cannot close my case because immediately it pops open which then defeats the purpose of the sleep/wake fuction which doesn't work on mine obviously as it won't close.<br /><br />There is also the fact some of the vinyl seems to be coming apart which is evidence of how cheaply made it appears to be.<br /><br />I would recommend sticking to the simple colors if you're going to order from this company. If you choose to go with the designs, just beware what you might actually get. In the meantime, I'll be returning mine sadly and probably look for another company to order my case from.",

What you really need is a company that will act like they are one of Microsoft's biggest customers, and tell Microsoft that their operating system has critical deficiencies, and that they need to fix it, instead of telling their customers that their PC user's agreement that they had to accept to use the machine, specifically exempts HP from supporting the machine \\\\\"for any specific purpose\\\\\", or supporting \\\\\"any external devices\\\\\" including their own! In other words... You're screwed! I've been trying to get my laptop to install a printer as a network printer. If I plug it directly into the laptop, it automatically searches, finds, and installs the driver and prints like a dream. But I bought a wireless laptop because I don't want to drag a printer around with it everywhere in the house! Windows 7's network printer wizard will search for the driver too, but can't find it! And I asked HP where the driver went that installed when I plugged the printer in directly, and I was told that they \\\\\"do not support external devices\\\\\", and that I should contact the printer manufacturer. The printer manufacturer has handed all of their legacy drivers over to Microsoft and only supports their newest products, so the issue, which IS a Windows 7 issue, should be covered as a Windows 7 issue. Since HP purchases Microsoft operating systems as an OEM (Origional Equipment Manufacturer), HP agrees to support the operating system. However, the only support they provide is telling you how to reinstall your operating system if it has become corrupted. Any other issues with the operating system that require someone to show you how to work around an operating system bug, will elicit an instruction, from the HP representative, to contact Microsoft or PAY HP to place a technician on the phone with you! They know that Microsoft will refer you backto the OEM (HP in this case) or purchase technical assistance as well.  Then there's that Kindergarten help and assistance \\\\\"software\\\\\" they put on the machine that is completely useless to anyone familiar with using a PC. I used to be able to search it to find out how to disable it, but now my search only returns the following:  1. Opening and moving Tablet PC Input Panel [This almost sounds a little relevant, but regards the touch screen of a tablet and this ain't one!]  2. How to Power your HP Notebook PC from an Automobile or Airplane  3. Turn User Account Control on or off  4. Purchase an HP Notebook PC Battery  5. Getting started with Internet Explorer 9  6. Purchase an HP Notebook PC AC Adapter  7. Make the keyboard easier to use  8. Understanding HP Notebook PC Batteries  9. Show or hide the menu bar in Windows Media Player  10. Enabling the Wireless Adapter  11. Add or delete desktop icons  12. HP Battery Check: frequently asked questions  13. Internet Explorer 9 keyboard shortcuts  14.

HP Power and Battery Learning Center  19. Make items on the screen appear bigger (Magnifier)  20. Removing and Replacing the Battery  21. What's new with the Windows 7 taskbar?  etc.  So if the above list is pretty much all you're looking for in PC support, then this is the product for you!

It seemed like an outrageously high price for just one, but the salesman said it was guaranteed for the life of the device. He also offered to install it for me, but the installation charge would have almost doubled the total price.<br /><br />The salesman told me to register the screen protector as soon as I got home, in order to begin its lifetime warranty. When I did, I was relieved that I didn't have to create and remember yet another password. The registration was based solely on my email address.<br /><br />When I got it all home, I discovered that installing a ZAGG is way more complicated than any I had encountered before. (One of the instructions I really did not like was the one that says not to turn the device on FOR 12 TO 24 HOURS AFTER INSTALLING THE SCREEN PROTECTOR, but that's a setback for the buyer regardless of who is doing the installation.) The process involves a special solution (included) and instructions on how to wet your fingertips to avoid getting prints on the screen. I decided to save myself the frustration.<br /><br />Nov. 1: I returned to the store and paid the exorbitant price to have this installed. With sales tax, this screen protector now cost close to forty dollars.<br /><br />As the salesman tried to put it on, he discovered it was scratched, so he took a second one off the rack and installed that instead. When he finished, I asked about the scratches (yes, the second one was also scratched) and he said they should \\\\\"work themselves out\\\\\" over the next day or so.<br /><br />Nov. 2: The scratches, of course, did not \\\\\"work themselves out.\\\\\" I returned to the store and the salesman installed a third ZAGG screen protector. When he finished, I noticed that the scratches on this third one were worse than the first two. He said the store clearly had a bad batch, and I should contact ZAGG, explain the problem, and have them ship me a replacement.<br /><br />I went back to the ZAGG website and was given two options to start the replacement process: sign in WITH PASSWORD, which I don't have because the original registration process did not ask for, or issue a password; or, the second option was to register my product (which I had already done). That was the first hangup.<br /><br />The second hangup was the cost of shipping. You have to pay to ship the bad screen to ZAGG, but you also have to provide a credit card number because there's a shipping and handling fee for the replacement. That's right. They won't just charge you shipping, they'll also charge you for the time it takes them to put the screen in the envelope ... and they DON'T TELL YOU how much that shipping and handling charge is going to be.<br /><br />Nov. 3: I took the screen protector and both receipts (the one for the protector, and the one for the installation) back to the store, and it got a little ugly for a few minutes. They wanted to refund the cost of the ZAGG but not the cost of the installation. I told them their alternative was to waste every sealed, scratched ZAGG on their rack until they were all gone, or they could refund both charges.<br /><br />They chose to refund both charges rather than have an empty ZAGG rack. In other words, they chose to continue to sell scratched ZAGGs to unsuspecting customers.<br /><br />I finally got out of there with my money, and came back to Amazon where I ordered a highly-rated competitor's screen protector. It's a set of two protectors that cost about twenty percent of what ZAGG charges for this one.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: This might be the best screen protector ever made. Who knows? I would have to try one that wasn't scratched, which this particular store couldn't deliver on. Aside from this one store's unfortunate batch of defective screens, the problems with ZAGG's \\\\\"lifetime guarantee\\\\\" were twofold:<br /><br />1. Their \\\\\"Who are you?\\\\\" attitude when it came time to log on to their site in order to deal with the problem (i.e., asking me for a password when there was no password involved in the original registration process).<br /><br />2. Their practice of pre-charging an unspecified shipping and handling fee. Not only do I not know how much that charge will eventually be, I also don't know how many times I would have to return the product (and get dinged for the shipping and handling fee) until they get it right.",

I originally thought the black band would go behind the case as well when opening, but it doesn't so it makes opening and closing slightly annoying.<br />-The other reason are the two pouches in the back, I liked the idea of it but it's easy for things to slip out of those back pockets. I wish there was a slightly larger slit on top of the opening so that it would extend over the pouch, which I believe would hold things in slightly more securely.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice sleeve to carry the laptop with a nice texture and color and the added accessory pouch is a nice bonus.

I would go through the setup wizard, it would recognize my wireless router, I would enter the passcode, and it would seem to go through the setup without a hitch.<br /><br />The problem was that my devices (and I tried a few) would say that the network was &#34;unknown&#34; and it wouldn't give me any internet access. I would try to pull up the device in a browser using the default IP, but it would never open. I don't know if I had a defective unit or what. I tried for a couple of hours before giving up.

The mounting bracket says it's patterned for 16&#34; studs, but the holes are actually a little off 16&#34;, and the holes that are that width are not centered on the mounting plate, so the rack mounts either a few inches left or right (your choice) of the centerline between the studs. That's really odd and seems like they could have done better with that. If you need to center over studs, I recommend you install plywood over the studs, then affix the rack to the plywood. Also, since the rack has some weight and you know some weight will get added to it, you'll be tempted to use lag bolts to affix the mounting plate. Unfortunately, the way the rack and the mounting plate mate for installation, it can't clear a big head on a lag bolt--you need to use something that has a fairly flat head. Seems like this is something they could have done better at, as well. It makes me wonder if they've tried installing their own rack. Still, once it's up, it looks great and does its job. Other minor gripes: the left and right side panels are not hinged, so the first time you remove them, hold on to the panel as you remove it--when you pop the latch, you may expect it to swing out as if hinged, but it will actually fall out and drop to the floor (with possible damage). The front door is removable, but if you remove it, there are two little plastic sleeves that center the hinge pins in their holes that can (will) quietly drop off and go... somewhere... where you spend... seemingly hours... on the floor... looking for it... and if you don't find them, the door won't sit straight or close smoothly. Those little sleeves should be SNAP in, not DROP in. After my first bad experience, I started tacking them into the rack with clear caulk, and I also put a warning label inside the door at the hinge pins as a future reminder/warning to watch out for and hold on to these important little parts when removing the door.",

We had high hopes for an improvement in this area with the DX but it is just more of the same.  The bigger issue is that Amazon refuses to ship the replacement overseas leaving me with a $500 paper weight.  My only options are to ship it back to a friend in the US, then get Amazon to ship the kindle to my friend, then have the friend ship it back here.      While I loved the device for the 3 days it worked, I am furious at the reliability issues.  The big reason to have this is to travel with but the reliability is just not at a point where you can count on in working for you.  Amazon is a great company, and the kindle and kindle store is a great concept, but I think Amazon should have left the consumer electronics business to the pro's and teamed up with Sony.

I have never had this issue in all my years using clickable scroll wheels.  That is more of a minor annoyance.

When this happens, there is no connection or IP address listed on the \\\\\"status\\\\\" page. This freezing occurs until I unplug the router or sometimes after 5 to 10 minutes it fixes itself. It is just not usable this way. Kyocera replaced the router under warranty and the problem is exactly the same. I did upgrade the firmware on both routers. This matter was escalated to D-Link support and they were unable to fix the problem. They are now looking into getting me a different model of router to resolve this. The U720 modem is new, so hopefully they will work the bugs out, but I wanted to make sure this information was available to other buyers. Both Kyocera and Verizon assured me the two units were compatible before I purchased them.

I wasn't worried about making a router \\\\\"work\\\\\" because I am in IT Networking, so a home network is much more simple.  I was wrong.<br /><br />On to the review:<br /><br />The good:<br />* The router sets up very easily.  It takes some time to figure out their interface, but after you do, it does make sense.  Just not very intuitive.<br />* The router looks good.<br />* The USB sharing function (attached USB disk drive) works much better than my old Netgear.<br />* The Range is better than my old Netgear.<br /><br />The bad:<br />* Documentation is little or non existent.  It wasn't a big deal for me because of my background, but I can see how some people who are not familiar with networking could be confused without it.<br />* Almost immediately, I had issues with my smart TV's and Satellite systems connecting (and staying connected) to the new router.  These devices included Samsung SmartTVs, iPad, HP Touchpad, Samsung Galaxy phones, HP laptops, Dell Desktops.  So, there's NOTHING in common between ANY of the issues except the router.<br />* Direct connections (non wireless) would hang; the router would just freeze and would not even be accessible by direct connection to 192.168.0.1.  The connection would time out.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />Support.  Good luck getting through.  On the last day before my 30 days post-purchase return with Amazon ended, I was on hold for 50 minutes before I spoke to someone.  I outlined my issues and she didn't know what to do so she put me on old to talk with her support.  When she finally returned she told me that the issue I am having is related to the way the router loses track of IP's that have been assigned causing conflicts (this is a KNOWN ISSUE that the F/W 1.01 upgrade was supposed to fix -- guess it did not).<br /><br />To explain a little more, there isan issue with the router keeping track of the IP addresses on the network.  Apparently this is only with DSL and dynamic connections.  Quite amazing if you ask me since the router should be smart enough to keep track of the MAC addresses, assign leases on IP's, and re-assign if needed. She told me that I'd have to call my ISP and get a login so that we could establish a PPoE connection. I told her, \\\\\"No thanks.  This is nuts.\\\\\"  Needless to say, I have returned the router.  I really wanted this router to work because honestly, I HATE returning items, but in this case, I had to.  I am really disappointed in the quality of this router and the lack of DLink Support.  I probably won't buy another DLink device again.<br /><br />I plugged in an OLD LinkSys model that I used years ago and the connections were stable (but slow).",

With those your Kindle was securely attached to the cover.  The previous generation's leather cover was also much higher quality.  It had some weight to it and felt like an old, leather bound book.  It also had just a bit of padding to it which I hope would help if I ever dropped it.  This new cover seems like the leather is just glued to the plastic so if you drop it almost all of the impact will be transferred to the Kindle.  I chose this cover because the new Kindle would just snap in instead of being held in by its corners.  But if I had it to do over again I'd get Acase's cover (which IS only $15) or one by Marware which looks like it has that old-school leather feel to it.",

Now, it wasn't my fault that it broke, but it was a known issue to Amazon at the time. The charging port was bad, and it simply wouldn't let me charge it. When I had contacted Amazon, they knew about the problem... But had insisted that I buy another one (the kindle fire HDX7&#34;). They would not send me a new one, even though my warenty wasn't up. They instead gave me a discount. Which I was reluctant to take. So I ordered the new kindle. Everything was fine for about a few months... Then one day I dropped it from about two feet. At first, the damage wasn't terrible, it had some cracks on the side of it. When I turned it on, to my dismay, I found that where the cracks had been the touch screen wouldn't respond. I did do some research and found out that unlike other tablets, the kindle fire HDX 7&#34; had the glass and touch pads under it, fused together. So that when a coach would happen, it would go through the glass and ruin the touch pads underneath. An iPad from Apple does not have this problem because the glass isn't fused or directly touching the touch pads/sensors. So me being a very clumsy person, dropped it again from about a foot onto carpet. It cracked again. The crack was a shallow one, but still it rendered the screen where it cracked useless. So now, I'm unable to use it. Because I can only access 1/4th of the screen. I had to shell out more money to buy an iPad mini. Which I'm very happy with, and with the whole kindle fire HDX 7&#34; incident, I proceeded to buy a case for the iPad. The kindle fire would have had five stars, if not that. The interface is great and the whole experience was great, from a technological standpoint. If Amazon would have tested it just that extra bit and dropped it from two - three feet on the corner, they probably would have caught the problem. But they unfortunately released a device that had a major problem. My advice to anyone that wants a &#34;cheap&#34; tablet, this is a good choice. But be careful with it...e that wants a &#34;cheap&#34; tablet, this is a good choice. But be careful with it...",

Unfortunately after using it to read books and linked to the TV through the HDMI port to watch movies, I noticed that the screen was cracked across the entire face. After countless emails with customer service, I finally sent the tablet back to see if the crack was covered under warranty. Guess what the answer was!! You guessed it; it's not covered. So they want me to pay to repair the screen and the shipping costs to get my tablet back. To add insult to injury, I sent the tablet back a month ago and the only way I could get a status update was to call the customer service guy every day to ask what they had determined.

I was nearly ready to place an order and I saw the YooMee leather case for $5.00 measly bucks! I thought what they hey, if it isn't perfect I'm not out much and it's worth the risk with free shipping right?<br /><br />So I just got my case/cover and when I put it on the center clips that you slide the Kindle under were  tight (which is a good thing) except that the top center clip must have a very sharp edge up under where you cannot see and it actually gouged a sliver of the Kindles plastic edge off which now makes it less than perfect which is the main reason I purchased the case to start with, its a minor thing to some people but to me, I care very well for my electronics and this really bothers me.<br /><br />But wait that's not all; the case may fit tight under the two center clips (top and bottom) but it is very vague on fitting into all four corners so really the only thing keeping it from falling out are the two center clips ( one top one bottom). The worst part though is that the fixed clasp that is made to hold the cover shut, doesn't work! It barely closes far enough to stay shut and the least about of pressure and it just pops open. I might as well not have a clip to hold the cover shut. It is either to loose or too short or both but either way, it's a design flaw and to make matters worse the cover has already started to develop a slight bowe which I'm sure will make the clasp completely useless in a very short time. No matter what the clasp is just a waste and would never protect it if you dropped it because it would flip open mid air. Lastly the leather stitching on the edge has a place that is coming loose or rather never was sewn well to start with.<br /><br />So, is it worth $5.00 bucks? Well if you didn't care that the case scratched the Kindles edge, and all you have to spend in the world is $5.00 on a case then I guess it's worth it.<br />For me, it was NOT worth it! I've dameged my beautiful new Kindle and wasted time fooling with this.<br /><br />This is really too bad because I like the feel of the case, if it just fit better and closed well it would be an awesome deal even at $20. But there are so many options under $20. this one just failed!<br /><br />If you order this I wish you better luck than I've had. Maybe I got a bad case, but really? do you think that another one could be much different.<br /><br />You make the value judgement, as for me, I'm back in the market for a good case again.<br /><br />Peace.",

Sometimes I don't need the screen, but have limited space, I have to put the case aside.<br /><br />That last con is why I only use the keyboard at home, it's no so much an issue with durability yet, but I see signs of wear in just a month, but I often take my iPad the gym for reading while I'm on the elliptical.  I place the iPad on the stand, but if I bring the keyboard, I can't place the case on the back of the iPad, I have really no place to put the case when I dont need a keyboard since it can't sit neatly inside.  That was a primary reason that caused me to own both a keyboard case and a regular iPad dust cover.  For this reason, I also recommend some Brookstone keyboards which solve my cons above, but add bulk which I didn't want.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Nearly 2 years later, I barely use this keyboard now because of the inconvenience of not having a place to put the case, and also the iPad was new to me then, I no longer find typing on screen any bit of a challenge.

I have gone through all of the hard reset tricks and configurations on the Cisco support site. The COMCAST repair tech was here and confirmed the router is dead. He has seen many dead linksys routers and recommmended NETGEAR. I believed the Cisco gear would be the best, but this is NOT their commercial grade technology. AVOID IT.<br /><br />OLDER (from 2007) I gave 3-stars here.<br />I recently purchased the WRT600N N-series to replace a D-link g-series wireless router.  I wanted a Cisco product (quality) to avoid the random connection issues I had experienced with prior products.  This WRT600N has both 2.4 and 5GHZ bands to operate simultaneously. I also purchased the WPC600N notebook adapter that was specifically designed to work with the router. My wife and I depend on a strong signal so we can actually do work and not play wireless connection debug. I am running Vista and she has XP. I specifically went for the 5GHz product, which I expected to have a greater signal strength farther from the router.<br />Impressions:<br />1)The 5GHz signal is weaker than the 2.4Ghz signal far from the router where it is supposed to be stronger.<br />2) The router install program did not work. Just use 192.168.1.1 directly to configure it.<br />3) I don't feel it was worth the extra expense since the 5ghz signal is NOT stronger.<br />Recommendation: By a 2.4 GHz product and use the wireless adapters built into your laptop.",

BELKIN will not enclose a pre paid return UPS label.with the replacement camera. Just a feedback on my experience with BELKIN.",

It bothers my husband and I both enough that I'm going to look for a different kind of case.  Other than that, we'd have no complaints about it.<br /><br />Edit:  Also want to add this:  The part of the case that's cut away on the side to allow the USB/thunderbolt/power plug to plug in isn't quite low enough for the thunderbolt, at least on our case.  We'd been having trouble keeping the thunderbolt cable plugged in - we would walk on eggshells when backing up the laptop to an external hard drive because the slightest little jostle and the thunderbolt cable would disconnect from the computer (not physically knock it out of the port but disconnect from the standpoint of data transfer so we'd get that scolding message from the computer).  We thought it was a problem with the thunderbolt port being loose, but we eventually figured out that the case was pushing up the thunderbolt plug ever so slightly - barely visible unless we looked for it, but enough to decrease how securely the thunderbolt plug held in the port.",

The copy protection and authorization problems with the lone compatible UHD & HDR retailer (M-Go) is very faulty. Do an Internet search for some long forum threads of all the customers not able to get things to work on their 2015 and 2014 Samsung TVs. It is a terrible customer experience. After many lost hours I was able to get things to work partially. The problem then becomes that the only compatible retailer (M-Go) heavily throttles the download speed for UHD movies. It takes 20+ hours to download no matter how fast your Internet connection. And downloads sometimes fail at 92% or so and you have to start all over. There are more problems but by now you probably get the point.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you are one of the lucky ones and able to authorize and view compatible UHD HDR content, you will be very pleased. The quality of colors and light are unlike anything we have ever seen before. It is not that exciting to go from HD to UHD. By comparison, it is amazing to go from non-HDR anything to UHD HDR. The images in movies are just beautiful and it reveals a new level of lifelike presentation previously not available in the consumer living room.<br /><br />My advice is beware. Don't by this unless you can withstand the pain of making it work or perhaps waiting weeks or months until firmware or M-Go app updates fix all the problems. It works better with M-Go than the similar Samsung UHD pack but it does not work well for most consumers. In time there will be more providers and more authorized retailer options to download the UHD 4K content which is visually just as good as the future 4K blu-ray content will be. Average file size of movies with this device is 85 gb or so. This is the same data size that 4K blu-ray will use.",

Less of an issue yet still annoying, but I'm &#34;spoiled&#34; with how the Apple Magic Mouse's button clicks sound (muffled and low pitched). The N700's though are even worse, they're quite loud and high pitched (maybe I can muffle them somehow...). I just press a lot of mouse buttons and I like a quiet environment, so loud and high pitched mouse clicks get annoying very fast.<br /><br />If the mouse wouldn't have the above flaws and would be a laser (or possibly have both, laser and existing sensor) mouse and if it would reconnect like the N700 does (heck, I can do with a mouse button press!), it'd be my favorite mouse, due to its shape and, once configured and set to the minimum value with the windows app for the MS Arc Touch mouse, I like the vibrating feedback when scrolling, which the N700 doesn't do. Also that middle area needs to be wider and perhaps slightly arched, so you can feel immediately where to go with your finger to scroll. Can't be that difficult to implement, right?<br /><br />So now I'm deciding on returning it - I don't need 3 bluetooth mice laying around!

Also, it frequently freezes while I'm on pinterest or another app and shuts the app down, which is also quite annoying.  I also don't like that you can't tell exactly how much battery you have left.  You can kind of tell with the little battery symbol, but you can't tell the exact percentage until it sends you an alert.  Also, the battery doesn't last nearly as long as my Sero7's battery, so you have to recharge it much more frequently, which makes it less useful.  These are issues that my Sero7 never had.  My Sero7's problem (in case you are interested) was that after 6 months it wouldn't connect to the internet, and I sent it in to get fixed since it was still under warranty.  Then 6 months later it would no longer charge and couldn't be fixed (and the warranty had just expired).  But it was great on a daily basis.",

I think that some of these 5 star reviews must be fake because this mouse isn't at all a proper gaming mouse.<br /><br />I bought this mouse to use with a budget gaming system I built and I was lured by the fact that it is advertised as having an Avago 5050 optical sensor, and Omron switches.  I thought that the low price of this mouse was simply due to the fact that it wasn't from a major name brand gaming mouse manufacturer.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  The mouse arrived today and after plugging it in, I sat there for a minute moving it around to see how well it tracks.  Sadly, the sensor in this mouse is either not an authentic Avago 5050 or it is somehow defective.  When moving the mouse at any DPI higher than the lowest setting of 800, the mouse pointer is jumpy and feels like the mouse is applying some kind of artificial acceleration.  It felt exactly as if you were to max out the mouse pointer speed in the Windows mouse settings so that the pointer jumps multiple pixels at a time and cannot move precisely at all.  This happened at 6/10 pointer speed in Windows 7 and without &#34;Enhance pointer precision&#34; enabled.<br /><br />The second issue I noticed right away was the tracking when quickly whipping the mouse across the mousepad like you'd do when playing an FPS and need to turn around 180 degrees very quickly.  In this case, the mouse pointer would simply stutter around in place when applying too much sudden physical acceleration to the mouse across the surface.  I have a basic Logitech optical non-gaming mouse that I use with a Linux machine that does this exact thing when moving it too quickly.<br /><br />Both issues I mentioned above happen regardless of the surface the mouse is on.  I tried it on a Kingston HyperX &#34;Control&#34; hard mousepad, a SteelSeries QcK cloth pad, and on my bare desk with the same results.<br /><br />Things I like about the mouse are that the shape and design are pretty good and feel comfortable in my average-sized male hands.  I did not have any problems with the scroll wheel like some of the negative reviewers mentioned, and the buttons all felt pretty good for such a cheap mouse.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this mouse.  I guess this is a classic example of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;",

Heat rises, and the intake on these fans isn't strong enough to pull it back down and push it out.  That means you can catch the heat from other expansion cards (like video cards), but the hottest parts of the computer get a very limited cooling effect.      If you have your tower in a desk enclosure it's worse.  The fan slots can't be angled to blow the air out of the enclosure.  That puts all the hot air around the back of case, which heats both the air back there and also heats up the wood or metal in back of the desk enclosure, so most of the heat gets pulled right back inside the case again.  Using two (or more) of these helps a little by creating a better, stronger, air flow.  Using them with a conventional add-on case and/or power supply fan (like the Nexus Real Silent Case fan) helps much more.  Just don't expect that adding only one of these by itself is going to make a whole lot of difference overall.",

Another happily took the visor but shunned the scanner.Getting each peripheral to work together at the same time was impossible.

I bought this to be used mainly as an ereader<br />and so far the screen resolution is amazing. I'd say it's equal to or even better than tablets in the $500-600 range.<br />Battery is above average.<br /><br />Cons- Screen responsitivity, screen sensitivity (screen feels kinda rough), slow and laggy, crashes.<br /><br />The touch and feel of the screen is horrible, especially when typing. I wish someone told me this before buying. It's very important to me how the screen feels. But I'm willing to deal with it. The screen is also slow in responding to the user's inputs. It's not that slow....but it is noticeable. I am typing this review on it and can definitely notice it. The speed is an issue I didn't expect. It definitely doesn't feel like a quad core processor. My phone with a 1.5ghz dual core processor and 1gb of ram is much faster. If you have a lot of tabs open you can notice the speed suffer, that shouldn't be happening with 2gb of ram and a quad core processor. It also crashed within the 2nd day I got it. It froze and even the power button wasn't able to turn it off haha. In all seriousness, this is a cause for worry and I hope it doesn't happen again.<br /><br />Basically, if you want this as an ereader like me go for it. It will also work fine for browising the web and watching videos. But if you're looking for a general purpose tablet I would recommend something more expensive.",

(Disregard my comments if you're doing a software flash and expect plug and play reliability.  In that case, steer clear.  Your drive might be OK, but my solder joints were bad.)<br /><br />That said, I hate being lied to.  Seller is intentionally misleading--this condition is no accident.  Drive is sold as new with anti-tamper stickers on the case. It's specifically targeted at home Xbox repair, where buyers will open it up. Upon opening the case (making it non-returnable I'm sure), there's dust inside the drive. Worse, the PCB was apparently soldered by my 9-year old or a monkey on meth (not necessarily mutually exclusive).  See photos of the globs of solder & burned wires.<br /><br />Thankfully, I didn't need that ratty PCB anyway, though clean wires would have been nice.  Mechanically, the drive seems to be sound and has worked for the past few hours as my kids play their games on DVD.  However, I paid for new, not poorly refurbed. Again, I hate being lied to.",

On the negative side, the material on the corners has started to come undone. I don't give this case very much use at all - the only time it really leaves my house is on Sundays for church. So, its lasted me about 2 months and its time to find another. Also, I realized that I can watch videos while it is charging, I just have to fold it the way opposite it was intended. Unfortunately, this has the bottom of the screen resting on the front of the case, so there's nothing there to keep it from slipping, but if its just sitting on a table or something, this shouldn't be too much of a problem.",

Nice appearance and very fast, especially when using the firewire 800 connection.  However, a hard drive is something that can't be nice just when it works, which is the case with this drive.  Now that I own two of these with no real solutions to get them to work all the time I am on the verge of trashing both of them.  The amount of time I have spent trying to determine what is wrong with these drives is totally unaccceptable.  The LaCie tech support people are all very nice, but I still have 2 LaCie drives that do not work.  The problems started shortly after purchase of each.  Even though the older of the two drives has had the same problems unresolved now for over a year, I was told by LaCie tech support last week that they will have to charge me to repair that drive.  That simply adds insult to injury.  I have four other external hard drives from different manufacturers and have had no problems with any of them.  Having had a major problem with both LaCie drives seems to indicate an intrinsic problem with these drives.  There is also the problem of firmware updates.  They had an update for the drives to be used with Windows XP service pack 2, yet did not send out any notice to customers even though they have customers name and email addresses.  I only found the update by accident when checking the LaCie site.  This is another catch-22:  YOu need the firmware update for the drives to work with service pack 2 but the update must be done on a computer without the service pack installed.  I tried to do the update as the LaCie tech recommended, but it failed on both hard drives.  Essentially I have two large drives that are only recognized by Windows occassionally.  If you don't mind a hard drive that only works a little bit of the time, then this is a good drive and will look nice.  But if you happen to need a reliable hard drive that you can depend on, then stay away from these LaCie drives at all costs. <br />",

(2) The edge padding around the laptop portion of it is great. (3) It is very well made, with no huge quality issues to speak of. (4) It is light for a bag its size.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />(1) The shoulder strap being mounted on different sides on each end. For me, this makes it slide off my shoulder much easier while I'm trying to move through the airport or whatever. (2) THE ZIPPERS! (this is almost a quality issue, but not quite). If they have hardly any tension on them at all from the pockets being full, they pull a part when you try and zip them anyway. Then you have to try and get the zipper back the other way, etc... This is very frustrating. For a bag this well made, better zippers would've been great. (3) The two carry handles have no way to fasten them together so they can stay together. So if you want to pull it off your shoulder, you either have to set it down and then grab the handles from each side individually, or, just grab one while it's on your shoulder and then try and grab the other while the bag is hanging from the first one. It's kind of like trying to comb your hair with your off-hand and a one-tooth comb. You can do it, but it's not as easy. However, the last two dislikes would keep me from buying another one.<br /><br />Overall, I would give it a 5 out of a 10. A very well made bag (minus the zippers), for the price. It just needs some revisions here and there to make it more user friendly...in my opinion.",

I guess I'm used to a high quality system in the living room, so I was a bit put off when I first heard them :-) Basically it's kind of a muddy mess. But then again - those are computer speakers for my office not an audiophile setup, so, after adjusting my expectations - here's what I think:    Pros:  - Reasonably detailed (for computer speakers)  - Loud (Not sure if that's a pro, but for my - relatively small office - those are very loud - I can do parties there now)    Cons:  - No off switch  - Don't get me started on the blue neon light, I'm constantly fighting urges to take it out with a shotgun  - The bass     And this is my main issue with those speakers - is blown out of any proportions. And it's not even a good punchy bass - it's just a mess of a low-mid frequency noise really. Even when turned all the way down with the Bass knob it is still way overpronounced. So, I took a bunch of toilet paper and stuffed it into the peer ports on top of the speakers. That helped.    Bottom line:  - If you want something for a dorm room - those are OK, although I bet you can find something with a punchier bass.   - If you want to listen to jazz/blues/anything highs-mids rich really - skip this one.   - If you need those for listening to windows startup sounds, Voip, youtube and online training sessions - OK, but be prepared to stuff the peers full of paper and turn the bass all the way down.",

Linksys 4 weeks after being notified by the US-CERT has failed to provide a simple firmware fix that would enable a user to actually disable WPS.  SHAME ON YOU LINKSYS.  Also with the current firmware (which is months old now), the USB port is basically broken.  If you flash to Tomato or DD-WRT to get rid of WPS you will loose other router functionality.   If you get the V2 model right now, you're going to loose the ability to flash Tomato or DD-WRT.  If you get a V1 you can flash to Tomato or DD-WRT but you're are going to LOOSE functionality (SSH, the USB port an antenna, etc).  You also have to be really careful to avoid bricking the E4200.  It's a very touchy router in this regard.  The WPS issue actually applies to every router Linksys makes.  All they have to do is fix the 'disable WPS' option so it works.  One month later they haven't even made a statement about it.  Your next door neighbors 10 year old can figure out how to launch the Reaver WPS attack after 15 minutes of reading and will be in your network within 6 hours.    Again:  SHAME ON YOU LINKSYS!",

It's done this a few other times-maybe once a month or so, but I assumed it was my cable modem as is usually the case. I called to have that issue addressed and discovered it was the router this time. I tried all the trouble shooting methods I know of-no solutions. I went online and tried a few of those and was instructed to update firmware. How can I do that if I can't connect my computer to the internet? I was on the phone-on hold mostly-with tech support for a total of 65 minutes and only talked to the rep for about 5 when she told me I'd have to pay extra for tech support because it's outside the warranty time (hasn't been a year) She instructed me to go online and download firmware-which I tried already and if that didn't work then I'd have to buy a new one. She tried to tell me also that I maybe damaged the router so that could be the issue-not at all true. Then said well sometimes they (routers) just malfunction and they don't really know why-HUH? I asked do they replace it if it's still within the one year warranty and she said no. At some point in the long 5 min. call she hung up on me and my only resolution was to uninstall everything and reinstall and manually search for updated firmware on the new install. 2 hours later it was working! I purchased this so I didn't have to keep doing things like I was but it looks like spending nearly $100 for better equipment means nothing. Regretting this purchase now and waiting for more issues to begin.<br />Down grading the review rating because the tech support sucks and while the router works great, if it's not going to work all the time it's worthless so I need to search for a replacement already.<br /><br />Purchased this a few months ago and wished I had done so years ago. Our wireless cable internet was crap to the max and we are stuck with it since we live in a newer subdivision. I was resetting the modem or wireless router or reconfiguring settings once a week. At the recommendation of the head of IT at my job I purchased one of these and connected it to a regular cable modem and haven't had to do a thing (besides shorten my daughter internet time) since.<br />Set up took less than 10 minutes (I'm good with tech but the instructions were VERY simple).<br />Lots of controls like having a guest wireless access point with a separate password, parental controls, adding a printer and optional cloud storage and more I haven't played around with yet.<br />We have a about 7 wireless devices including gaming systems and TV on the router and haven't had any major issues. I will say that a few time three devices, one being the DTV box, was streaming movies and everyone ran a little slow but that's to be expected with the service I have here.<br />We can connect from all over the house, in fact I pick up my wifi when I'm pulling in the garage and sitting on my back patio and the router is at the front of the house.<br />Wish it were cheaper, but for now it's well worth the money.",

It even intercepts and discards DNS lookups to outside servers like Google's 8.8.8.8, so manually changing the router or computer's DNS settings does not help.

Not only has this been terribly time consumming, but at the price ($189) I do not expect to run into these kind of troubles.  I have been a very satisfied customer using Linksys products in the past but this aftercare service by Linksys tech support and non-functional product has driven me to inform all of you that care to know, to be very aware that this product and it's representatives are not all they promise to be.  Their tech support is seperated by levels, the higher the level the more knowledgable they are supposed to be - not so!  They couldn't even realize 2hrs into the conversation after having asked me already that I was working of Windows Vista!  Back to the router :-)  The range is not all that grand for a supposed 5ghz router.  I use it for gaming as well and have not found any problems with it.  When I move my laptop around however, just a good 10+ yds from the router and you can loose some serious speed.  So again, be wary about this one.  For the price there has to be a better router than this...ideas are definitely welcomed, especially if anyone knows of a router that has the capability to allow USB connections....",

I was excited when I read about a new and improved Kraken that was made specifically for the new iPad, as Trident set the bar high in regards to the Kraken that was available for the original iPad and iPad 2 and offered unbeatable protection. After getting the Kraken AMS in the mail and using it for about a week, I find several glaring issues that should Trident should have fixed before sending the Kraken AMS to market. The AMS case consists of a soft silicon sleeve that wraps around the iPad for protection, and two outer layers that snap around the silicon sleeve for added `shell' protection. The old Kraken case had two plastic clips and hinges that were, admittedly ugly, but VERY functional. The new AMS case's plastic outer shell simply snaps together without the use of any type of secure fasteners. This leaves the entire iPad (case and all) to have a very low level of protection in a drop or fall. The two outer plastic shell pieces on my AMS case barley stay secured in simple daily use - I'd hate to think of what might happen to my expensive iPad3 if I was to drop it! The other major issue that the new Kraken AMS case has is the poor design of the silicon `plugs' for the earphone port and charger/syncing port. The inner soft silicon case for the AMS has two plugs of material that serve to cover the two ports on the new iPad. While the idea is sound, I find that when using the iPad in landscape mode, my hands constantly pop the silicon charger/syncing plug out of place. This is due to a poor design, and Trident should be ashamed that they have allowed their newest, `prized' ultra-rugged case to have such major flaws. For $60, there are several cases that would be a much better choice to protect your $500+ iPad3 investment, and I urge those considering this case to keep looking.",

Nice screw-less system for mounting DVD drives and hard drives. Acceptable build quality, but a little tipsy until you install the bottom-mounted PSU.<br /><br />USB 3.0, The motherboard for this build hasn't arrived yet, so I haven't tested its functionality yet, but I like how they point straight up. I must say that they do flex down a little when a USB device is plugged into them and I wish they were sturdier.<br /><br />The wire management is nice, but not groundbreaking.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The latch that pegs into and holds the DVD/CD drives has a tendency to pop out at its hinge before the correct end snaps free. Not a serious issue since it doesn't actually break (just keep this in mind while opening it) and because most people will only need to open/close this once in the case's lifetime.<br /><br />The side panels, although secured by convenient thumb screws (read: screwdriver not required), they are thin, flimsy and the way they lock into the front end of the case sucks. You have to lay the whole thing down on its side to ensure that they are properly inserted. Again, not a major issue since most people will not open the sides unless they are upgrading/replacing a part.<br /><br />The tabs on the back for expansion devices snap off (by design), so be SURE of which ones you need to take off for video/sound/network cards because you can't securely put them back in.<br /><br />The orange 140mm fan that was pictured, but not mentioned in the description, is NOT included! Seriously bummed about this one. The description was disappointingly brief I don't like being mislead.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to test it yet, but I'm not very optimistic about the air filter's ability to keep out dust. It's really just a flimsy piece of finely-perforated plastic that clips into the bottom of the case. Another filter, white and apparently non-removable, is stuck behind the front grille for aesthetic purposes. Since all the other vents are left open, it would appear that the builder is supposed to install separately-purchased case fans in all 8 vents, all in an exhaust orientation to pull fresh air through the poorly conceived filters. This is a case that you could conceivably spend more money by plugging all the vents with fans than you did on the case itself. Don't get me wrong, doing that would turn this thing into a chilly wind tunnel, but very few people have a need for that kind of air flow and those that do will not choose this case. Since I am NOT going to drop $80 in fans into this, I foresee the unused vents creating a serious dust problem over time.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Comparable cases made by Xigmatek's competitors, such as the Antec 300, come with several fans, more robust mounting systems, nifty removable side panels that swing on a hinge and superior air filters. It's not that I *wouldn't* recommend this case, it's that there are so many better cases out there in the same price range.",

Windows boots so fast that the Windows logo doesn't even get to finish forming before the next screen and the Windows startup sound is cut short as the computer blazes through load screens.  Programs load very fast even upon first time runs...like they were already loaded into memory and then some.<br /><br />But when I used CrystalDiskBenchmark, my write speed was only about 80MB/s.  Sure enough, I tried copying a large folder from one area of the drive to the other and Win 7 showed a consistent write speed of about 80MB/s.  I called tech support which is of course out of the country (Costa Rica) and unable to do anything but read from a script.  They told me I needed to use a benchmarking tool that uses compressible data.  So I did, and of course the MAX write speed on one out of a dozen tests that were performed reached about 500MB/s write speed.  That's cool and all, but obviously that's not the type of data being used by Win 7 for normal tasks, so why is that data used to advertise Intel's write speeds?  Oh, because it's like 6X what the drive will actually be performing at in your computer.  I thought this was pretty shady, and since I actually do copy large files fairly often, I had to take off two stars for poor performance and really useless tech support.<br /><br />TECH SUPPORT + UPDATE:  They are so useless that they didn't even suggest I update my SATA controller by downloading and installing the latest Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver.  This is different than the drive's firmware.  This seems to have increased my write speeds to hovering right about 100MB/s.  Still about 400MB/s under what the box claims I should expect.

I would buy this computer instantly w/ no complaints if Sony addresses these minor gripes. <br /> <br />- Include Core 2 Extreme Processor QX6700 - 2.66 GHz <br />- Include High Definition Optical Drive - Blue-Ray Drive <br />- Include Internal / Built-in ATSC HD TV tuner <br />- Include HDMI & Component Video Inputs <br />- Include Built-in IR receiver <br />- Include Vista Business Edition / Media Center PC Edition <br /> <br />If not including these features, at least allow the consumers to have some say in the final configuration of the unit. I do realize Sony intention for its all-in-one desktop to never upgrade, but the next edition should be provided w/ an accessible bay in the back, so that consumers don't have to deal w/ their lame customer service support if there is a problem w/ the optical drive or the hard drive. <br /> <br />Sony, addresses these concern & I'll be the 1st to buy. Otherwise, this model would fall gravely short of Sony's selling motto \\\\\"When space is at a premium, power is a necessity, & beauty is a must.\\\\\" <br /> <br />Sony has always been a leader in pricing for products against similar competition. Thus, it only makes sense that we expect Sony to incorporate the right features at the right price, with the competition in mind please. <br /> <br />In regard to comparable products: <br /> <br />-- Apple iMac (24-inch): <br />1st of all it has a 24\\\\\" Cinema display == Larger & Brighter screen <br />Display supports up to 1920-by-1600 Resolution == That's 1080p folks <br />Sony's 1680 X 1050 Resolution == Short of 1080p standard <br />Intel Core 2 Duo T7600 == Much better than Sony's T5600 <br />Can Run both Mac OS X & Window XP via Boot Camp Beta <br />500 GB Hard drive == Twice the size of Sony's hard drive <br />nVidia GeForce 7600 GT Graphics card == Better than Sony's 7400 GT <br /> <br />Apple iMac 24-inch offers much better features for the same exact price. So folks ask yourself how in the world can Sony expect someone to buy something like this for $2000. Perhaps this prior statement will not apply to those willing to doll out the money for just the stylish look of the LS25e. <br /> <br />Sony's Laptop & Desktop have been outfitted w/ Blue-Ray drive since summer 2006. Even WinBook Jiv Mini can integrate the IR receiver & TV tuner into the unit & also have DVI & Video component inputs. There is no excuse for Sony not being able to do these things that competitors can offer. Basically, there is only 1 conclusion: Sony Does have the Capability / but Does Not have the Will to do it.  LS25E is at best a Semi-all-in-one desktop, not the true All-in-One Desktop that it should be at this time and age.",

I wanted to use them to play music from my iPod in my room.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Long cords that allow flexibility - I needed one satellite to be on one side of my bed and another to be on the other side of my bed w/ the subwoofer in the middle.  I have a queen bed and the speakers reached with a little tweaking.<br /><br />Acceptable sound quality - If there's one thing I hate in reviews, it's when people say \\\\\"it doesn't have _____\\\\\" or \\\\\"This product isn't product x\\\\\".  While it's not the best, you're only paying $30... for that price range, these speakers produce sound quality that fits that range.  I'd say that they are better than my Logitech Z313s that I have for my computer ($55).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Too much bass - The bass coming out of the subwoofer is pounding.  Good if you like it.  For me, I find that the tonal balance gives too much bass.  Side note, the satellites produce pretty low tones which is weird.<br /><br />The control knob on the speaker is too heavy - hard to turn it without holding the speaker or having the speaker secured to whatever it's sitting on.  Not a fan... for me, not being able to adjust volume with one hand is really annoying.<br /><br />The line-in for the speakers feels cheap.<br /><br />Overall:<br />For $30, it's a good product, but I wouldn't tell you to \\\\\"buy it, buy it, buy it!\\\\\".  It's not a steal.  However, it's a solid product that offers adequate sound quality for the price.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?<br />No.  For me, the amount of bass is an issue.  I'd probably buy Logitech Z313s again if I didn't mind paying an extra Jackson for the speakers. If you put a gun to my head and gave me $35, I'd get these, I suppose.  Maybe I'd find some way to disable the bass (this won't ruin the sound b/c the satellites put out some bass as well).",

The tablet was fast enough for our use, and was very user friendly. If we HAD to complain about something, it would only be that tablet takes 4+ hours to fully charge.<br />However, less than one month after having it, the screen on the tablet went completely blank. For the past week, we have been working with the customer service / IT department to figure out a resolution. They have asked us perform numerous tasks (ie. plug the table into our computer using a USB port for 6 hours, plug the tablet into the regular charger for 20 mins, take &#34;pictures&#34; of the problem - which is just a blank screen- etc), and then they require us to call back afterwards so that they can continue to help us. After speaking with them 5+ times, they finally agreed that we should return the tablet so it can be either repaired or replaced. They were to send us an e-mail, and asked that we fill it out and return it, so that they could send a shipping label. However, we had to call them 2x to request for them to send the e-mail because we hadn't yet received it. We finally received their email and are now awaiting a shipping label, however WE have to pay for the return shipping. They reps are very difficult to understand and they seem as though they couldn't care less about our issue. In  the meantime...my daughter has only used the tablet a handful of times and is awaiting patiently to have it back.<br />Our household owns numerous electronic devices and we have never had an issue like this before. We thought we would try a Hannspree tablet because the price was reasonable for my daughters first tablet, and the size (10.1 inch)  and GB were ideal for what she needed. This is the first Hannspree product we have purchased, and it will be our last. I would recommend to anyone looking for a tablet or iPad to spend a little extra money and purchase one that will last. I am hoping the tablet can be repaired and we can get it back soon, but so far I am very disappointed in the way things have turned out.<br /><br />I will provide an update once the issues have been resolved.",

It wasn't the color red that I saw from Amazon. This seemed deeper like crimson and the picture doesn't represent that. Not a bad thing though, I still love this color.<br />2. The smell once I pulled it from the packaging was super strong. So if you have a sensitive nose like me, be ware. Probably should air it out for a day or two in case it has toxic chemicals.<br />3. It doesn't fit my iPad 2 around the trim. As in the hard case part does not envelope the iPad completely. Which makes me wonder if my parents told me it was the wrong iPad series. I'm going to wait to see if my spouse can fix it though before i return it.<br /><br />Because of #3 I couldn't really test out the stand or the strap.

However the buttons are EXTREMELY stiff - you have to really push on them to get a click to register, and doing a double-click is hard.  Particularly since it is EXTREMELY sensitive to movement, so pushing hard enough to click twice in a row is likely to joggle it enough to move the trackball a little causing the mouse pointer to move causing the doubleclick to fail and you have to start over.  The buttons are in entirely the wrong place - the wheel is behind them.  A natural placement of the hand means moving the trackball with the tips of the index and middle finger, and clicking the left button with the thumb.  However this means you are pressing against a part of the button quite far from the part intended to be clicked.  Even if you try clicking with the index finger, if you're using the tip of your middle finger to move the trackball, your clicking finger is still behind the trackball and far from the part of the button that one should be pressing on.  I can't imagine how they let this through their QA and customer focus groups, it is very nearly unuseable.  The shape of the device - with the trackball projecting high above - leads to an odd positioning of the hand that in turn leads to new repetitive stress.  Also the cursor speed is very high, much higher than what \\\\\"feels\\\\\" like a similar movement with a mouse.  Easily one of the most frustrating pieces of hardware I've worked with.

The stand does allow angling up (but not down), but that still means the ergonomics here are awful. (I do see that there are TWO holds in half of a VESA mounting pattern. So the monitor could in a pinch be hung. But since the bottom isn't supported, that means common movements of the monitor while hung in a monitor arm will pull on the two mounting screws & eventually in a loud & perhaps catastrophic way. It also means the monitor cannot be used vertically in any manner whatsoever).<br /><br />Also, I note that this product has an inferior warranty of only one year.

It has been quite an experience!<br /><br />First you should know that this is NOT a router/modem combo which means that you will need a separate modem.  Netgear is not at fault for my lack of reading skills, but I went to install it and realized I needed a new modem as well, so take note.  At first it looked fine and all the devices connected to the internet without any problems.  I thought we were good to go, until we tried to set up the wireless printer the next day.<br /><br />Thus begins the saga of missing network, because, while all the devices could get on the internet, they couldn't see each other at all.  We rely on a wireless printer and pull documents from one computer to the other, so this morning I set out on a quest to discover the issue.<br /><br />Be aware the setup website that Netgear gives you in the N600 instructions may not work, so try 192.168.1.1 if you have problems.<br /><br />Obviously, I made sure that all the devices were set to be discoverable, then I tried disabling the firewall.  No Luck.<br /><br />I found out that Windows 7 Homegroup communicates through IPV6 so you have to make sure that is enabled on your computers.  Then I discovered that IPV6 is not automatically enabled on the Netgear N600 Router, so you need to enable that in the \\\\\"advanced setup\\\\\" area on the router.  You will have to do this step if you want to do a Homegroup, but it still didn't solve my problem.<br /><br />I also enabled UPnP for good measure, but it wasn't that.  The final answer, drum roll please, was to uncheck the box titled \\\\\"Wireless Isolation\\\\\" in the router set up. (You also want to make sure your SSID is unhidden).  It took me several hours on the internet to troubleshoot this problem and in the end I was victorious, but I would rather have spent my day enjoying my family.<br /><br />To sum up; if you don't have Windows 7, use a wireless printer or care about networking, then this router may work well for you.  If you are a tech guy (or gal) who needs dual band, and is good at setup, this may be a great router.<br /><br />On the other hand if are looking for an easy way to network your devices in Windows 7, you may want to check out other options.<br /><br />If this was helpful to you please mark it as \\\\\"helpful\\\\\", so others see it as well.

The 30G system is horrible and if you use it and move your mouse to fast it cant track for s*** so disable it and better use DPI change when you need to.    The software lack's alot of features that should be like you can set 6 diffrante DPI and change them on the FLY but the program not only not show's you what is your current DPI it also don't let you set it all 6 at once and its weird as hell.  and the ability to program all the key's should be an apstion just if you playing a game that your DPI dont need to change it gives you 2 extra keys is amazing.

If you are reading in the dark or a not so well lighted room, the lower part of the Kindle is just too dark.  They should have added a smaller, similar light to the middle left side of the cover to assist with this problem.  Overall, it is good.  But they could have lowered the price by $20.  Also a note for those looking to protect their Kindle from the outside elements.....this product is not for you.  This cover merely closes, but does not zip closed.  It would be better if it actually closes and protects the Kindle from the outside elements.  If you are looking for something like that, then buy something that actually closes.

At 2 G RAM and 64 GB memory. it is adequate but not fast. The sound diaappeared a number of times when I left it for a while and I had to reboot from the very start to regain the sound. It freezed up on me a number of times for no reason and needed to be rebooted again as well. This is probably Acer's software incompatibility with Window 8. There is no stylus that comes with it and the after market stylus that you can buy from Fry's or Best Buy, has a little round plastic disc at the nib and got lost rather easily.  The touch screen is very responsive and has no problem but would not respond to my stylus from Toshiba. Window 8 on this device takes some getting used to. The construction is good because the back is not smooth and easy to hold. The keyboard has 2 strips of rubber to prevent it from sliding around. Once closed, you have to slip your finger nail in the front groove to open it. I find that rather clumsy. At $700, it is a great unit but I would like to see a stylus and 4G RAM configuration.",

            "input": "I so wanted to like (and KEEP) this Anker Bluetooth Folio Keyboard Case for iPad Air.  I have tried several other models and makes and so far, this model is close to being very good but it fails in many crucial areas.  The good, as others have stated is the feeling of the keypad.  Key travel and tactile feel is nice.  Solid feel of the case and keyboard overall is also a plus.  The material that the case and keyboard are made of is pleasant and grippey (not slippery) so you can carry it confidently without fear of it sliding out of your hands.  The magnet that holds the iPad in place for typing and activates the keyboard is solid and gives a comforting &#34;click&#34; sound letting you know it's in place. This is one of the best features of the case - the magnetic activation of the keyboard (like it's completing a circuit) and is a feature that ALL manufacturers should implement in their cases. Now the negatives:  1) only 1 viewing angle.  Limits the positions that you can optimally view the screen.  Not a great angle for viewing on your lap as the angle is somewhat close to vertical.  2) The pairing can be inconsistent. I've had to repair the keyboard a few times and I've only had it a few days so far. 3) The annoying clip that holds the iPad in place which you need to UNCLIP each time you want to go to typing mode. Why couldn't they have just used a magnet of some sort to lightly keep the iPad in place instead of a clip?  4) My biggest complaint/dissatisfaction with the case however is the lack of any sort of way to keep the case fully closed. There are magnets in the keyboard base below the space bar however they aren't sufficiently strong enough to keep the case closed. Additional magnets should have been designed into the unit on the portion of the case that connects to the iPad itself so that when it's in the closed position, the dual magnets connect. This issue has been addressed it seems in the later version of this case designed for the Air 2.  That version has the additional magnets that actually &#34;snap&#34; the case closed and keep it closed so that your iPad is not waking and draining the battery while you're not using it.  Having had the opportunity to use and compare both versions of this case, I can unequivocally say that the Air 2 version is far superior to the Air (1) version.  Clearly the designers of this case saw this particular flaw with the Air 1 and then made this improvement resulting int the Air 2 version. Too bad for all of us Air 1 users though as we're still stuck with a case with a major flaw which is a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />If the people at ANKER are truly reading these reviews, then it would be great if they could take these complaints into consideration and make the changes mentioned (all of these have been previously covered by other reviewers).<br /><br />Unfortunately, this one is a big miss and I will be looking for a replacement.has the additional magnets that actually &#34;snap&#34; the case closed and keep it closed so that your iPad is not waking and draining the battery while you're not using it.

That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, the *only* manufacturer of 1TB USB flash drives is Kingston with their DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for \\\\\"DTHXP30 review\\\\\" to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 1TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive.

The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.

Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

The product is designed to fit perfectly over the model that you have so be doubly-sure that you buy the correct size ClearTouch Protector meant for your GARMIN NUVI GPS model. If it's for the Nuvi 200-series, make sure it's for the Wide Screen if you have a GARMIN NUVI wide-screen model (for this review the Garmin NUVI 260W Widescreen GPS).    My only complaint is that this ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector works too well in that it can attract airborne dust. But the screen protector is removable, washable and reuseable so it's just a matter of doing these things if things get too dirty and dusty.    You see, the problem isn't the dust on top as much as the tiny particles of dust that get trapped between the ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector and the surface of the GPS screen itself (this can result in air-bubbles or dust-bubbles).     However, it's not a major problem and won't cause any distortion of the screenview. Nontheless, if you know someone with long, beautiful, lucious (and dangerous) fingernails, a ClearTouch Screen Protector will protect your GARMIN NUVI 260W Widescreen GPS!",

I also own the Magic Trackpad for my iMac which feels laser precise and you can just tell that it's very well engineered when you feel and use it. I'm also a huge fan of logitech products and I purchased this to compliment my bluetooth easy switch keyboard and see well it fares. So here are some of the pro's and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />It's rechargeable and not even noticeable when you charge it because you don't slide the trackpad around like a mouse<br /><br />- When you install the software it adds a nice bonus gesture where you can double tap and drag to move windows<br /><br />-  It's perfectly level with logitech's bluetooth easy switch keyboard (just like how the magic trackpad lines up with their wireless keyboard)<br /><br />- The build of the device is really solid<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- The  tracking is pretty good, but not flawless like the Magic Trackpad. It's still better than any Pc trackpad I've used but I was expecting this to be just as good as Apple's.<br /><br />- The clicking doesn't really click in as much as the Magic Trackpad. If you tap to click then of course this will be a non issue but it doesn't feel as satisfying when you click on it. It almost feels like half a click.<br /><br />For the same price I would just stick with the Magic Trackpad and buy a cheap pack of AA's here and just replace them every 2.5 - 3 months. If the tracking was just as smooth as the Magic Trackpad then this would be a no brainer.",

The 150 watt subwoofer is exceptional and will completely blow your mind if not your windows. There was no disappointment there.  <BR>       <BR>Okay, onto the bad.  The two satellite speakers hissed which became very annoying. You could hear it a good 10 feet away even with music playing loudly. The highs were extremely piercing and hard on the ears even with the treble turned all the way down. My next major complaint is that it didn't treat all styles of music equally. I listen to a variety of music and believe me I tried em all. It distorted fairly easy on music styles with a lot of highs such classical music and movie soundtracks. If you're a piano fan....forget it, piano sounds terrible on this system. It sounds like a cheap electronic keyboard with the volume turned all the way up. Okay, maybe not that bad but you get the idea. My final complaint is the placement of the treble and bass controls on the subwoofer. It is very inconvenient to reach under your desk to get at them. <BR>      <BR>Anyhow, I returned the megaworks and went out and bought the Creative T5400 5.1 system for $100 at Comp USA(I might be wrong but I believe the cambridge megaworks was co-designed by creative). While it doesn't have the power of the megaworks there is no speaker hiss, All music styles sound good, it works equally well with games and movies, and its very comfortable to listen too even at higher volumes. The subwoofer isn't as impressive but it does just fine and compliments the speakers very well. The T5400 also has tweeters on the 3 front speakers, a very nice feature. <BR>     <BR>Frankly I would suggest you get a 5.1 system because there isn't a 2.1 system out there that really sounds good and you can get them for about the same price or a little more. I was concerned about space as you might be but its worth itand you'll find the space. The creative system I bought is easy to mount on the wall. Cambridge just discontinued their only good 5.1 PC system which is to bad. My brother has it and it is a very, very good system. Why do they do that? They have something good and they get rid of it. Anyhow good luck! Checkout the creative systems you won't be disappointed.",

This unit, the smallest size WD makes in a portable drive, will easily hold the entire contents of my computer, making it an excellent back-up drive. The unit comes pre-loaded with backup software, one for desktop use, the other for backing up to the Cloud; it also comes with WD's drive utilities for maintenance work. Setup is ridiculously simple, just plug it into a USB 3.0 port and its ready to go. For the price, much less than an internal drive placed into an enclosure, you can't go wrong. Add in the 3 year warranty and my reasons for a 5-star rating are obvious.<br /><br />An Unfortunate Update:  Shortly after I started using the drive to backup around 30 GB worth of data (not images), my hard drive monitoring program flashed a warning that the drive was running hot, which indeed it was. The max temp the software recorded was 42\u00b0 C, the maximum operating temp specified for the drive is 35\u00b0 C, meaning my drive was operating at 7\u00b0 C over the maximum allowed for the drive. I contacted tech support and they immediately offered to replace the drive. And while I'm doing it this way ONCE, even a 3 year warranty can't make up for a device that fails right out of the box! Whatever happened to Quality Control?<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE:  WD replaced my brand new, never used drive and its 3 YEAR warranty with a refurbished drive with a 4 MONTH warranty. Used for brand new? This is the last WD product I purchase.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Former WD Customer",

Fire up my laptop then my Cintiq screen, all in all the process took 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />I finally realized this product is meant to be tethered to a desktop  and not really for someone who wants to say use it in the living room or on the go.<br /><br />Ultimately, it proved too cumbersome for me and I returned it and will be looking into the Cintiq companion. This is a great machine, the construction, design and feel is excellent. But be mindful of the capacity in which your going to work on it. I'm not a professional but I'm good enough where a Cintiq screen is optimal for me.

For listening to videos/lectures on my PC which may sometimes be mixed at a low volume these speakers only just barely pump out enough volume at max level. For normal use they would be loud enough, but in some situations you may face audio or movies which are mixed with low volume or a volume that drops off where these speakers don't quite pump out enough volume.

I used this combo to control my home theater PC, so I placed the receiving base by the computer about 5 feet away from where I sit. Everytime I needed to reset it, that involved playing with cabling to pull the receiving base out to a position where I can hit the &quot;reset&quot; button. Anyone who has an intricate wiring setup for their PC/Stereo/TV can appreciate that this is a hassle. Eventually, I grew bored of playing this game and stretched the receiving base out to the coffee table. Sure, there was an ugly cord stretched out in the middle of the room, but I was sick of having to dig it out. <br />Another problem with the mouse is that it seems to go to &quot;sleep&quot; after 20 minutes of inactivity. Which means moving it does nothing. You have to click a button to wake it up. I've had a screensaver running and having to click a button to wake up the mouse has ended up sending that mouse click to an application running under the screensaver. I try to use the keyboard to turn off the screensaver before waking the mouse.<br />If that wasn't annoying enough, the mouse NEVER EVER worked! It was flaky. I'd right click on the desktop, not move the mouse at all, and by the time the menu popped up, I was unable to move the mouse pointer. Distance from the RF base had nothing to do with this, as I was able to duplicate this 1&quot; away from the base. In the middle of a mouse operation, the mouse would stop working. This happens every time I use it. Imagine the frustration of trying to control a DVD app, hitting the seek button, then having the mouse stop working when you need to hit play again. I have never owned such a difficult to use mouse, wireless or otherwise. I eventually lost my temper with it one day and through it down the stairs. Remarkably, this seemed to fix it, although temporarily.<br />I have since paid upfor the Gyration wireless combo and am happy I did. The keyboard may find another use in my house, but I cannot get the mouse out of my sight quick enough. Basically, if having a mouse is important to you, walk away from this combo.",

However, ever since I got it, I've had an issue with the USB cable. At the slightest movement, whether it's the harddrive being shifted or something bumping against any part of the cable, it automatically disconnects. Even if I was using a desktop computer I would be concerned about it disconnecting because I'm constantly shifting things on my desk and plugging and unplugging things from my computer - tablets and mice and keyboards and USBs and chargers, etc. etc. I'm worried that if this continues to happen the drive itself will corrupt and I'll lose all my data.<br /><br />I'm considering buying a Thunderbolt adapter for it since that might be a more reliable port but at this point the adapter is more expensive than a new harddrive so I might as well get a new one.

Nice but not enough to outweigh other differences.<br />* Looks (color & texture): I ordered both cases in Magenta but they looked quite different. The Blade's texture was more subtle and the color was pinker. The Smartshell cover was a little thicker, more deeply textured, and the color had some orange undertones. Both cases were nice colors but were a little lighter in color than what I expected for &#34;Magenta.&#34;<br />* Top cover: At the edges, the Blade top cover is compressed and very thin and stiff. As a result, when it was folded around back for reading, the cover felt as if it were cutting into the softest part of my hand. This is the primary reason I returned the Blade cover.<br />* Back: on the SmartShell, the textured cover goes all the way to the edges (or almost; there is a thin line of black plastic around the edges). It looks nice. On the Blade, in contrast, the textured cover stops short, leaving a wide black plastic margin around three sides of the Kindle (the fourth side folds over to cover the top of the Kindle).  On the back, it looks like a thick black reverse C surrounding some textured cover. It looked ugly and cheap to me, certainly not what I expected of the Blade given that it is advertised as Fintie's &#34;premium&#34; case.<br />The magnetic latch works nicely on both covers and I don't mind the &#34;bump&#34; for the SmartShell case.

In that respect, I really like the Logitech \\\\\"Unifying receiver\\\\\" concept because it allows you to mix-and-match a variety of keyboard and mouse combos to suit your preferences.  This mouse does indeed work on my couch and couch-like surfaces, which my previous Microsoft mouse could not.  It's a neat trick, but not really one that is a big sell on me.  The performance on couch surfaces is slightly off, so if you're doing precise work, you'll want to stick with a desk.  There are quite a few negatives to this mouse as well.  Size wise, it runs small.  And I have small hands, so I imagine it may not be comfortable for someone with normal sized hands.  Auto-off is a failed experiment.  The mouse is designed to turn off whenever it isn't making contact with your hands.  As a result, there's an ever-so-slight delay when you go from typing with both hands to using your mouse.  Also, I find that my grip on the mouse causes it to lose connectivity and turn off intermittently, which causes a frustrating staggering effect with your mouse pointer.  As a result, I make a very concerted effort to keep the palm of my hand in contact with the mouse at all times.  Connectivity is iffy, but I'm can't really say if it's 1) an issue with this mouse, 2) an issue with signal interference in my house/environment, or 3) an issue related to the auto-off feature described above.  The end result is that the mouse is usable, but somewhat inaccurate.  Due to connectivity issues, I occasionally click the wrong link or the wrong part of my screen.  Lastly, I do not like the scroll wheel.  My preference is for the clicking scroll wheels because I find them to be accurate.  What is nice is that this mouse has an option between smooth scrolling and click scrolling, which you can toggle by clicking in on the mouse wheel.  This is a rather poordesign choice because clicking in on the mouse wheel also functions as a button.  What happens if I want to use that button, but don't want to toggle my mouse wheel setting from click to smooth or vice versa?  Furthermore, I don't like the scroll wheel effect in either setting.  The smooth scrolling is intolerable in some applications.  It is so sensitive that an application will detect scrolling even when you're not scrolling and you're just moving your mouse around.  It also suffers from bounce-back scrolling, which is when you scroll in one direction but when you stop, it detects a bit of scrolling in the opposite direction.  For example, say you're using the mouse wheel to zoom in on a map on Google Maps.  When you're done zooming in, it often zooms out a little bit at the end, which is incredibly frustrating.  The click scroll setting is also flawed, because it's still so sensitive that it detects a bit of scrolling in between clicks on the wheel.  All-in-all, I would not recommend this mouse.  However, as a cheaply priced mouse (at least it was when I bought it, $17), it is serviceable.  Which is why I gave it 2/5.",

I was continually shutting the machine down until I reconfigured the system so that the power button \\\\\"does nothing\\\\\".  The power button still turns the machine on and will turn it off if you hold it (for an emergency shutoff) but this prevents the accidental shutdowns.  The second quirk is trying to upgrade the memory.  You can go to 2GB (from the original 1GB) and the memory is super easy to remove and replace.  But what kind of memory works seems to be one of the best kept secrets of the universe!  The users manual says it takes DDR2 memory -- WRONG!  Obviously an outdated users manual.  It takes DDR3.  After two unsuccessful attempts, I called Lenovo Tech Support.  Although they originally said you couldn't upgrade the memory, when pressed, they finally came back with a list of two (only two) models of memory that were guaranteed to work.  One was a Hynix and the other a Micron model.  I finally located the Micron model and it did work (although it appears to be the same specs as the Samsung one I tried that did not work).

Since the compartments contained DVRs and are closed during the day, I wanted to make sure temperatures stayed reasonable. I ran the five temperature leads to the five separate compartments, plumbed through the MDF walls of the enclosure along with the fan power/control wires.<br /><br />I like how the five independent fan controls display motion if the fan is running, and the ability to manually control five fans independently is pretty helpful as well. Overall the NZXT Sentry LX looks pretty in operation, but I've found the temperature readings are wildly inaccurate and tend to stay close to one another regardless of the surroundings. To test this I tried putting a heat rock in one compartment and an ice pack in another. Both temperature readings stayed between 72-76 degrees F. I put my oven thermometer in the heat rock compartment and saw 85 degrees. My house thermometer read 65 in the ice compress compartment. The sentry temperature readings never left the mid 70s.<br /><br />In manual mode I've found the unit does not always like to accept my inputs. Fans will turn on at max speed in manual mode, when I adjust down from 2200 rpm to 800, the screen changes to reflect the numbers change but the fans do not slow down. The screen itself looks nice but viewing angles are very shallow. Your eyes must be level & head-on with the screen for the digits to be viewable. If you plan on having this on a floor PC or somewhere other than directly in front of you, you won't be able to make out the numbers while it is in operation.<br /><br />The last thing that irritates me is the wild price fluctuations I see for this in just the last two months (as of December 2014). Another Amazon user claims to have purchased it for $28 about eight months ago. I paid $45. Today I see it listed at $60. Different vendors are charging wildly different prices for the exact same item. If you want it, do some research on pricing. You should not pay more than $50 based on average pricing history for the NZXT Sentry LX.<br /><br />if I was going to do this again, I would instead purchase the Phobya fan splitter (they make 3-pin and 4-pin versions, fed by your 4-wire molex plug).

            "input": "I purchased this monitor upgrading from an old CRT (18 inch Trinitron from Dell). Because I was going from CRT to LCD and from 4:3 to 16:9, there were a lot of new variables to consider in order to ensure I got a monitor that satisfied me. I studied the specs on a number of monitors in the $200 range, considering models from $180 up  to about $250 and more. I got this model because it looked like a steal. The specs were all there: 2 ms response time, 23 inches of screen real estate, full HD, high contrast ration, you name it. It also got decent reviews online.     The trouble is that whenever you buy an item like this entirely online, you are buying based on numbers, word of mouth, and other ultimately unreliable sources of information. You should know upfront that manufacturers use different ways of computing these metrics. For example, you can't compare contrast rations between manufacturers reliably. Such a comparison MIGHT be an indication of a real difference in quality, or it might be meaningless. It's impossible to know. In fact, you can't even compare contrast ratios between models made by the SAME manufacturer from different years! Even if it's the same MODEL! This leaves us consumers in a real pinch. Especially when buying ONLINE.    When I got my monitor, I was initially very impressed with the size of the screen. The 16:9 format is really so much better. It's great for movies and it's even better for the extra desktop space. Teamed with Windows 7's nifty windows that snap to the sides of the screen, comparing two browsers or documents is really nice. The vertical height of this screen is about the same as a 19 inch 4:3 monitor. I have to say, I somehow thought this would be bigger, but it seems bigger than it is due to the extra horizontal space. Running in full 1080p is nice, too. The resolution is crisp and beautiful. Colors are fairly good and overall picture quality is good, though not stellar. After testing the monitor on monitor testing sites, I'mnot entirely sure how much of a difference the advertised 2ms response time makes. This is another instance where that number may or may not mean much, and testing the monitor is difficult without something to compare it to.     But all this is knit-picking. I would be more than happy with this purchase except for one characteristic that just leaves me anxious over whether or not I should return it and try a different model out: VIEWING ANGLE. This model has a very poor viewing angle. Granted, I am coming from a CRT where viewing angle was not really an issue. But looking at the monitor from even just a slightly up or down angle makes a huge difference in contrast, and the horizontal angle seems equally poor. It's not atrociously poor, but poor enough to make me wonder whether or not I can live with it. It is definitely NOT acceptable considering the ADVERTISED viewing angle is 160 degrees v/h (who knows how they came up with that number, but I consider it false advertising). I should also mention that I am writing this review from work on a Samsung SyncMaster 943ewx, and this monitor has a great viewing angle, almost as good as a CRT, so I do have some kind of point of reference. The viewing angle is also worse than any of the three laptops in my home, one of which is around 8 years old! To compound this drawback, the monitor stand does not allow for up and down movement. To adjust it to eye level you will need to put it on a phone book or something. Very unfortunate that one major kink should stand in my way of feeling like I made a smart buy.    I highly recommend you go into a store and look at monitors up close before buying. If you cannot do this, then buy two or more models, try them out side by side, keep the one you like the most and return the others. You will be out the return shipping, sure, but it beats having to buy one monitor individually and wonder whether or not it's a good buy and possibly having to pay for return shipping anyway if you're unhappy. At least this way you know you have the monitor you want. Also, this is the only real way to compare monitors, because the controlled conditions of a store don't really allow you to test and compare monitors, nor spend any real time with them doing your daily tasks.    Overall, this is a good value model, especially for this screen size, but it does sacrifice in at least one critical area.",

I get 2 to 4 calls about 3-5 days a week.  I have reported these calls to Skype and they have no solution.  It has been goiung on for months.  Here is a couple of reports I sent to Skype:  7/1/12  This is the e 3rd time I have contacted Skype on this problem. I have been receiving calls from System Repair, sometimes as much as 4 times a day, a call in the morning followed by a repeat call 10 minutes later. The other day, I received all at midnight and another call 10 minutes later.  I have been told my computer need fixing & to go to [...] plus other sites I have previously sent (I have detailed feedback messages also). TODAY, I RECIEVED A CALL AND BY RIGHT CLICKING on it & viewing the contact information, I got a source address which was w7vis.ms. I am hoping this information will help you. A lot of the time, I do not get these calls on my computer but on my Free Talk phone. Is there a way that I can block these internet calls or program it to only let phone calls from phones & not internet addresses to call me? I would like some feedback on this problem & will work with you in any way to stop these calls. I am sure that I am not the only one with a Free Talk phone getting these calls. I did not pay $59.99 for the phone & another $60 for the number to get malicious calls at all times of the day.  Thank you,  Michael Hays    9/5/2012  I have started receiving system repair calls again. I have received 17 calls that I have blocked on my computer but they keep calling on my phone I have connected to my FreeTalk adapter.  How can I block calls on my FreeTalk adapter?  The following pictures are screen shots of the profile of these calls.  I will try and attach a MP3 file recording these calls.  They call at all times of the day 2 times in ten minutes and as I stated, \u00bd of the time bi-passing my computer.    10/23/2012  I did aIP address lookup on one of the address' given to go to and discovered that these address' belong to a domain named \\\\\"repair.se\\\\\" with an address range of 194.9.94.86 and 194.9.94.85 located in Sweden and with DNS servers of ns1.loopia.se 194.9.94.240, ns2.loopia.se and ns2.loopia.se.  The Organization is Loopia AB, the ISP is Loopa AB.  Skype headquarters is located in Luxemburg but has an office in Stockholm Sweden.  If you do a Google search for Skype locations, you can find this out and if you click on Sweden you come up with the following information:    Karsten Vandborg Sorenson    I work as a senior research and development engineer in the audio team.

            "input": "Pros:<br /><br />Shape- For small to medium sized hands that like to use the claw grip, the MiCO is an absolute joy to hold.  I have been through quite a few gaming mice (Deathadder, G400, CM Storm Spawn), and the simple shape of the MiCO allows me to game for hours without any soreness in my hand.  While my hands were big enough to use the three previously mentioned mice, my fingers never rested comfortably in their curves as intended.  The MiCO on the other hand allows me to claw it any way I want to.<br /><br />Size- If you have big hands or like to palm your mice, the MiCO is probably not for you.  If you like to use a claw or fingertip grip, this mouse should be the perfect size.<br /><br />Teflon feet and weight-  The light weight combined with the teflon feet makes the MiCO glide really smooth and fast across my cloth mouse pad (Steelseries Qck+).  The weight of the mouse also makes it really easy to lift off.<br /><br />Overall Build Quality- This mouse feels very solid despite its somewhat cheap look.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Scroll Wheel Issues- The first batch of MiCO's that were released suffered from squeaky scroll wheels that would eventually break.  While the problem has been fixed, you may be unlucky like me and get one of those first models.  For me, the scroll wheel would make a really loud screech every time I scrolled up.  However, after I RMA'd my faulty MiCO, the mouse wheel still makes quite an audible squeak every now and then, but its alot more bearable than before.<br /><br />Scroll Wheel Quality- The scroll wheel just doesn't feel good to use at all.  The steps are not well defined compared to other gaming mice and clicking the wheel makes it feel really flimsy.  If using the wheel is necessary to your game, you will want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Quality Control Issues- I am actually on my third MiCO.  As mentioned before, the first MiCO had the faulty scroll wheel.  I RMA'd it, shipped it to Zowie (had to pay for shipping), and received my second MiCO.  However, after about 2-3 months, the cursor would just freeze every couple of minutes and the light on the scroll wheel would flicker.  After complaining to Zowie, they decided to ship me a new one free of charge.  This may not happen to everyone, but seeing as it happened to me, I thought it should be mentioned.  (FYI: RMA process for me took about 1-2 weeks total)<br /><br />Sensor- I have read from other reviews that the MiCO has some problems tracking at 1600 dpi.  The 400 and 800 dpi settings are fine.  I tend to use the 800 dpi setting and have had no problems thus far.  So, if you are looking at this mouse for the 1600 dpi setting, you may want to reconsider.  (Disclaimer: I have not actually performed the technical tests on this mouse, so if you want more information in this area look to other reviews)<br /><br />Neutral/Personal Opinions:<br /><br />Cord- The thickness of the cord is average.  Its not super stiff, thick, and braided, but its not as thin and flexible as I would like it to be.  However, because the MiCO is really small and light, the average cord width and flexibility makes any drag or contact of the cord really noticeable.  This can be solved by making enough space on your desk for the cord.<br /><br />Huano Switches- Most other mice use Omron switches which are a lot softer and easier to press than the Huano switches found in Zowie mice.  Some people love them because they provide a pretty satisfying noise along with a nice tactile feel.  They also ensure that you will almost never unintentionally click either of the buttons (a problem I had with the Spawn).  Other people hate them because they require more force to press.  While it may not be that noticeable with one or two presses, it may be unbearable in games like SC2 or Diablo 3 that require a lot of clicking and could possibly lower your APM or cause discomfort.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I personally like this mouse, and in my opinion the pros barely outweigh the cons.  I would rate this mouse a 3/5 (taking off 1 star for the faulty mice and 1 star for the iffy scroll wheel).  However, despite how comfortable it is, I would not recommend this mouse to others.  The MiCO ended up costing me more time and money than I thought it would, and it is simply not worth all that trouble.",

Kids tend to like Android because of the game APPS. One issue I have had is with the sound. Sometimes it works with certain APPS, sometimes it doesn't, and I have to reboot the tablet. A second issue I have is sometimes the tablet freezes. Because updates are installed in the background, the tablet freezes, and I have to reboot. After rebooting, the updates install and it acts normally again. This doesn't happen too often, but it's still a little annoying. Finally, the keyboard I purchased with the tablet causes it to freeze up from time to time, and again, I just do a reboot.<br /><br />I now try to make sure I just shut down the tablet entirely when I'm done with it.

I got a dual-USB car adapter and two of these cables--one for my AT&T Samsung Galaxy S2 and one for my wife's AT&T Samsung Infuse 4G.<br /><br />My phone (the S2) has an Otterbox case (Commuter series, SKU: 77-18649), where the cut-out for the USB is reasonably small around the USB port itself. The problem I encountered is that the Micro-B plug on this coiled cable is so thick that it doesn't click into my phone's USB port. Yes, it makes contact but it can easily come off by the slightest movement. I don't understand why they had to make it so thick. Is it to make it more durable or something? The plug on my previous Samsung car charger is thinner and it clicks and hangs on just fine for many, many hours.<br /><br />One day I was on a 3-hour drive, with GPS turned on, using this Mediabridge cable and it got disconnected due to vibration/movement of the car. Of course, how can I reconnect it without stopping at a rest area? Very annoying.<br /><br />On the other hand, my wife's phone's case's (Case Mate's) cut-out is a bit bigger so I don't think she has an issue with this cable.<br /><br />When you get this item, just make sure to test it out with your phone, if it has a case, and make sure it easily clicks and stays connected reliably.",

            "input": "I received my Aspire 5520-5908 on 1/29/08 and overall I am fairly happy with the product so-far.    A few things to note with it right-away. It lacks RAM which should be upgraded because doing so makes this laptop run almost twice as fast. I upgraded the RAM to a total of 4GB, which cost me an additional $90.00. I decided on a RAM upgrade after only 20 minutes of having the laptop in my hands. I also un-installed the default installation of Vista Home Premium by repartitioning and formatting the hard drive. After re-installing Windows 64-bit Vista Business Edition, I then used the drivers available from Acer.Com's support section to get things \\\\\"up and running.\\\\\"    Adding the RAM and installing a fresh operating system allowed this computer to run at its full-potential while also freeing up enormous amounts of disk space. I can't suggest-enough to anyone buying this laptop to add RAM to it. This laptop will only run to about 1/3 of its potential speed capabilities, simply because the system itself is a memory-hog by design. The integrated video card, as an example uses a portion of the system RAM. This means that by default, the 1GB of system RAM gives 768MB of RAM to the system, and the other 256MB of RAM is given to the video card. One \\\\\"good\\\\\" thing about this arrangement is that after installing additional RAM, you can actually give this video card another 128MB of RAM if you so wish. 384MB for a video card is actually pretty-good, and is so-needed in Vista because of the Aero interface. the video card, for those wondering is NVIDIA's 7000M, which is reputed to be a fairly-weak video card, even for laptops. I don't see that as much of a problem as some would. For those playing cutting-edge video games and or D/V editing software, that may be an issue. For the average user though, this card is actually a lot more than sufficient.    Here are the problems that exist...  Despite my best-efforts to find a suitable driver that would work, I still could not get the TouchPad working nicely on this Laptop. The TouchPad seems to be a sore-spot with all owners of Laptops in this series from Acer. I should mention that this problem existed when the Laptop was running under its default installation, and didn't become any worse under the new installation. Unfortunately, it certainly didn't get any better. In fact, I'm not sure a driver is the issue here, as many people on various technical forums discussing this issue have said that this is a hardware issue and that software (like a driver) isn't going to have any impact on it.    The specific problem with the TouchPad seems revolve around its sensitivity and its periodic insensitivity. At times the TouchPad will hang, and this was one of my main motivators in acquiring additional RAM. After a hang, it seems to become \\\\\"confused,\\\\\" and any additional attempts to move the pointer on-screen are met with what appears to be a fristrated Touchpad. Sometimes the pointer will not move at all, other times it will actually move a portion of the way, and then move backwards and away from your intended target.    Probably the most-annoying aspect of all this is when the Touchpad buttons seem to be possessed by a three year-old pianist with too-much energy. If one has any screens of importance open when this happens, this becomes an impending-disaster. Because the pointer will begin to move on its own in-tandem with the buttons which seem to be furiously \\\\\"clicking-away\\\\\" will do things like close the application you're working with, fill in each and every checkbox in-sight, and cause general mayhem to your work. For a demonstration without having to buy this model, hand your current laptop to any child under age four, and ask them to type you a document as quickly as possible. The results would be similar I'm sure.    THE included RAM, as I stated is woefully inadequate. Until this was upgraded, I don't think I've run-across a laptop that ran so painfully-slow.    The pre-installed software is more nuisance than benefit to anyone with serious work to accomplish. It should be noted that this is a very multimedia-focused laptop, and the included software is geared in that direction. For those who wish to *watch* (not edit) video, listen to music, or surf the web, I'm sure this laptop in its default-state would be great for that. The included version of MS Office is a 60-day trial, and unless that's something you plan on paying for (or already have a license for) should be un-installed. The running services that MS Office employs will be needlessly taking up processing power once this trial times out.    Despite those issues, I fully-recommend this laptop. At the price it's currently being sold at, this laptop is more than worth the money. With the few upgrades it needs to run at its full potential, and with a bit of work playing with the software, it becomes a reliable and powerful machine.",

The problem is that the interface was confusing and clunky, and it was just as slow as the Nook.  I will say that, for the size, it's fairly light weight, but it does feel a bit heavier than I hoped, especially when you put it against my nephew's Kindle Fire Deluxe (the big one).

Without the cover, I can slip the kindle into my front pocket pretty easily.  It's a real struggle to do so with the cover on<br /><br />2) There's not really a comfortable position to hold the kindle in when the cover is attached.  The bit that covers the screen is either flopping around, or it's wrapped around the back and getting in the way of holding it comfortably in one hand.<br /><br />3) It feels really cheap. It's supposedly made out of leather, but the texture and pattern on the outside doesn't resemble any leather I've seen before.  It's much more the texture of a plastic dashboard in a low-end econobox car.<br /><br />4) Given all 3 of the above, it's really overpriced.  I purchased a far-superior case for my iPad a few months back (real leather, etc.) for $20.  Because of that, I think $15 or so would be a much more fair price for this cover.<br /><br />On the upside, it does seem like this cover would do a good job of protecting the Kindle from drops and scuffs. I don't need that level of protection (mine rarely leaves my bedside, except when I'm traveling), but that might be important for some folks who take it out and about more than I do.<br /><br />Still, all in all, I've decided to return mine in the next few days, and look for a cover that's less bulky and cheap-feeling.

I still prefer the iogear that I purchased, but it restored a little faith in HP.<br /><br />After seeing the great reviews for the previous version, I was excited to see that a new 3d compatible and better looking version was coming out.  So I had Amazon over night it the second it came in stock.  Got it the next day, hooked it up to my media center and projector....and nothing.  Receiver seemed to work fine and would display \\\\\"linking\\\\\" on the screen, but the transmitter just sat there doing nothing.  I tried it on my Xbox 360, computer, av receiver.  The transmitter did nothing plugged into any of them.  In frustration I tried jamming the power plug into the transmitter, and low and behold there was blinking for a few seconds.  That was it though, and it never connected in those short brief glorious seconds.<br /><br />So I figured I must have just gotten a dud, and ordered a replacement through Amazon's magnificent returns system.  New one arrived the following day.  Just plugged it in...and nothing.  Tried all my devices once again, and same result.  Now at this point I should probably tell you that I have studied Electrical Engineering, have numerous certifications in a multitude of different areas, and I am a IT Administrator that lives by my gadget lust.  So when I call tech support on a product, I assure you it is not because I forgot to plug something in or haven't tried rebooting it.  At this point, the transmitter doesn't blink to show its searching for the receiver, and the only device that even registers that something is plugged into the hdmi port is my hdmi splitter which just shows that there is a signal coming in and a device connected to the output that has a voltage coming through it.  Anyway, none of that information really matters, because no one at HP has heard of the device.  I read about that in the other thread on the previous version, but thought I'd give it a shot anyway.  Sure enough, after no less than 7 transfers and an hour on the phone, the only think that resulted was me teaching 7 different people about this great new device they have.<br /><br />If you've made it this far in the review, the obvious conclusion is to stay away.  Hopefully its just a bad batch or needed update, but after dealing with the HP non support, I will try someone else.  Sadly nothing else out there looks good, and support doesn't seem that great for other competing products.  I guess its time to do some more shopping, and starting contemplating the horrible thought of having to run a hdmi cable.",

In the same way, Windows 7 which will come out in a few months is said to be a hugely cleaned up version of Vista.<br /><br />So I guess I will either wait a couple of months for Windows 7 equipped versions of netbooks to come out, or get one from another company.

The board booted, I OCed my 3770k 4.2 GHz and still had more room to overclock.<br /><br />My issue was simply that my mouse did not work most of the time. In the UEFI BIOS, Linux and Windows, the mouse does not work until I disconnect and reconnect it. On the Hard Forums, an ASUS representative said a patch for UEFI could take weeks or more, and that the issue with Windows may be fixed as a result, or may require a driver fix.<br /><br />I've since switched to the MSI GD65 board, and everything works fine. (and this mouse worked fine on two x58 boards, and an asus P68 motherboard.)<br /><br />For the record, I have two mice, the Mionix Naos 5000 didn't fix it. The Sidewinder X8 did. I like my Naos 5000 enough to have switched my board.<br /><br />Additionally, even when the mouse is recognized, all mice suffer a delay on boot before they work. This also disappeared with the change to e GD65.<br /><br />Finally, I never got the wifi AP to work. It worked OK as a client, and I was able to connect to my router with a rate of 150M. In AP mode however, I never was able to get a single device to to even see the network I had created. It's probably a software issue that ASUS will fix, but I remember similar issues with an old ASUS board (a socket 939 board) that had the ability to be an AP that also had awful software.<br /><br />As far as the UEFI bios goes, it was OK. I immediately disabled the non-advanced UI to get overclock manually, and the advanced UI's layout was OK, and I saw no issues setting boot devices, setting my overlock and such. I will note that if you plan to overclock manually, you need to make sure you also adjust the voltage manually. With the voltage set to auto and the CPU at 4.2 turbo, my voltage would go upwards of 2.25V. Once set manually, my chip was stable (and cooler) at a lower voltage.<br /><br />Lastly, resuming from suspend never worked. Everything would power back up, but video output wouldnever happen. I would have to manually reset the system (verified this occurred with no overclock.) again, my GD65 has no issues here.<br /><br />All in all, I wasn't impressed. But I think my issues can all be resolved with updated firmware. In the mean time, my GD65 is a stable performer out of the box, and the only thing I lost was Wifi (and gained some PCIe lanes.)",

The metal that surrounds them is split underneath by design and it came apart when I plugged a cable into the ports.  Happened on both sides, though I was very careful second time I plugged a cable into a port.  The frame of the adapter is not very rigid either, so you can expect to use this in a bay that uses pressure to hold it in - it will just buckle.<br /><br />So, this may be worth the price, but I'd look for more value.

I've tried several cables and slot configurations with the same sporadic results Sometimes it boots. Sometimes it doesn't. I have to jiggle the cable. It's not the end of the world because I bought a separate SSD for my system drive. The 2tb is just storage, with another external backup.<br /><br />The really bad: For the first couple of months I was getting severe lag spikes while doing just about anything. I tried to diagnose the problem and wasn't having any luck until one day I listened closely to the case and heard the LG BluRay drive repeating a read action and then stopping over and over again. I decided to try unplugging it from the motherboard and sure enough that was the culprit. needless to say I'm not happy about it but I don't own or rent BluRay disks (or any others for that matter) so it's not a big issue for me. I haven't really missed it. However for others that's a deal breaker and I certainly feel irked that it's a feature I paid for that I can't use.<br /><br />The good: It runs Photoshop CS6 Flawlessly and games like Skyrim, BF3, and Planetside2 maxed out in graphics. I'm running a 2560x1440px monitor and I have all 3 of those games running in native resolution beautifully. It's only crashed a couple of times in the now 6+ months I've owned it. I REALLY like Corsair the case it comes in. It's all metal with a built in handle in the top with LOTS of room for expansion and fans with easy to remove side panels. I now have 7 fans in this thing with it overclocked to the max and it stays nice and cool all the time.<br /><br />That said, I would not buy this computer again. I like tinkering with my PC but only when everything works. I think they have the foundation for a great product but their assemblage and choice of a sub-par Bluray player leaves much to be desired. This by all rights should be a fantastic computer and in many ways it is but it's not a company I'll likely do business with again unless I hear that they've improved their standards.

Unfortunately, the sb6121 would constantly reboot, even though the signal was within spec and had trouble maintaining the upstream channels for more than 10 hours at a time. Alas, the Zoom seems to be suffering the same issue. however, where the sb6121 would take upwards of 5 minutes to reacquire a channel, the 5341j takes about 30 seconds. I realize this is not really a fair comparison since the sb6121 is a 4/4 modem while the 5341j is an 8/4. The extra 4 downstream channels do help with downstream SNR however. Overall I am happy with the purchase.<br /><br />A couple annoyances I would like to point out, the SNMP Event Log is hidden; you have to manually enter http://192.168.100.1/RgEventLog.asp to see it; this is after you login for the first time. Also the event descriptions are truncated and the modem has a really short time-out, something like 1 minute of Idle page viewing before you have to re-enter the login details.<br /><br />Overall, if the sb6121 is giving you issues and your cable signal is within spec, I recommend you give this modem a try.",

The inner case is really sturdy, and though I haven't tried it out, I'm sure it would protect my Kindle from a waist-high fall to the carpet.  Maybe even a hard floor.  The inner case is incredibly sturdy -<br /><br />But, it's difficult.  The two pieces form a clam shell around the Kindle.  The piece you attach to the back side of your Kindle fits very tightly.  It isn't difficult to mount, but, if like me, you need to remove it to add a screen protector, be prepared to use a lot of finger pressure and a lot of patience.  It fits so tightly, it's as though it's a permanent container.<br /><br />You place your Kindle face down onto the other half of the case for storage.  This is a breeze, but you will need to zip the cover to ensure the Kindle doesn't slip out.  When using my Kindle, I find this other half of the case awkward.  My instincts tell me to unzip the cover, flip the Kindle face up, and let it rest in the piece of the case that is attached to the cover.  But the Kindle slips around on it, so generally I set the entire cover aside to keep my Kindle stationary.  This may be a mere personal peeve, because I'm accustomed to using folios.<br /><br />The inside of the cover is finished in felt/suede/whatever - it's soft but a lint magnet.  There are little pockets on the left inner side of the cover, and a pen loop in the center.  If you plan to keep a pen or stylus in the cover, make sure it's a skinny one, because when you zip the cover.  Oh, goodness, if you put a pen in it, the cover is so tight it's difficult to zip.<br /><br />It is a good zipper, by the way.  But altogether, I find this product fulfills two out of three \\\\\"Fs.\\\\\"  Great form and function.  The fit is too tight for my liking.  It is nice looking.  If you're on the fence, and I would be if I was considering purchasing this case, base your decision on whether you prefer style or fit.  If you want style, get it.

I don't tend to leave it in the case, because I'm afraid of it getting bumped (I have three small kids whose main goal in life is to steal my iPad), and so if I want to use it, that means I have to go find it, attach it, go into \\\\\"settings,\\\\\" turn on Bluetooth and pair the keyboard and the iPad.

I really did forget I was reading from an electronic device, and even pawed at imaginary pages to turn every now and then. Super easy on the eyes, and I really like the fact that it mirrors a paper reading experience - if the light is bad, the device does not compensate by way of a backlit screen.<br />- The Kindle store's shopping experience is very smooth, very transparent. I have bought a few books, a magazine, and currently on a couple of free trial magazine and blog subscriptions.  The latest editions of the New York Times and The Onion are waiting for me first thing in the morning, once you get the hang of how the \\\\\"Back\\\\\" button works (versus \\\\\"Previous Page\\\\\"), navigating is a snap.<br />- The size of the device is just right - it is very easy to hold and read in bed, at a table, on the couch etc.  More on this in the \\\\\"Needs Work\\\\\" section.  But to be clear, my Kindle goes everywhere with me - the doctor's office, the park, the bus etc.<br />- Pricing on Books is good - I would easily pay $9.99 on a title, especially as we run out of library space at home.  I read my first novel in a long time thanks to the Kindle (the book - \\\\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\\\\", Khaled Hosseini is a trifle predictable and irritating after The Kite Runner ')<br />- Text is very crisp and easy to read - as I said above, very immersive.<br />- Love the quick charging and overall battery life.<br />- Love the integrated web and Wikipedia search.  I also checked my gmail account from time to time - horrible user experience, but had to be a true geek and say that I did it '<br /><br />Needs Work (in no particular order of priority)<br />- The case is a disaster.  The device does not sit in it firmly, and while it looks nice when closed with the elastic band etc, what is really more practical is a sack of some sort, because you really need to take the device out of the case to read effectively and ergonomically.  This has to fixed, hopefully through a rich third party accessory community.<br />- As I read my novel, I often hit the side buttons accidentally and lost my place in the book (either fell asleep with my hand on the buttons, or was walking somewhere with the device without putting it to sleep, or kids got a hold of it etc etc).  Bottom line, getting back to the right spot was very hard. I had to remember to bookmark every time I anticipated a disruption.  Remembering location numbers is not too practical, since they can run into 4 digits in a long book.  Accidentally pressing the wrong buttons is a also a problem when holding the book out of the case (which is more intuitive for reading)<br />- One thing that is physically intuitive while reading a paper book is knowing exactly where you are, as measured by the pages completed/remaining.  Making that same leap using location numbers and the indicator at the bottom is not (yet) that intuitive, so I was bit disoriented when people asked me questions like \\\\\"how far are you into the book?\\\\\"<br />- The silvery indicator to the right (above the wheel) is not very visible in low light conditions or when there is some reflective directly in front of the device.<br />- It would be nice to have an option (on the Home screen) to group all your content into Books, Magazines, Newspapers etc.<br />- Charging for papers and blogs does not make too much sense - this content is available for free, with rich graphics and color, on the web.  Over time, I see myself reading books and documents on the Kindle, not newspapers and blogs unless the format is made more rich on the device.<br />- Graphics is very rudimentary.  It's nice to see the device render pictures with stories in the Times etc, but the quality of the images harkens back to 1991 x486 computing.<br />- Keyboard latency is a bit painful, but am sure this will get fixed soon.<br />-Perhaps I have not had the device long enough, but it was not clear what the archival process is going to be for newspapers etc.<br />- In mirroring actual paper/ink, I think the screen background needs to be a bit brighter, without being backlit.  Right now it is gray-ish.<br />- I am sure a million others have already said so, so let me be #1,000,001 - $399 for the reader does not make sense for broad penetration.  And this SHOULD be broadly adopted - it is a no-brainer device in the classroom, for textbooks, course handouts, teacher communications etc.  It's a brilliant device, and it needs to be $199 or less. People will pay for the books, and other content.  It's all about the blades...rchival process is going to be for newspapers etc.  - In mirroring actual paper/ink, I think the screen background needs to be a bit brighter, without being backlit.

Sony could've also made it so that the original PsOne multi-tap, that many people already owned prior to owning a Ps2, was compatable, but they didn't because their new Ps2 memory cards are too big for the slots.  They could've just made the card smaller.  The one for the Game Cube is even smaller than the PsOne memory card!

It was the first 32 bit system, which was later beaten into the ground by its high price tag, lack of third party support, and the combined strength of the Sony Playstation and the Sega Saturn. However, there were some qualities about the Panasonic 3DO that I liked, that I'd never seen before on any other game console. The 3DO was a system capable of allowing as many as 10 players to participate in a game at once, with only 1 controller port, and no multi-tap. How? The answer was in the controler. At the top of each controller was a controller port, that a second player could attach his/her controller to, and so on, and so on. It was like building a chain, and the gamplay never slowed down either. I also liked how each controller featured an earphone jack and volume control.

I have tried to go to my router controls, but now I can't remember my password - totally my fault since I should be able to find it.  So then I go to the Finnoxa tech support - only there isn't any.  On their web page there is tech support for setting it up, but that is all.  There is no phone number or chat, only FAQs that have nothing to do with daily use outside of setting the router up. There is an administration heading, but when I clicked it  I got &#34;page not created yet.&#34;  The page hasn't been updated since Dec. '13.  Not a good sign.  I have also posted on their Facebook page but haven't gotten any responses.  It also doesn't seem to have much activity. I have also googled the problem, and I can't find any relevant links.  Without tech support this router is worthless.  I will be buying another one if I can't get help soon, and so far I don't see how that is possible.<br /><br />Update - I got an answer from my facebook post telling where to go for help.  They also told me to use the black button on the back of the router to reset it back to default.  I did this, so I was able to access the router and do everything that I need to do.  I was ready to give 1 star, but gave 3 since the router works.  It is fairly easy to use to block content - which is why I bought it.  I still think help should be easier to get.  I don't think that I should have had to turn to facebook - hence the 3 stars instead of more.",

The old system shines in the whole audio spectrum but these are a bit hard in the highs to the point of pain. The mids are non existant and the lows are thunderous! Also the older system had a convenient remote and these have the controls on the right speaker which is a pain in the a to deal with. Also I think if this system had proper EQ control with basic high, mid, and low controls, it would give this system another star to make 4 total.

Although I mostly bought this to build my parts inventory, I did intend to build the thing the way it was intended as a potential starting point to future projects. I've already spent a couple of hours just deciding where things are supposed to be mounted and just general layout. My first dilemma was figuring out that the motors needed to be mounted on the yellow base and the clear acrylic was presumably there so that you could see the lower layer of the car through the top. Not a big deal since you're going to want to take everything off so that you can remove the protective paper on the acrylic. But moving the motors then led to the realization that the yellow base is quite thinner than the clear one and the screws were bottoming out on the mounting posts. Also, if you're not careful, the wheels will bind against the sides of the platform. You'll have to make sure you spin them and make sure they move freely before you tighten the screws down... and you'll need some standoff washers if you put the motors on the thinner base.<br /><br />I can only hope that whoever put together the kit built it at least once to make sure all the necessary parts were included and everything fit together and wiring reached all the appropriate places. You'd think if they did a test build, they'd have at least taken a few pictures and put it on a website somewhere.<br /><br />My hope is that this forum will become a help site for this product as more people purchase it.

Other reviews on here will tell you the wonderful assets of this laptop, my two main gripes with this thing are:  - The mouse pad. I've never used a worse pad in my life, the technology used confuses all the capabilities it can do. for instance, when I lay one finger on it to move the mouse it'll either increase or decrease the zoom lvel, sometimes the pad won't recognise my finger, and I'll be sitting there tapping it and moving my finger on it for sometimes more than 30 seconds until it actually registers I'm trying to MOVE the dang mouse.  - The wireless card is very poor in my opinion. On networks that have 1 to 3 bars out of 5 in terms of reception , this computer is terrible in bandwidth and the internet is very very slow. I compared it in exact smae conditions with my Asus EEE PC 1000HE and it blows it out of the water. Kinda sad when you think this gaming rig is 8 times the price today!

That's where my liking of that feature ends.  The content is for toddlers and babies.  Dora.  Thomas.  Caiou, Mr. Rogers (really?), Reading Rainbow, stuff like that.  I have a 3 year old and a 9 year old.  I don't see my 9 year old finding that fun at all!<br /><br />So far I'm debating returning this Kindle despite it's online uses for school to me because I shouldn't have to work so hard to figure out how to put stuff on here.  Transfering things from my computer was a slow, time consuming thing as well.  One word\u2026streamline.  I'll admit I'm a Mac user, and have been for years so I understand there will be some what of a learning curve on my end, but in todays tech savy age nothing should be this irritating to figure out.",

I I used the supplied squeegee and got what appeared to be a first rate application. So after I got the screen on, I noticed &#34;micro bubbles&#34;, which are clearly identified in the instructions as a normal occurrence, which go away after a few days according to the instructions. So, as the instructions indicate, I pulled the screen off and did it over, with the same disappointing results.

Also, this screen protector scratches easily, so be prepared for that as well, even though this is supposed to be a self- healing screen protector. Overall, it does what it's supposed to do, which is to protect the glass, but unless you've applied many of these consistently, do not expect a perfect application.

It's fast with the Intel i5 processor, and games run very well with high settings. The battery life has been great for me so far (I can usually get in at least 3 hours online), but it is still pretty new. I know some people complain about the keyboard, but I like it.   Now for the flaws... The biggest problem I have is that it gets really hot, especially gaming or watching videos, and the fans are not placed in very good locations to work properly. I do have a whining noise that is bearable, but kind of annoying sometimes. ALSO, the CD drive sounds like it's about to take off or die when a CD is put in there. Cool idea of slot load, but terrible sound and shaking. The speakers are alright. For being Beats Audio and supposedly amazing quality, they are not. I also don't like the position of them, because when I hold my computer on my lap, the speakers are muffled and covered up by my stomach. I usually just attach other speakers instead, so I don't have to deal with that. I like that this has a metal case, but it makes it quite a bit heavier. It gets really heavy carrying around in a backpack.  Overall, it works great, but with some annoying flaws.",

Also, the modem was shipped quickly and arrived only a few days after I ordered it.<br /><br />I give it only three stars for two reasons:<br />1. The item received is not the item advertised. This is advertised as a Surfboard SB5100. I received a Surfboard SB5120. They are visually indistinguishable, except for the number on the front, and I have no idea what the differences are, but I purposely ordered the SB5100 because that was what I was leasing from Comcast so I wanted to be sure they couldn't refuse to activate the one I purchased (which they did, see below). Also, the photo rather deliberately shows a Motorola box, but the item I received did not come in such a box but rather in a brown box (i.e. it may have been repackaged at some point).<br />2. This modem is considered &#34;end of life&#34; by Comcast and has been since 7/2013. When I tried (1/2015) to activate it over the phone the customer service representative refused to do so because of this, despite the fact that the SB5100 that I was leasing had also been declared end of life since 6/2013 and they never bothered to notify me or give me a new modem. Turns out that all I had to do was plug it in and try to use it and I was presented with Comcast's self-serve activation webpage through which I was able to active it in a manner of minutes. So far I am satisfied with the product (and my SB5100 gave me no problems for 2+ years), but since this product is considered &#34;end of life&#34; it is probably only a matter of time before Comcast renders it incompatible, forcing me to buy a new one. I would therefore advise others in a similar situation to purchase one that is newer and on the supported list.",

(I use the Razer Abyssus at its 1800 dpi / 125 hz setting, it can go higher but I find 3500dpi and/or 1000 hz to be overkill.) The Razer is slightly better suited for navigating across three 23\\\\\" screens without having to repeatedly pickup and reposition the mouse. The vertical/ergonomic design of this Anker is comfortable after you get used to it, but if I have to move my wrist 2x as much, it might be a zero sum game for me.

Once on, it's very slim and unobstructive and offers a very good nonslip feel, making the iPad easier to hold.  The fit is excellent.  Finish was good, with the exception of a couple grains of grit which I could feel (but not see).  In my opinion, this cover adds to the utility and very much to the appearance of the iPad.    However, I recently noticed what appeared to be a hairline crack on the case near one of the corners.  After very gently removing the shield, I noticed that there were in fact several hairline cracks, all located at/near three of the corners (and no, I didn't crack it during installation or removal).  As the iPad 2/shield had always been handled gently and never dropped, I could see no reason for the appearance of these cracks, except as through defects in manufacturing and/or design.  It's disappointing that a simple plastic cover (which was already overpriced for what it is) would develop cracks at critical stress points in such a short amount of time (if ever).  If you Google \\\\\"Belkin Snap Shield iPad 2 cracks\\\\\" or something similar, you'll find similar complaints.    I left a message for J&R to see if they will refund or replace the item (possibly a temporary fix, but I'm hoping I just got a bad unit).    If not for the corner cracks, I would have no problem giving this product five stars.    EDIT: J&R issued an RMA, but I'm stuck with the return shipping costs [keep ALL your packaging material, if you buy this].  I opted for a refund, as I think it's a design flaw.  I will be looking at other rear covers on Amazon, which is unfortunate since I really like this one.",

I too like other reviewers am an IT Professional -- admin, developer, network jockey, consultant, etc.  But I'm also very busy and don't have the time to diagnose and fully root cause like I used to.<br /><br />The goal of my purchase was to extend the wireless signal in the home to some places where the signal is weak.  Two Rokus were under consideration, one in the bedroom and one in the family room.<br /><br />On first look out of the box, the two I bought set up nicely, though I did notice some glitches with the Web UI on each extender.  Pages that had to be reloaded or wouldn't fully load, etc.  I do some Mac address mapping on the firewall for the Rokus and a couple of other devices, and there was a documented workaround for that and everything was fine there save for some run around one of the extenders gave me by setting a static address seemingly on it's own but reporting dynamic or DHCP.  Another status page helped me to see the extender had neither a gateway nor a DNS set for it's static (though reporting dynamic) and a reboot of the device set everything straight.<br /><br />All in all though I found myself rebooting the devices more than I cared for.  It was not &#34;set it and forget it&#34; as I need and ultimately, the wireless in the household became SLOWER.

Their embedded firewalls where great.  It seems the company has taken a turn in the last five years.  I'm not as impressed any more and it's probably time to upgrade the inhouse brand.

However, after a little time using them you realize that you are actually getting form over function at least when it comes to the awful mouse. While they look lovely on your desk the mouse is functional but not comfortable. After only a few minutes of use my hand began hurting. So if you plan on using this mouse for a lengthy period of time you may find it uncomfortable - after 20 minutes using this I was missing my logitech mouse which was much more comfortable.'The mouse is very shallow and takes a lot of getting used to coming from a more substantiation device.<br /><br />The keyboard on the other hand is very nice and the key response is very good. There is only a slight noise when typing and the key travel is good. I have been using a Logitech wave keyboard as my daily driver in the office and a Logitech solar k750 at home. The Microsoft keyboard has given me reason to consider ditching one of the two listed. The unit is listed as compatible with Win 8 or newer and I was able to successfully pair the mouse and the keyboard with my Win 7 laptop & a Win 8.1 desktop along with a Win 8.1 tablet.<br /><br />If you are more concerned with how your desk looks than how the tools on your desk function then this is a good combination for you.

I am no expert by any means, but wanted to AC in my desktop, as running a wire was not an option for me. I use a Apple Time Capsule with AC connection for my iMac and rest of sheeple crap.<br /><br />First of all, Asus customer service sucks its really rude, arrogant, and just down right useless. They will not resolve your use with their trouble shooting, and only good for RMA after a painful back and forth on the phone as to why you need it.<br /><br />The good: Wifi installed Windows 8.1 did not have to install anything right of the bat it was working. I was impressed as this was during the set up portion, and I did not even plug in the antenna they provided. Also, my house is all brick no dry wall here, so wifi can be skecy. It was 2/5 bars reception, but then I plugged the antenna and bam 5 bars. SpeedTest.net 15ms Latency, 96.8mg download, 15mb upload. The fit and finish seems strong looks like a sturdy board. Fan lay out is great all on the edges and not center of a board, so a clean look.<br /><br />The bad: The board could not take 64gb 8x8gb of Adata Ram at 2400mhz with the factory settings would boot loop. However, when I set it at 2133mhz it worked just fine. The Asus power boost/auto OC failed to post due to the fact it can't boot the XMP ram profile of my ram. However, at 32gb it booted, and I swapped out the ram thinking that batch was bad same story. The bios settings look pretty, but do not always apply had to re-apply settings a few times to make it work.<br /><br />Conclusion I am going to keep this board, as its to much work to take it all apart. I just got the system stable so sticking with it. However, next time around I think I will try a different manufactory or do more research very disappointed. Customer service is the major problem here honestly. If the people on the phone were a bit brighter then the dark end of the universe life would be easierwith them. Honestly, I have had deeper conversations with my Lab then them wow...<br /><br />The board will work after back and forth with it, and it don't like all ram slots filled I need the ram.

As an Ultrabook, the SS9 is an excellent product that competes with the best on the market, and generally suffers flaws similar to other ultrabooks, with caveats (keyboard and touchpad delight some and horrify others - your mileage may vary).  As anything else (eg desktop gaming, graphics, etc.) or when used beyond what it was designed for (like running 3 monitors while writing a paper while running powerpoint while checking email while running winamp off a portable drive), the SS9 becomes mediocre and hard to recommend.<br /><br />***Do not buy this as anything other than an ultrabook, because most of the features quibble about relate to uses beyond its design.***<br /><br />I bought this because my huge Quad-core desktop replacement was too heavy to lug around on campus.  Wanted something light with a decent screen and great battery life. Its limitations frustrate me, but it does what I wanted it to do otherwise.<br /><br />**********Pros***********<br /><br />As a machine for school it has very fast boot and transfer via USB3, it's light, I get a full day's worth of use out of a single charge, and it recharges quickly.  Has a nice screen that allows outdoor use.<br /><br />Build is aesthetically pleasing, nice webcam, fairly useful system software, minimal bloatware.<br /><br />Designers eliminated ports/components that don't enhance the intended ultraportability (namely the DVD ROM and full-sized ports) and replaced them with mini-ports.<br /><br />Runs very cool and quiet - I've never heard the fan kick on before.<br /><br />***********Features that have mixed reviews**************<br /><br />Touchpad:  Essentially, people who like or dislike the pad make the same observations:  It's large, sensitive, and designed to be used in a specific way based on gestures and zones.  So, if you've got big hands and long fingers like I do, and you take time to learn how to use it, and of course if you patch it from original drivers to current, it ranks among the best pads to be released (IMHO) in spite of a few bugs.  Those with smaller hands, clumsy fingers, impatience, or those who expect the pad to do what they want it to do in the manner that they want it (instead of how it was programmed) will hate it.  If you plan to buy this laptop, if at all possible you should testdrive the pad because it's a make/break feature for many.<br /><br />Keyboard - Keystrokes are shallow, not much recoil, keyboard is sort of cramped, and the ease by which you can accidentally hit the touchpad and move the cursor while typing is a huge deal-breaking annoyance to many.  I had that problem often, depending on the angle that I'm typing from.  It's irritating as an ant bite between your toes.  That said, we all have different tastes in keyboards. Those with smaller hands or people who have nimble fingers probably won't mind the keyboard.  Personally, I prefer deep keys on a full-sized keyboard with lots of recoil.  My hands are big and I type like I play the piano - percussively.<br /><br />**************Minor Cons********************<br /><br />HD could have been bigger, and having to pay extra to get Win7 on the machine (given that Win8 is geared towards touchscreens) ticked me off.<br /><br />*********************Cons************************<br /><br />It appears that when closed, the keyboard contacts the screen.  This lead to a nick in my screen, and requires me to clean the screen fairly often.<br /><br />The Intel HD card SUUCCCKKKSSS.  I've experienced all sorts of graphical corruption with certain applications, acceleration is non-existent, the control panel interface can't be configured for three monitors (which I do run at home using my Series 9), and the driver has a tendency to crash.  I run my computers hard, so it's possible that single-taskers / surfers won't run into the same problems.  Worst of all, though - when you hook up a second or third monitor (via the mini-HDMI), the second screen has a tendency to momentarily disconnect and reconnect (takes about 5 seconds) and at this time there is no fix.  ****One more thing - my mini-hdmi will do the same thing (on/off) if I bump the cord even slightly.  Has anyone else experienced this? In any event, these problems relate primarily to uses of the machine beyond its intent (ultraportable), so take that into consideration.  This isn't a desktop replacement.<br /><br />Some folks say that the HD is cheap and should be replaced - I can't comment on that.<br /><br />The ports are all fairly tight - it's kind of hard to fit the power adapter and mini-hdmi adapters into the ports.  It worries me given the lightness and build of the machine.  This is one aspect of the design that might prove detrimental in the long run.<br /><br />The backlit keyboard is marginally useful - only in a dark lecture room has it actually been useful.<br /><br />Could have used a fourth USB port.  Assembly feels a little flimsy in some places.<br /><br />I boughtis b ecause my desktop replacement Dv6 Quad Core Edition (8g RAM, 1 Gg dedicated video card) was too heavy to lug around.h I was a little skeptical about the Series 9's video capabilities because it has the intel HD 4000, whereas at home I ran three monitors off the Dv6.  After a couple of weeks, here are my thoughts --<br /><br />First and foremost, the Series 9 is capable of three monitors, but the Intel Graphics Manager is clunky and doesn't seem to support the configuration.  Rather, I use a USB adapter for the monitor and it works fine, with the caveat that switching between the configurations (eg, from desk to school and back) is kind of annoying because it doesn't always snap back to the native screen.  Also, having multiple monitors running seems to screw up other software aspects - for example, because a monitor has speakers, bluetooth seems to no longer pick up my bluetooth wireless speakers.<br /><br />The laptop runs cool at all times, and handles basic stuff like office, browsing, movies, streaming video, etc. with speed and fluidity.  It isn't as fast as my old desktop replacement, but I can forgive this because it has one half the processing power.  One thing that puzzles me - for some reason, Google Chrome seems to hang when opening multiple tabs on this laptop - I have no idea if it is the laptop or some addon, but I can't reproduce the error on other machines.<br /><br />The screen is fantastic, if a bit bright.  Works fine outside as well as it does inside.  The hinge for folding the screen back and forth is nice and tight.  The webcam is a basic webcam, no frills.<br /><br />Could have used a fourth USB port.  Assembly feels a little flimsy in some places.",

If you leave this tablet running with the screen locked, it will not last a day. The charger is proprietary! It uses about 15V to charge, so it will not charge from USB, or standard cell phone or tablet chargers. Another issue I have with it is that the screen is not very responsive to touch. You have to tap things multiple times to get them to react.<br /><br />I use this just in my living room, using Chromecast to watch shows and movies on the TV. I always have to shut it down when finished, or else the battery will be dead the next day. I keep going back to my old Motorola Xoom. Aside from its nice looks and finish, this is the worst tablet I have ever had. Time for a yard sale!",

The router lost communication with the modem and all devices on my LAN that were attached to the router lost connection with the rest of the network.  The 5Ghz light went out, and the internet connection light intermittently went from blue to red and back again.<br /><br />I tried rebooting (and resetting the router, rebooting the modem and replacing my ethernet cables...still, nothing.  I connected a desktop directly to the modem and was able to get online...which leads me to believe that the ASUS RT-AC87U is the source of the problem.<br /><br />It is a shame, for the first few days my experiences with the ASUS RT-AC87U were promising.  Now it is has caused me a morning of missed work and troubleshooting headaches.<br /><br />This unit will be going back and I will begin searching for a new router.<br /><br />UPDATE [October 10, 2014]:  I decided to try to reset the router to factory default settings one final time before returning the router (this was the third time doing so)...and the router began working again.  I will still probably return the ASUS-RT-AC87U, as I don't trust it stability...but I Just wanted to update to say that, after a day of trying, I was able to get it back up and running.",

Sometimes it would be OK but most of the time the pointer would jump all over the screen.  I could even have the mouse stationary on the desk with nothing touching it or pulling on the cord and watch the mouse travel across my screen. I received a Long Email from Razer TS about what to do about this but it seemed that the mouse was defective so I ordered a replacement. The replacement came from Amazon fast and I tried again. I even bought a new mouse pad that was light in color (the Razer TS said use a white piece of paper!) and while it was improved the mouse cursor still traveled and it seemed that if the mouse was being used a lot (like in a MMORPG game) then the cursor became impossible to control.  And even though it has a nice hand-feel my hand got cramped just trying to re-center the mouse all the time.  So it's a nice mouse but if you don't have the right computer rig then it might not work for you.  It certainly did not work \\\\\"out of the box\\\\\" for me.",

Once the initial horror of setup was over, I've been happily connected ever since.  And you can't beat the price: Linksys gear is dropping in price, likely due to a ramp-up of pre-N gear on the horizon.  (That's the new 802.11n standard which promises 6x the g-rate, and pre-N Belkin gear is delivering triple the speeds, so 150Mbps, or nearly 19 MBps).<br /><br />The bad?  Customer support, or lack thereof.  I had a problem with the client not seeing the router.  The *real* problem was the firewall on the basement machine.  However, mention the words \\\\\"Workgroup\\\\\" or \\\\\"file and printer sharing\\\\\" to a Live Chat Specialist and watch how fast they come back with \\\\\"we don't support configuring Windows\\\\\" and a link to a knowledgebase article that will not give you a step-by-step diagnostic.<br /><br />That's a shame, because a troubleshooting map would come in real handy.  I fixed the problem myself -- I usually do with rare exception -- but for the non-IT professional, I fear for you.  It's Belkin or Netgear for me next time.<br /><br />And even more: the DHCP server on these routers are apparently very flaky.  I could never get mine to give up an IP address to my WMP54GS card, so in the ened I configured it for a static IP and was connected.  Woe to the inexperienced customer who tries to get an IP from one of these automatically.  This issue is known throughout the Internet, but good luck trying to get Linksys to admit the problem and fix it.<br /><br />The ugly?  Try installing it.  IF you manage to see your router on the first shot, your karma is perfect and heaven awaits you.  Sinners like myself are forced to install the Linksys drivers only after the failed promise of Wireless Zero Configuration fails.  Yes, you'll be switching between the Windows config and Linksys config a few times until you get it right.  My suggestion would be to ensure you can see the router first (channel selection being the biggest 'gotcha' here), then worry about encryption and such.<br /><br />Also, don't be surprised if the DHCP server on the WRT54GS router doesn't give you an IP address.  It's a known issue to the outside world, which is waiting for Linksys to admit it and fix it.  Configuring your WMP54GS with a static IP will get you fully connected in every case.<br /><br />I have companion reviews for the WRT54GS and WUSB11, also Linksys gear.

            "input": "The Linksys WRT54G and WRT54GS routers have been the number one most popular wireless router devices available for the past few years. So this begs the question why Cisco would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by needlessly changing an almost perfect product.  The fact is that versions 1 -4 of the G and the GS (with Speedboost) versions of this router were fantastic. Those earlier routers run a flexible and powerful Linux based firmware that has been perfected for the past few years a numerous updates and tweaks. However, the earlier WRT54G product has now been replaced with a less powerful wireless product (version 5) that has had its onboard flash RAM chopped in half from 4MB to 2MB and its system RAM cut from 16MB to 8MB.  Instead of the flexible, reliable and powerful Linux firmware the new WRT54G version 5 routers run the licensed VxWorks firmware instead. There is nothing wrong with using VxWorks and over time Cisco will probably work out the bugs but for now the newest wireless routers are not reliable.       Why would Cisco do this to its most popular Linksys brand of wireless routers ?  Apparently it might be a case where the first four versions were too flexible for their own good. The open source Linux firmware with the large amount of flash and system memory was attractive to many third party independent software developers that were turning the WRT54G and GS routers into powerhouse micro Linux wireless computers with a functionality approaching and often surpassing the $600+ wireless routers that Cisco sells.  There might also have been an excess number of product warranty returns for the WRT54G routers due to so many people flashing them with non-Linksys third party firmware that sometimes can \\\\\"brick\\\\\" a router or make it unusable.    Your solution is to either look for a previous version of the \\\\\"WRT54G\\\\\" router before version 5 or purchase the \\\\\"WRT54GS\\\\\" (SpeedBooster) version 4 which as of the posting of this review is still available in the stores and it still uses the popular Linux firmware. You will pay $20 more for the GS model but compared to the version 5 of the G model it is worth the extra money. The GS models 1 - 4 are all good with GS version 3.0 and 3.1 reportedly being the most flexible of the bunch and GS 4.0 being the latest. If you want to use third party firmware you may want the GS versions 2.0 - 3.0/3.1 since they have the most flash RAM while still having newer Broadcom based processors. Finally, if you do plan to flash your WRT54G with third party firmware the  ones before version 4 of the WRT54G wireless routers are supposed to be easier to work with.     How do you find which version you are looking for? Look on the bottom of the box near the scan tag for the serial number of the router. For the WRT54G wireless routers look for CDFA or a CDF9 or lower (CDF8, CDF7, 6, etc.)  Any serial number with CDF5 (v2.0) through CDF9 (v3.1) are the most flexible for use with third party firmware. Unless you want to use a more risky third party firmware I recommend that you read the manual instructions on how to carefully flash these older router models with a newer Linksys firmware which is designed for that specific router version. The latest official Linksys firmware for each specific version of router can be obtained from the Linksys support site.  Completely avoid the WRT54G routers with the \\\\\"CDFB\\\\\" (v5.0) serial numbers since those are the buggy VxWorks versions. You could also simply purchase the WRT54GS (v4.0) routers that say Speedboost on the box. You will see the \\\\\"CGN6\\\\\" serial numbers on the box and as of this review these were still using Linux firmware with software based SpeedBoost enhancements but the RAM and hardware inside seems to be essentially the same as the older WRT54G (v4.0) version 4.  The WRT54GS v2.0 (CGN3) through v3.0 (CGN5) are also good and will have more flash RAM available if you want use the wireless router with third party firmware. I would like to note that flashingthe router with firmware other than an official Linksys releases obtained from the Linksys support web site will void the warranty and can result in a \\\\\"bricked\\\\\" or damaged router.      PROS: The most popular, flexible, reliable and highly rated wireless router on the market before the WRT54G version 5. Previous versions could be flashed with powerful third party firmware. The latest WRT54GS v4.0 routers can still be purchased and except for the SpeedBoost software enhancement (including a different version of Linux based firmware) they are essentially the same as older WRT54G v4.0 routers.    CONS: The latest version 5 has less Flash and System RAM and uses a buggy non-Linux based firmware.  There is no rumor of this yet but in the near future Cisco might also release a newer WRT54GS router non-Linux based router (WRT54GS v5.0 ???)     CONCLUSION: With all the changes to the memory and the firmware this latest G model is really a very different product and Cisco should have changed the model number altogether. Neverless, I hope that Cisco works out the bugs in their current version so that the G version can at least partially return to its glory days. There are rumors that a still newer model popular Linux based router might be re-released with the model name of WRT54GL but until that happens we can still purchase a very good WRT54GS v4.0 Speedbooster model.     THE BOTTOM LINE: I give five stars to the older WRT54G models and five stars to the latest WRT54GS model. But I give only one star for the newest WRT54G version 5 which averages the score to only 2.5 stars (rounded down to 2 stars since v5.0 is the newest and most abundant WRT54G model that you can find in the stores).",

I then decided to buy a second one since I was so pleased with the product. Fast forward to one year later, just after warranty expiration. Both of them have started to work erratically a few weeks ago. At times, the mouse does not respond at all. After some troubleshooting I found that in both cases, the problem stems from the connection between the USB cable and the mouse. After the mouse stops working, if I wiggle the cable that comes out from the top of the mouse, the red light inside the mouse comes on again for a while.For this problem to occur on both my units, it is unlikely just bad luck. There seems to be a design flaw that Microsoft will have to adress. In the meantime, I might just try my luck with Logitech's optical mouse.

These issues along with the frequent charging issues, example: It will have spastic battery life, sometimes it lasts for 4 hours sometimes 1 or 2, its so random I end up having to just have it plugged in most of the time. The battery icon is inaccurate, and apparently is known to fail.    Reading online about these parts I learned these companies participate in a practice where when the product is first shipped they use high quality parts but over-time they just outsource to Chinese companies and replace most of the parts with cheep knockoffs shortening the lifespan of the product.    Another issue you will face is the drivers for the \\\\\"5.1 surround sound\\\\\" which is actually just a software hack to make it appear to be 5.1...this would not be an issue for me except it likes to break half the games I play, you can flip the switch on the headset to toggle stereo but a lot of the times it just does nothing.    Volume. The newer drivers for this headset limit your ability to increase the sound...I assume for safety reasons, but there are some games like wolfenstein where the audio is just naturally low and you would like to increase it....and you cant. If  you downgrade the drivers you get more access to sound options and even the ability to go higher than normal, at the cost of the play/forward/back buttons.

The screen resolution was the most obvious one but we figured for the price we paid, we could deal with it. The equivalent specs were there, so good to go, right?<br /><br />Well, no. Battery life was the first straw of many to break this camel's back. During a session of normal WiFi usage, you can literally watch the battery drain percent by percent. Even with brightness turned down and gps/location settings locked down, it leaks power like a sieve compared to my dearly departed Sero. Secondly, the screen was a disappointment as well. 1080x600 is adequate, but the overall resolution lends a muddy appearance to display. It also makes for a lot of home screen dead space along the edges.<br /><br />Besides the battery life and poor screen quality, there was the fact that the Android OS will eat up about 4 of your 8gb, leaving you with about half the memory you're expecting. It also seemed to have trouble maximizing memory usage, though how much of that due to the Android OS or iview's hardware configuration is unknown. The on-board cameras are usually a lost cause with any device in this hardware class, and the Iview is no exception.

Alas.    The first problem was the box.  The outer box opened as all boxes do, but inside was a very nicely made cardboard rectangle.  I studied it for 3 minutes.  Tried various methods.  Ten minutes.  Tried brute force.  There was no conceivable way to open it.  I have never had a problem opening a box before.  This was puzzling.  I took my pen knife to it, but this was some high grade cardboard and it was ineffective.  A steak knife made more progress, but was still too slow.  A chef's knife did the trick.    The next problem was how to register it at my house, but allow her to use it at her house.  I went online and created an Amazon account for her, but, of course, it wanted her email address.  If there were email messages sent to finish the registration process I'd never see them.  Hmmm.  I probably made some wrong assumptions, but in any case instead of a 5 minutes, registration took an hour.    So now we were ready to download a book.  But although I could set the text of documents at a larger font, there didn't seem to be a way to make the UI larger too.  My mom couldn't read it.  Ignoring that for the time being we made our way to History books.  The books were listed in two columns.  My mom had to click down twice and once right to check out a D-Day book.  She held the toggle down instead of clicking and I have no idea where we ended up.  Five minutes later I got us back to the same spot and reminded her how to click.  Clicking is not pressing.  She held it down again and all was lost again.  With her lower lip trembling she said, \\\\\"This is too hard for me.  I don't want it.  You take it.\\\\\"    So now I have a new Kindle and mom has a big new monitor instead.    To sum up I would not get a Kindle for anyone with poor vision.  This gadget is very wellmade, delicately made with precision, but my mom could not see the very light grey labels on the buttons.  Could not see where one button ended and another began.  This gadget is made for three foot elves I think, with great vision and very tiny fingers.    P.S.  If you envisioned reading with the Kindle on a plane with the overhead light off ... nope nope.

Occasionally would get a lock, but more often than not, would not work. I'm a software developer and wrote a GPS app that uses the windows sensor API. (I also downloaded a GPS app off the app store to make sure that it just wasn't my software that did not recognize a valid lock very often) Basically, the GPS is present and does work maybe 10% of the time. When it does work, it may choose a particular constellation, but then all of a sudden changes the chosen constellation for the solution, and gets out of lock. Interestingly, it is seeing GLONASS satellites as well as USA satellites when it's in a good mood! Does not use the GLONASS satellites for the lock however.<br />I researched the GPS chipset in this thing, and it seems fine. They are using the Broadcom BCM4752, which, according to the website, is a highly sensitive, &#34;modern&#34; GPS. I'm not sure what Lenovo did wrong. Perhaps it's a poor antenna? Perhaps interference from other high frequency signals on the motherboard? Who knows? Lenovo has a driver on their website called the &#34;<br />Hiking GPS Driver&#34;. There is no description on what the term &#34;Hiking&#34; means. I think this is just the standard GPS driver. I tried installing it after poor results with the unit out of the box, but this did not help. The driver is written by Broadcom, not Lenovo. The driver is very new. Perhaps it is buggy? Maybe have to wait for a new driver.<br /><br />In summary, a great unit, but if you need GPS, look elsewhere!",

When I saw the M557, I thought Logitech brought it back with new technology (maybe better tracking? maybe longer battery life?).  While this mouse looks strikingly like the old M555, it is nothing like it at all.  I used the M555 in a Linux environment. The M557 seems to hate Linux bluetooth. If it gets disconnected at any point, it will not automatically reconnect. It has to be removed in Linux, then re-added.  The scroll wheel is no longer a dual mode wheel (notched vs free wheeling) and is now the middle click button. I had 3 Logitech mice in the past, including the MX Anywhere mouse and the old M555, where this was not a button and got use to using the button behind the wheel. This mouse has a button behind the wheel but it is NOT a middle click button. It sends the Windows key.  Lastly, getting to the batteries is a challenge. Perhaps the claimed long battery life overcomes this problem, but the old way from the M555 was much better.  I'm honestly not sure why Logitech released the M557 to pose as the old M555. Sure, it's bluetooth like the old M555, but in terms of function outside of that, it is nothing like the M555. This mouse does nothing but frustrate me. I give it 2 stars simply because it at lest functions, and maybe someone will be okay with it.",

I edit pictures so when I zoom in/out it makes it very difficult. Sometimes it doesn't zoom and sometimes it zoom in but out the next second. Basically there is something wrong with the mouse. I tested my old ball mouse from Dell which is probably 5 years old and it worked perfectly except I don't like the ball feature. So here I am looking for another mouse online. Saw the one I already own and thought might as well review it. If any of you know a good laser mouse please suggest because too many of them have bad ratings. Maybe laser mouse break down fast. If that's the case with all of them then buy this because it really was a great mouse until it broke after 12 months. It's still useable but it's very frustrating.",

While the pain I was suffering did decrease, the fact that these are filled with small, hard-plastic beads (and they are only loosely-filled at that) meant that the more narrow point of contact for my elbows did not receive the same level of cushioning that my wrists would have received had I needed these for that purpose.<br /><br />The other problem is that while the cushions have a non-slip backing, if you change positions throughout the day (such as when using your mouse or swapping between your keyboard and a book, etc.) the back surface will begin to lose traction as dust begins to adhere to the surface over time. While this might actually be a positive if you are using it as a wrist rest for your mouse hand, considering their small size, they are problematic as elbow rests.<br /><br />Why? Well once these start to slip, they'll either end up on your lap or on the floor. And heaven help you if you roll over one in your office chair. If you do, there's a good chance that the elastic fabric will run up into the more hollow interior of the caster taking with it a good number of the beads. When this happens, it is essentially like inflating a balloon in an enclosed space -- one that you can't get the air back out of. As of now *both* my cushions have met a messy end as no amount of care was able to get them dislodged without tearing the seams and spilling the trapped beads everywhere.<br /><br />So just beware that while these cushions may work fine as wrist rests, they make for mediocre elbow pads that you may very well end up ruining.",

Can't be done.<br />- Instructions are horrible. Some would say that is expected for the price - but I am sick of excuses from these foreign manufacturers. Documentation is an easy problem to fix.<br />- The sunshade is useless in my opinion.<br />- If you plan on using it for any extended period away from an outlet buy extra batteries. I bought an extra and for the limited use I made of this thing I had to use both batteries a lot.<br />- Cheap<br />PROS<br />- Cheap<br />COMMENTS<br />This is not an HD monitor. I knew that going in. What I didn't really understand was how poor the resolution really is. Unless you have great eyesight - this monitor will add little value in my opinion.

I have replaced this with a 24&#34; Samsung that was $50 cheaper and light years ahead in image quality and control. I rigged a tripod mount for the TV for around $10 and it is stable.

I would not recommend purchasing this again for the $25 as I'm sure there must be a better cover - here are my reasons why:  1. I noticed sometimes moisture can collect between the keyboard cover and the keys itself. I'm not sure if that's due to heat from my laptop, the cover itself reacting to the heat, or what. I would try to wipe down the keyboard every now and then with a paper towel and wash the keyboard cover with a sponge in the sink.  2. After a short while, the cover stretches and doesn't fit the keys exactly as it first did. It's gotten to the point now that if I were to try to lay down the cover completely flat against the keyboard like how it's supposed to be, half of the cover doesn't fit the keys properly.  3. There are now tears that have formed on some of the keys on the cover - namely A, S, D and E and very small tears on R and T (probably because they are the most used letters?). I do not always have long fingernails nor do I use anything that would cause the cover to tear so I'm not sure why it would tear (maybe it is the fingernails but I'm not sure because my nails are usually kept very short). I think maybe it's just natural wear and tear. Because of this, I need to check under the cover more frequently to see if there is any buildup of dust or dead skin cells and such, which there are and then I have to clean the keyboard, negating the purpose of this cover.  I hope this helps - I'm going to try a different cover now that this one is basically dead and see how it goes.",

I thought, \\\\\"How bad can it be?\\\\\" Hmmmm, \\\\\"Atrocious, Baleful, Contemptible, Deplorable, Execrable, Frightful...\\\\\" Too bad the English alphabet has only twenty-six letters; there are so many more words to describe how truly awful it is.     Although you can adjust the sharpness slightly by moving the tiny ring on the lens, the displayed image appears as though viewed through waxed paper. Without the additional purchase of eCamm's iUSBCam software it doesn't work at all, and you'll find even that software truly and still requires the additional purchase of the sister product, iGlasses, to get a picture that doesn't approximate the glowing blobs described by someone who has been abducted by extra-terrestrials. Lighting is tricky ... it doesn't like low light or shadows. but too much light, as from a desk lamp set to illuminate your face, makes your image glow as though it were radioactive.    The field of vision is oddly short and long, like a 3x5 index card. The preview app, if left in the dock, is helpful for adjusting the ambient light before attempting to use iChat and, despite complaints, will turn off both the camera and its little green light.  The USB connector must be connected directly to the computer or a powered hub. But the twisty cable is only about twelve inches from connecter to lens, and so rigid at the ends that it protrudes inconveniently far, wasting a good bit of the gooseneck type coil. Oddly, this coil, with all the strength of overcooked spaghetti, actually strengthens when bent or twisted lightly. However, that action further lowers the positioning on my eMac, requiring me to look down and to the side to appear as though I am looking into the eyes of the person I'm iChatting. If I try to look at their image on the display, what they see is me looking in any direction but theirs.     Yes, it's portable; but aren't they all? Yes it's inexpensive; but the add-ons more than double the price.Overall, a purchaser would be a thousand percent better off buying another brand that's plug-and-play compatible. This is pretty much a waste of money, time, and effort ... unless you're doing a report on disabilities. If you are writing about eyesight and want to experience for yourself how severe cataracts affect the vision of someone before surgical removal, this camera is IDEAL. And, just as people who've had their cataracts removed marvel at how clear and bright the world becomes post-op, shifting from this camera to just about anything else will have you shouting, I'VE BEEN CURED!

            "input": "My first adventure into tablets began with the original iPad.  While it was an introduction, the limits of iOS drove me to look further.  I then discovered the Motorola Xoom.  What a FANTASTIC device at the time.  I only recently sold it, after owning it for several years.  It reached the end of its software updates.  Then I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0.  Another GREAT tablet, but ATT decides not to update it to the latest versions of Android, and it gets left collecting dust.  (DO NOT BUY A TABLET FROM A CELL PROVIDER.  They don't keep up with the updates).  I then thought I would give Apple another try, and bought an iPad 4.  That lasted about 3 days, and I gave it to my 5 year old daughter.  No offense to her, but iPads are designed for the dumb people who cannot comprehend technology.  I doubt I'll EVER go back to a mobile Apple device.  To limited.  I decided to look into getting a Nexus 10. I am all about the Vanilla Android experience.  Nothing is better than good ol stock Android.  But, about that time, they discontinued it, assuming to make way for a new device for Q4 2014.<br /><br />So what do I do in the meantime?<br /><br />Well, thats where this beast caught my eye.  12.2\\\\\" of pure Android goodness.  Or so I thought.<br /><br />I will begin by saying the screen is sufficiently pleasing to look at.  I don't care if it has the most dpi, or 4K resolution.  Its a TABLET.  It is very lightweight (unless you put an Otterbox case on it) and easy to hold.  It doesn't make my arms tired.  I also like the dual speaker placement on the side of the tablet.  Makes watching movies a pleasure, especially if you hold it in that area and use the cups of your hands as acoustic amplifiers.  The new charging cable, I don't care for.  It causes me to have to buy a few more to carry in the car, or to have in different rooms.  Not a deal breaker, but more of an annoyance.  The deal breaker has been that with the specs this tablet boasts, the software is buggy and laggy.  Often times I have to repeated press an app, or a link in a browser just for it to recognize that I am trying to DO SOMETHING.  This is unacceptable.  The mail app freezes.  Often times I have to restart the tablet just to get it to function again.  I have had issues with apps just suddenly stopping and closing.  Most often YouTube, or another video app.  Could be the apps themselves, not sure.  But the response time of scrolling, and switching from app to app is abysmal.  For a new release tablet, it behaves like one from 2008.  It's running Android 4.4.2 which is nearly the latest.  But the downside is that it is Samsung TouchWiz, which is garbage.  From past experiences with Samsung, getting to the latest 4.4.4 will take eons.<br /><br />I have experienced slow wi-fi, and frequent disconnects.  I wonder if the wifi radio is bad.  Sitting next to other devices with full signal, this will only report 2/3 of of the signal strength my phone does.  Also, the battery life is TERRIBLE.  I used it on a recent trip, and even an 1/4 brightness, I only got around 6 hours before I had to recharge it.  Thankfully the airports have charging stations.<br /><br />I'm not knocking the Android platform.  Just the way it is poorly incorporated into THIS tablet.  TouchWiz sucks.  Android 5.0 comes out this fall.  Good luck EVER receiving that update to this tablet.  I will wait and get it in vanilla flavor on a tablet that will actually perform properly.  All in all, I am pretty displeased with the Tab Pro 12.2.  I wanted to LOVE it.  But I just cannot.  The performance is too off to justify keeping it.  I don't know if I got a bad one, or what, but it's going back to Amazon for a refund.  I will just wait and see what Google introduces this fall.  You cannot go wrong with the Nexus lineup.<br /><br />Sadly, I am now stuck with a $120 Otterbox case I cannot use.<br /><br />***11/18/14 UPDATE***<br /><br />Sadly, I missed the return window, so I'm stuck with this hunk of crap.  Justtoday, I read through all of the bad reviews, and I can safely say I have experienced everything mentioned.  This tablet sucks.  Battery life at 50% brightness is 4 hours at best.  Normally, batteries take some time to balance out and become better...this one got worse.  I can take it off the charger, read the news, check email, maybe Facebook a bit while enjoying my morning coffee, and within a few hours, I am at less that 30% battery left.  Just sitting unplugged overnight from a full charge, it will guzzle 20% of the battery.  This is unacceptable.  YMMV, but I advise staying away from this tablet, unless you don't care to blow $550.00ay I have experienced everything mentioned.  This tablet sucks.

They do not seem to have any clue about what decent customer support is. I ordered a 4gb ram upgrade from them direct. They do not have a distribution center here in US, it had to come from China. They take 2 weeks to process the order then ship UPS ground. I also ordered the 3 year extended warranty. They took my money right away but never sent the warranty. called customer support, was told they would email me in 2 days, never heard from them again on the issue. Luckily I paid with PP and have filed a dispute to get a refund. Their support is totally unsatisfactory. They have a forum, before you buy any of their product I recommend you visit the forum and see for yourself the nightmares owners of their products are having. I wish I had done this before buying. I figure if their support is this bad I can not imagine the problems one would have should you ever need to send it back for warranty work. I recommend if you are looking for a computer before buying, look at support reviews first, then you will not waste your hard earned money and make a good decision. Bottom line, if your going to spend this kind of money you should be entitled to good support. Without good customer support your really taking a chance on a product or manufacturer.

Also I was not even able to plug the USB cable into any type of extension cord.  If I did it would pop up a annoying error message saying the device may not charge when sleeping.<br /><br />The user interface is also terrible..  Loading, organizing and switching to apps was a pain in the neck. I could note even fully close them without going through a bunch of menus. Browsing the web also sucks as some webpages I was not even able to click on anything they would just do nothing as others would keep stalling. Also when I would click on a link it would instead click on the wrong link.  It was annoying to say the least when I was reading forums and I went to click on the comment and instead it clicked on the comment on the top or bottom.  Then when I was typing on this thing it would keep auto correcting words so badly that they were not even right.  For example I would type in br (a HTML code) and it would change it to breadcrumbs automatically without even asking me.  Backspacing and typing br again it would change it back to breadcrumbs.  I felt like tossing this thing out the window after that.<br /><br />I hated having the power and volume buttons on the back. It was so easy to just have them on the side like other devices especially when it was in the case.  I would go to adjust the volume and I would have to lift the device to get to the back buttons.  I could not even have the device flat down without having to lift it up to adjust the volume.  That is so unnecessary.<br /><br />Then Amazon store app selection also sucks so badly. There was not even a Speedtest.net app. I was only able to find a few of the many other apps I use everyday.  I tried so much to like my Kindle Fire HDX but in the end I ended up returning it.uld not even have the device flat down without having to lift it up to adjust the volume.

The d2 is a solid feeling device and is very attractive.  The feature set is impressive for the price.  In terms of hardware quality, it seems like a nice product.<br /><br />But, it did not work well at all in my OS X Lion environment.  LaCie says it is Lion compatible, but my experience is otherwise.  It was easily found on my network - attached on a wired ethernet connection administered by a gigabit hub Airport Extreme combo.  The problems came with stable access to the drive and the inability of Time Machine to reliably find the disk.  Time Machine would work for about a day, and then lose the disk.  The Network Assistant software was clunky and not user friendly.  Reconnecting to the disk when it was lost by Time Machine, or when shares did not show up, was akin to setting up anew.  Having to tend to settings and administer the drive on a daily basis is simply not acceptable performance.<br /><br />The provided instructions are of no help.  I did better searching Google and Apple communities.  I called LaCie on two occasions to see about what set up I might have over looked.  They were very nice, but not helpful.  They basically tinkered much the same as I did - which is not good as I am FAR from well versed with NAS devices.  The stability of connection to the drive was never corrected.  In fact, when it was obvious that LaCie had no ability to rectify the problems with the interface with Lion, they could not even provide accurate instruction on how to wipe the drive of my data before returning it.  Ultimately, I was able to restore it to factory setting, which then enabled reformatting.  My conclusion, this is a product to be avoided if you are running OS X Lion.  I never made it work on my Mac to even endeavor to set up any other devices, so I cannot comment on Windows performance or media streaming, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt and not go all the way to one star.it the benefit of the doubt and not go all the way to one star.",

            "input": "I have had my Dell Precision M3800 laptop now for almost a week. I use the machine for MathCAD engineering, Adobe Photoshop CS6 and office apps. It is incredibly fast for all applications.  The Windows 7 Performance Information and Tools performance ratings place it on par with the Dell XPS 8700 desktop that I just bought last month. That is impressive for a laptop that weighs less than five pounds. The 510 GB SSD boot drive is really fast.  With the screen set to 3200 x 1800 pixels, the colors and contrast are amazing. It looks like my iPad Retina display...just bigger.  However, there are some issues when processing images with CS6. The menus and icons in Photoshop are really small regardless of the screen resolution you select. I hope that Adobe is smart enough to come out with a version for upgrade (not a CC version) that works well with the screen.  When not using CS6, I change the screen to 2048 x 1152 for some jobs just so I can read the fine print.  You should be aware that the M3800 is not as advertised by Dell, and it does not have the options shown in the user manual. Thus, my four star rating.  First, the only option for batteries is the 91 Wh battery; there is no 61 Wh battery in stock at Dell and there may never be one available according to their parts dept.  Second, and more importantly for those of you who want internal storage and backup, you cannot get the laptop with an internal 1 TB HDD in addition to the 510 GB SATA SSD because the 91 Wh battery consumes the space where you would install the HDD. If you want a spinning HDD, your only option is to use an external USB-connected drive.  If Dell ever decides to make a 61 Wh battery for the machine, you will be able to install one and a spinning HDD, or maybe a second SSD drive for data storage and backup. In the meantime, I will just use my UDMA2 HyperDrive Colorspace or another external drive for backup in the field.  Update January 18, 2014:  I decided to buy an external portable drive to use with the Dell M3800. I selected the WD My Passport Ultra 2TB USB 3.0. Not only is it twice the capacity of the Dell drive that they &#34;sell&#34; for use in this machine, it is also just as fast even though it is an external drive. My ATTO and CrystalMark tests show a data transfer rate of 105 MB/s. Some of my 7200 RPM external 2TB USB 3.0 drives don't run any faster than the WD Ultra drive. However, it does add 8 oz to my total computer/battery weight that is already heavier than the 4.15 lb that Dell advertises because of the 91 Wh battery inside.  Update 4/16/2015:  I have had a Dell M3800 for 13 months. I use it for high-end structural engineering MathCAD modeling as well as professional-level Photoshop image development. I have never abused the unit, but it has traveled with me to several international locations and worked really well until the last trip. The M3800 decided it would not come out of hibernation. I had closed the lid many times, and it always came right back to life when I opened the lid...but not that time.  I tried all combinations of power button pushes and lid openings to no avail. Finally, the unit started beeping...eight beeps followed by a pause then eight more beeps, etc. It stayed that way for four days while on the ship...keeping me from getting my work done.  When I got home, the M3800 suddenly decided to start working again. I was pleasantly surprised and assumed the failure had something to do with the ship I traveled on...until it happened again four weeks later. This time it did not recover.  The unit was just one month out of the one year warranty when it started to fail, but I initiated repair through Dell anyway. To make a long story short, Dell initially misdiagnosed the problem as a system board failure. When their contract repairman came to my office and replaced the system board, the problem was still there. The repairman came back a few days later with a new LCD screen/cover. That fixed the blank screen and beeping, but the unit would no longer charge when plugged into a power outlet. The Dell repairman came back a third time to fix the charging problem and replaced the system board again. That fixed the charging issue, but one fan no longer worked. The one that did continue to work made way more noise than both fans made before this failure.  A contract Dell repairman came to my office a fourth time to repair my M3800. He brought the repair parts Dell had ordered and shipped to him. The kit included two new fans, a heat sink as well as a new mother board and back cover. That repair finally worked and the computer now seems to work fine.  So during the past month my M3800 has had one LCD replaced and the system board replaced four times in order to get the M3800 to work properly.  The repairman said the unit probably overheated which caused the initial failure and he showed me how much heat comes out of the vent on the bottom and how close to the table the unit sits. When I reminded him that the system board had been replaced four times to correct the problem and none of them had had time to overheat before the failure was detected, he just smiled.  Just to be certain over heating is not a future issue, I ordered a fan pad from Amazon. That will add 1.6 lbs to my laptop bag...so I will be back to lugging the same weight I had with my old Lenovo that never failed.",

The power from the front of the computer is not really powered enough to attach hubs.  When I installed it my computer completely crashed as it would not accept this hub.  I had to call Dell and work with the tech rep for hours to get everything back working correctly.  This Dell rep explained so much to me by having USB hubs.  If using windows 7 professional it will not recognize a 2.0 USB hub without a driver.  Now I have a powered 2.0 USB hub and it works just fine.  It also has to do with your power management system for USB hubs.  To be fair to this device, I have a complex computer system in my house with many devices.  3 different printers, 4 different scanner types, a weather station, IPAD, IPods, portable Photo viewer, Snap Scanner to digitize all my paperwork, bills etc. and 3 external hard drives all requiring USB connections.  If I did not have all of these, I would imagine this work just fine.  The powered USB hub that I use and got from Amazon is a D-Link Hi-Speed USB 2.0 7-Port Powered Hub (DUB-H7).

The hangups got more frequent, several times per day. I got a new Motorola SB5101U modem today, got it connected and it seems to work fine now. In the reviews here, I see other people have similar problems, especially related to Comcast. Time Warner bought the network here from Comcast several years ago, so I wonder if this is still this\\\\\" Comcast compatibility\\\\\" issue? As suggested by some users, I went to Dlink site to download \\\\\"Comcast version\\\\\" of the firmware. Well, there is NO firmware whatsoever available on their site. Looks like this product is unsupported by them anymore...    Update: looking at the FAQ for the Motorola modem, I think I understand why there is no longer any firmware update for Dlink modem:  \\\\\"Any and all firmware upgrades to your Motorola cable modem, or any DOCSIS cable modem, is completely under the control of the cable operator.  Motorola does not, nor is capable of, controlling the firmware upgrade process.\\\\\" - this seems to apply not only Motorola, but also any DOCSIS modem, including Dlink. So, the problem could be with Time Warner not loading correct firmware into my Dlink modem. It could also be that the modem just started malfunctioning. I guess I'll never know.",

I find it strange that I haven't seen any reviews in this site mentioning this problem.   In my case the problem is not only that the monitor won\u00b4t come out of sleep mode: worse than that, it would enter sleep mode EVEN WHILE I WAS TYPING. I was using the HDMI - DVI adpater that came with the Mac Mini, plus a DVI cable I bought at Best Buy. I tried with three different monitors, one from LG, one from Dell and the other from HP, with the same result. Sometimes I could work for hours without any problem, but sometimes the monitor would go black in my face three or four times in ten minutes.  I live in Brasil, and I bought the Mac Mini in the US, so I have no warranty. I ordered a mini Display Port to VGA adapter from Apple in Brazil, to see if it would solve the problem. Well, it didn\u00b4t. I changed the setting to make the monitor enter sleep mode after a few minutes (I had changed it to \\\\\"never\\\\\"), let the monitor go into sleep and couldn\u00b4t make it wake up again. I had to access the computer via VNC from my iPhone, turn it off and then turn it on again to be able to use it again.  I\u00b4ve been using the VGA adapter since yesterday, and at least until now the monitor has never entered sleep mode while I was working. I don\u00b4t know if it will stay this way, because, as I said above, the problem is intermittent. As it is now, I\u00b4m using the VGA adapter and I configured the computer to never put the monitor in sleep mode. It is not ideal, but I can live with that.  The Mac Mini has a good price and the design is very nice. I\u00b4m new to Mac OS and the track pad, and it has been fun working with them. But I think this issue with the monitors is serious. And it has been happening for some time, and Apple apparently doesn\u00b4t care. I\u00b4ve been working in the IT sector of a company with more than a thousand employees for several years, and in all this time I have never known of a computer that wasn\u00b4t able to present images in a monitor.

After 6 months I noticed wireless Internet access dropping despite maintaining connection to Trendnet router.  Of course I could not determine which router was at fault.  My office computer then failed with a direct connection to the TrendNet router.  Ironically, the wireless connection still worked.  This indicated to me that the TrendNet was failing.  I updated the firmware and tried for several more months, but dropouts continued which required power recycles of the TrendNet router to correct.  I have taken the router out of service and replaced it with a MoCA wireless extender form ActionTech.  Much faster and much stronger signal. Unfortunately this extender has a 16 device capacity that seems to push my STB's out of the network occasionally.",

It's like another world of computing. It surfs, e-mails, plays videos without even a hiccup, stores over 3,000 of my photos by category, has apps for everything at a fraction of the price of Microsoft, you can buy the open office for 8 dollars most apps I use are free. Others cost one or two dollars. I have a zaggfolio which turns it into a laptop with a wireless Bluetooth keyboard.<br />  Now along comes windows 8, which looks just like my iPad. If you want a keyboard, which costs 129.99 plus tax, which you need because it does not have a virtual keyboard like my iPad. Now of that 64 gig the OS requires 1/2 the space for it to function. so all that is left is 32 gigs, keep in mind if you add a app that takes space. Your storage will be in the \\\\\"cloud\\\\\" which you pay for. I collect data like people would collect books. So I have 6 TB of data stored on misc hard drives and I am about to buy a 3 TB hard drive to eliminate the misc hard drives. This all video, no music. Music takes up minimal space maybe 1/2 of a GB. Windows 8 is touch screen which in my opinion they stole the  concepts from apple like Bill gates stole the concepts of windows from Macintosh. The only thing they have is a sd port to increase storage, and a USB port. Big whoop since my iPad has Bluetooth capability. Due yourself a favor and look at iPad 2 not 3. Because you get more bang for your buck that way. I am sure there is a desktop version But the heavier the OS the more ram and video memory you need to drive it. Windows 8 laptops are touchscreen like my iPad2. Just a few thoughts.",

Which is sad, because they used to have solid devices.   <br /> <br />My 256MB model was constructed of metal with a permanent clear plastic housing that really gave it a solid feel.  Most importantly, the loop through which you attach a key chain was also metal and molded into the device itself.   <br /> <br />With the 1GB model, they removed the permanent plastic housing in favor of a removable rubberized sleeve.  Not an improvement to be sure, but it worked okay until the rubber sleeves lost their grip and slid off, to be lost forever.  The key chain loop was also plastic and fused onto the metal body.   <br /> <br />The 2GB model has lost even more sturdiness.  There is no longer a cap -- the USB socket retracts into the device.  This can be good or bad depending on your viewpoint.  The good is that you no longer have a cap to lose (never a problem for me anyway).  The bad is that there is no cap to protect the USB socket from dirt and dust accumulation from sitting in pockets and such.   <br /> <br />Unlike the previous models, this one is completely plastic and feels very cheaply made.  The key chain loop is a flimsy little metal ring attached to one end -- one good tug and your USB drive will be quickly separated from the rest of your key chain and lost.  I went so far as to remove it altogether and replace it with a sturdier ring. <br /> <br />I don't see the retractable design as an improvement, frankly.  In fact, it adds to the overall length of the device, since it must now house the USB socket and the mechanism to retract it.  It is easily 10% longer than my previous models.   <br /> <br />Finally, I removed the U3 software because I had no use for it.  I just wanted a backup storage device to shuttle files between computers in different locations (work, school, home).  Sandisk should have offered the U3 software as an option that the user installs themselves if so desired, rather than forcing it upon us.   <br /> <br />I had trouble removing the U3 software as well, and had to call Sandisk technical support.  I must admit they answered fairly quickly and walked me through the proper uninstall procedure.  Apparently my problem was that I have a USB hub attached to my PC (doesn't everyone?), which confuses the device and makes it difficult to uninstall the U3 software.  Another bad oversight by Sandisk.  <br /> <br />The device works fine now, and seems fairly speedy.  But I don't think I'll be buying any more flimsy plastic USB drives in the future.  Better off spending a little extra and getting a solid build like the Titanium drive (also from Sandisk).",

Thinner than the original Versuvu but still added quite some heft to the iPad since it's so light. There's also a tiny gap between the front cover and where the iPad sits but the elastic band holds the right side of the front and back together pretty well.

I found myself lowering one side of the headset and placing it above my ear so I would have one free ear.<br /><br />The second complaint is it is extremely uncomfortable.  The only way you will find any comfort is if you place it entirely over your ears in one exact position and never move it.  The speakers only move up and down, and don't have any kind of &#34;joint&#34; movement, so it's very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Third complaint is it broke within two weeks of use.  The microphone just stopped picking up any sound.  I took the headset apart to see if a wire was loose, and all of the wires are very poorly installed.  I honestly didn't even bother trying to fix it.<br /><br />I would suggest getting one of the headsets that has a one ear speaker.  Much more comfortable, and actually cheaper some places than these type of headsets.  I feel like the only reason this headset exists is because it &#34;Looks&#34; like one of the high quality headsets that have in-game sounds.

I purchased directly from El Gato rather than going through Amazon.<br /><br />There are two VERY important items listed in the description which contradict each other and will make many Playstation 3 owners unhappy.<br /><br />The first item...<br />* Input: Xbox 360 (unencrypted HDMI), PlayStation 3 (A/V In)<br /><br />Note the \\\\\"PlayStation 3 (A/V In)\\\\\". This means the Playstation will not work with an HDMI connection. That's right... the HDMI out port on your PS3 will be rendered useless with this device. The GameCapture ONLY WORKS WITH THE PLAYSTATION RF OUT. What does this mean? Well, for starters, no 3D at all. No 3D games, no 3D Blu-Ray viewing. Because those features only work via the Playstation's high-speed HDMI out port. So, if you connect the GameCapture \\\\\"inline\\\\\" as it's designed to be and your'e told to... you actually cripple the output from the Playstation. The HDMI 3D and high speed output of the Playstation is one major reason many purchase the Playstation to begin with. El Gato ruins that completely with the Game Capture connection limitation.<br /><br />The second description item to be aware of....<br />* Output: HDMI (pass-through)<br /><br />\\\\\"Pass-through\\\\\" indicates you can plug in HDMI cables on both ends of the GameCapture device and the HDMI signal simply passes through the device. Note this is ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE for the Playstation. You will get absolutely NO PICTURE if you attempt to use the Playstation's HDMI out port with the GameCapture. El Gato states this is due to \\\\\"DHCP copy protection issues\\\\\". Fine, whatever reason, it should be made ABUNDANTLY CLEAR that the device does not allow full operation of the Playstation if connected in line. It's annoying to spend the money, wait for the device, find out about limitations only when it arrives, then wait for a refund. If they simply mentioned the limitations with the Playstation on the web site, my purchase would havenever been made. But I'd guess they are hoping many Playstation 3 users are merely using the RF output from the PS3 and won't even notice how crippling this device can be to a Playstation.<br /><br />If you want to use the GameCapture device AND get 3D features from a Playstation, you'll need to connect the PS3 HDMI out to your TV or receiver, then connect the PS3's RF out to the GameCapture and then the GameCapture to a different input on the TV or receiver. Then, you'll need to swap the PS3 video output signal whenever you switch as well as any input signals on TVs or receivers. Did anyone at El Gato actually try all this? What a nightmare.<br /><br />This may be a great device for Xbox owners. However, for Playstation 3 owners this thing basically takes all the high end video output features of your Playstation and makes them pointless. Of course, if you're simply outputting the Playstation 3 via the RF connector already, you won't notice all the limitations. But if you've got HDMI possibilities, you really want to dump the RF output and switch to the HDMI output.<br /><br />For PS3 owners, this thing MAY be worth $50. It is absolutely NOT worth $200 though.",

The rj45 connection works fine; however I didn't buy this netbook for hardline connection.  I need to use it on the go and all around the house!  I will probably be returning this product.",

The headset works great when you plug it in but when bluetooth is used, anytime a voice application is used, sound from applications other than the voice applications either lose all sound traveling via bluetooth or it is severely degraded. Furthermore, the bluetooth goes nowhere near 30ft. There is stuttering beyond 10 feet. We have verified that it is a problem with the adapter. I am not happy about this and will be contacting the seller soon. I only give 2 stars because it works at all. I will not improve my review until the issue is fixed or I am refunded.",

I have used Invisible Shield on my MacBook Pro and the fit and finish is way superior than this product.  Well, I did not pay Invisible Shield price for this either, so you do get what you paid for.  Waiting for the product to dry and the adhesive at the edge is loosing tackiness already.  I would not buy from the same company cause I have a feeling that eventually I will peel this off for Invisible Shield or a full case.  Hope this helps.",
