Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times. Father: Yeah. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Rule number two: You always must wear your seat belt and obey the rules of the road. Daughter: Duh. I wasn't born yesterday. Father: Okay, rule number three: You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road. But driving to the movie theater is fine. Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier. Daughter: Hey, having the car keys in my hands changes my whole perspective on life. Father: Well, okay. I guess if I'm considered the best dad in the world for five minutes, then I'll accept that.

I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.

As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right? M: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful.

Interviewer: Oh, I think I can do that. What else? Alex: When drinking or eating something outside, you should keep the garbage until you find a trashcan to put it in because littering makes our planet dirty. Do you like seeing trash all over the ground? Interviewer: No, I don't. Do you have any final suggestions? Alex: Yes. We shouldn't waste paper because trees are being cut down to make the paper.

W: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes. M: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition? W: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me. M: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability? W: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors. M: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting. W: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey. M: Are there any other advantages do you find? W: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that. Of course, this makes me quite a slow reader., Question: What unusual ability does the woman have?",

She became internationally known. My father was a lawyer. And though it's hard to say how much they influenced me, I liked them, I respected them and I'm sure I was influenced to some degree by them.

I started out thinking I'd be an economist, and then I got disappointed with that. And after an odd experience in my junior year, I decided that I'd go out and study agriculture or management, but I enrolled in both for a whole year and tried to learn the required courses. I lasted a year, and then I came back to the main campus and finished up as an economics major specializing in labor economics. W: Did you go right graduate school or join the army after you graduated from the university?
