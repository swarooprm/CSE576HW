    "Definition": "This task is to classify and tell the relation between the second sentence of the input and the first sentence of the input. If the second sentence has a similar meaning to that of the first sentence then the output is ' B_entails_A', if the second sentence has the opposite meaning to the first sentence then it is classified as ' B_contradicts_A' otherwise the label is ' B_neutral_A' ",

            "output": "B_contradicts_A",
            "explanation": "The sentence B has opposite meaning as sentence_B says, \"No man with a hat\", but sentence_A says, \"A man is wearing a hat\", so B is contradicting A."
