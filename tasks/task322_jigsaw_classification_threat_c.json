For example, under the new rules if a farmer wants to pass their farm down to a child, it will incur either a 56% or 71% tax on that transfer, but they could sell the farm to a foreign owner and only pay 26%. How is that fair? \n\nYet a bank CEO can still sell their millions in stock options at 26%. If they are truly trying to target \"the rich\", then the rules should apply across the board. \n\nMost smart business owners have money kept in their businesses in case of a downturn to be able to pay the wages of their employees, taxes, benefits, and utilities. If that money is invested, it is already taxed at the top marginal rate of 53%. The new rules would now equal 65%+ tax on that money.\n\nWhen a business earns income they pay a small tax rate on that initial income. When it is paid out as salary or a dividend, more tax is paid at that person's marginal tax rate, and it falls in line with the current tax guidelines.",

South Africa’s rating is 45.”\nSo, in other words, it was standard practice up to now\n“SAP has instituted formal disciplinary proceedings, in accordance with South African labour law, against three employees who were placed on administrative leave at the beginning of the investigation. SAP has been clear from the outset that it will not tolerate misconduct or wrongdoing.”\nWhat were the rules before the Board decided to eliminate sales commissions? Maybe the three employees acted within the rules at the time – scapegoats? I’d like to hear their side of the story!",

Aside from oil, there is little Alberta has other than tourism and real estate that could be the foundation of balanced trade with Asia. The NDP may think it can make viable export businesses happen but the record on such efforts is little short of dismal. Inviting what Chinese capital is available to establish operations in Alberta may create a few jobs but the accompanying concessions will make them very expensive for taxpayers. In the meantime, trainloads of Chinese manufactured cheap consumer goods will keep rolling in.

Whidbey Environmental Action Network has watched as time-after-time developers have gotten variances and waivers and exceptions allowing butchering or outright removal of Oaks. A classic example: a development design by a Seattle architect that never even visited the site and the presence of Oaks was a \"surprise\" for which the developer got a variance. The dawn massacre of the post office Oak was not an exception.  \n\nThank you Garry Oak Society. May I suggest that you partner with the high school Ecology Club and map the remaining Oaks in the City? Send a copy to the City and developers will no longer be able to claim \"ignorance\" of the presence of Oaks. As for this particular situation, reasonable use may not be granted if the situation was caused by the person trying to make the claim. See OHMC 20.12.060(4)(d).",

A recent septic-tank hole in a major stream bottom showed thick charcoal layers from major fires in about every two feet of sediment, as deep as the backhoe dug. Some naturalists are saying that most wildfires shouldn't be fought, but allowed to burn through the fuels. I don't know whether that would work politically, since so many people live in fire-prone areas or are affected by smoke, as we all are today.\n\nI previously noted that firefighters should not be placed downwind of a large flame front.",

You'd think the hotel kitchen staff would be constantly walking into and out of the freezer to retrieve frozen items or put items in it to freeze.\nWas it an auxiliary freezer?\nWith what is presented in the article, I don't think there is anything wrong with the police telling the mother not to worry, the daughter will show up. I bet 90% of the time, that's what happens.\nThis 19-year-old got drunk, got separated from her friends or got dumped by them, walked into the walk-in freezer and, sheer speculation, either collapsed from being drunk or, if the freezer closed after her, was too foggy to figure out a way to release the latch.\nI've been in a walk-in refrigerator once. It was in a church kitchen with someone else, and they kept the refrigerator door open so I could fetch something. Do walk-in refrigerators or freezers have safety latches like fire doors do?",

Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.\n2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.\n3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).  So they would have to switch to higher property taxes which the sales tax supporters would probably consider even less fair.\n\nIf you just gotta have a sales tax, make it a big one only in the summer season.",

Even illegal aliens who work and get any tax benefits use an ITIN number and pay taxes! When you have a child who dies because they were not able to get any health care, perhaps you would temper your criticism a little. Do you have a job, insurance, vacation and sick pay? Congress was exempt because federal employees do have employer sponsored health insurance, same as any other employer offered plans, not because they specifically exempted themselves. Insurance companies are big business, no doubt. But for the plan to work, it needs participation. Everybody else is picking up the slack of those who will not participate to make insurance affordable for ALL!",

Thus if we knew that information, we would become nothing more than whatever God would have us be rather than individuals of free will who choose to love God, which is in fact what He wants us to be, therefore causing a worse paradox. God made us perfectly, knowing the outcomes, but gave us the choice. If we choose hell instead of God, the only criticism we have left is to ask why He bothered creating us at all?

Catholic universities and corporations founded by no-longer-functioning religious congregations almost universally were offering normal commercial insurance plans -- which cover all these reproductive services -- before Obama and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  \nWhy?  Because they have to compete in the employee market for acceptable licensed practitioners like everyone else in their industries.   Their employees are not all Catholic--nowhere near it and they want normal commercial insurance benefits.  These institutions are hospitals & universities, public corporations much like any others.  They'll charge you every bit as much for that procedure as they will your atheist buddy at work.  It's a business.\n\nProof:  Think of the 2 biggest & most prestigious Catholic universities in the US?  Did they close their doors?  Do you really think they will over this?",

Government policies (not just regulations and laws, i.e. ESA) have lead to the virtual cessation of logging on these forests.  It is indeed a testament to the \"industry\" that innovation and modernization  in both production and products has been able to  maintain as many jobs as there are given that the raw material supplies have been reduced to a fraction of what it used to be and what the potential is.

Why would any machine even allow  multiple votes by the same person in the first place?  Anyone know? Seems like just one more way voter fraud can take place.",

Right now, I'd say Pax has the most trade value but we have the luxury of keeping both to further develop and raise their market value if we choose to, no need to trade either for peanuts. Whoever is left becomes the BU and when their contract ends in 3yrs, then we see who wants to stay as BU and who wants to try to start elsewhere.

CPI-median is higher, at 1.6%, and this was actually the highest of any of the core measures published by the central bank. It is ironic that within a year prior to the 2016 renewal of the inflation-control agreement deposed CPIX measure as the operational guide, the CPIX inflation rate had been as high as 2.2%, much higher than any of the three new measures. Now in April it is at 1.1%, lower than any of them! Oddly, one of the reasons for that is its greatest strength: it is the only core measure that excludes mortgage interest cost. Its annual inflation rate was -1.5% in April 2016 but in April 2017 it finally rose to 0.0%. No other central bank in the entire world has a preferred core inflation measure that is sensitive to mortgage interest rates; Morneau and Poloz should be ashamed of themselves that the Bank of Canada now does so.",

Either remove the double taxation from all or make the REIT’s pay. This is especially troubling for the state of Hawaii where so much money is derived from real estate. The council on revenues has come up short on projections of late and bewildered why. Well, when Alexander and Baldwin no longer files state income taxes for 2017 and beyond, at least they will know why...

The complaint that the prosecutor badgered him is odd, as that's what defense attorneys and prosecutors do. If the defense didn’t badger Mr. Campbell about his credentials (are you sure about that?) it was likely a strategic move, as his resume was impressive & it would have appeared that they were grasping at straws. There were many other data points during the seven 35-hour weeks of the trial of that were just as significant (some more so) than the testimony of Dr. Babrauskas and Mr. Campbell.

The principle of religious freedom means a lot to me, as it's one of the hallmarks of the enlightenment and liberal values, and it really pains me to see so many people who call themselves \"progressive\" appear so willing to hem that in.

The same people who believe the dividend has created an entitlement state tend to earn the highest incomes in the state's best jobs and vocally oppose the idea of a statewide income tax. Instead they Pick, Click, Give away their dividends for a much needed tax deduction and they won't miss the money either way. The PFD comprises a much more significant portion of income to Alaska's less affluent families and local businesses, where this year's garnishment will be felt the most.\"\nhttp://www.anchoragepress.com/opinion/new-world-alaska",

I remember pulling my arms and sometimes my face into my t-shirt to pass through a thicket, or doing a wide sweep with my leg to stomp them down. The stalks are hollow, so it's very easy to do, even for a kid. Then in fall, when the stalks dry and harden, we would sword fight with them.",

When the northern ice melts, shipping wants to travel through the north west passage, but because the melt is not uniform, the presence of more shipping in those northern waters requires ice breakers to rescue ships when the wind shifts, and ice pans blow into the new shipping lanes threatening the vessels there.  As for cutting everything but SAR, that just indicates that you don't know what else the Coast Guard does.  Good luck getting your groceries shipped in if the Coast Guard wasn't out there installing and maintaining aids to navigation.  They also inspect and certify vessels for regulatory compliance (safety) and do fisheries patrols to keep out foreign fishing fleets from our waters.  Coast Guard really is the one military service without much fat to cut.",

And yes, we will \"kill's em all\"...because trust me, they want to kill US all.  I guess you don't support our (underline our) new Pres.?  I'm not so sure from the tenor of your comments ;-}  Let me clarify the US from above...I mean the ones who want to kill us all, take jizya, or behead us, or make us convert; not all of them.  Shameful how the Dems didn't even recognize the wife of the Chief Owens!  Shameful.  Did you notice his wife?  SHE knew what the dealio was.  Why can't you?",

If the people are paying the state to cover healthcare, then they will not need to pay insurance companies, which they are currently doing. So all that's happening is, instead of people paying their premiums to the insurance company then the insurance pays the provider, people will pay the government and the government will pay the provider. It's if Anchorage started providing internet to residents. It would cost more in taxes, but probably less than we are currently paying GCI or whoever. People are already paying, it will just be to the state instead of insurance companies, who take extra profit.",

As far as smoke goes, when there's fire, there's smoke, so regardless of where the sprinklers are located, smoke is inevitable.  The common area is an issue but not the \"BIG\" issue.

Both systems are setup so that you can't have the most populous regions of the country completely dominate elections by giving a bit more say to rural areas.  Hillary lost because she could not win enough states with a plurality of electors.  If she ran up the totals in New York and California but still lost then the system is working as designed.  She needs to win more than just the big states and she didn't win enough of those.  Questions about the electoral collage are foolish.

In violation of Army regulations, Michael Flynn was on RT's payroll and concealed his Russian income while he was being vetted to become Trump's national security advisor. A national security advisor who worked for a Russian propaganda network that collaborated with a hostile intelligence service was no problem for Trump. After being briefed by Sally Yates (whom he quickly fired) about Flynn's lies to Pence, Trump withheld that knowledge from Pence for 17 days, revealing his collusion with Flynn only when Pence learned about the lies in the Washington Post.",

If CAPP's first prediction of 4.83 Mb/d is reached, there will be a 2.67 Mb/d or more of excess capacity. With the recently approved Kinder Morgan and Line 3, the capacity will reach around 4,982 Mb/d, which would be more than sufficient to carry all the crude produced in Western Canada until at least 2030.

From what I can gather from recent media coverage of the drought, the weather patterns have also had an adverse effect on rainfall. These two factors, coupled with the unavoidable amount of time needed to plan and build new dams and reservoirs has created the 'perfect storm'. However, there is room for improvement and I'm sure Patricia is aware of the challenges and is formulating emergency measures to prevent a disaster. The ANC has no room to talk - 21 years after they took over we were still having rolling blackouts.",

A solution that appears to work better, as measured by the abortion rate, is to give that woman Hope, by providing free kindergarten, buttressing the Earned Income Tax Credit, and showing that woman that by our country's investing in innovation, there will be a job out there for her kid. Not to make this a political argument, but it is under Democratic presidents (Obama) that the abortion rate fell to its lowest level ever.

Let's do a little simple political math, shall we? At any given time, there may be 20-30,000 people looking for homes in the GTA. I'm being generous here, and basing this on the number of homes actually sold, which is considerably less than that each month. Now compare that with the number of home-owners in the GTA, who are happily watching the value of their biggest investment going up, and who will not be happy to see the party stop. Those homeowners number in the hundreds of thousands, at the very least, but likely in the millions. Now which group do you suppose the Liberals would rather keep happy, if they are rational?\nI don't know the situation in Vancouver. I'd guess that there is far more demand there for the number of homes in existence, because Vancouver is hemmed in between mountains and the sea. Toronto is a different situation entirely.",

He was surely over the top, but I don't think cruelty, punishment, or abuse was his intent. In the world of sports this attitude has been the standard forever, and can be effective for people that want this type of training. But it is definitely to intense for this level. He definitely should have stopped when requested. But to charge this man with abuse based on this video isn't necessary. He knows he went where he didn't intend to go-Causing harm.
