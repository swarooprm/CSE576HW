So now we are both in college together and enjoying it a ton. But now it's getting close to the end of her(supposed to be) senior year at the high school. Which means prom is also coming up. \n\nNow, I don't know about all of you but I think prom is one of the most elaborate scams ever devised by the education system and entertainment (case in point: every high school sweetheart film ever made). Which is why I never went to my senior prom.\n\nIts overpriced, you REQUIRE a nice outfit, and to top it off neither of us go to the school anymore. I've given her all these points and yet she still wants to go. We did, however, go to the homecoming last year. Let me tell you, I've never been more disappointed with my school and you have gym teachers getting arrested for sexual conduct with students here. \n\nShe was upset about the homecoming being bad too and I just know that prom going to be exactly the same way because there is no way our school makes enough money for a proper dance. So what do all think? Am I wrong for not wanting to go to a dance with my her? I'd rather spend the night at somewhere that would actually be fun. Perhaps a nightly beach walk or something.",

            "input": "My best friend is getting married in May and itâ€™s been the plan all along that her bachelorette would be a weekend away in April. I have helped her plan parts of the trip and was completely on board until this past weekend when she sent me the detailed itinerary of the plans. Iâ€™ve been busy these past few weeks and I know sheâ€™s been working with ironing out the details with another one of her bridesmaids. \n\nSo the new details I learned this weekend that are making me want to back out were:\n\n1. Weâ€™re going away for two nights, not one. I have a full time job and a three year old. My husband is extremely hands on with our son and is totally capable of and will be happy to take care of him for two nights by himself. But Iâ€™ve never spent a night away from our son and I am not sure I want to do it now. I think itâ€™s a lot to ask of my husband. Especially because my friend, as much as I love her, is not the most sacrificing by nature and would never do things that donâ€™t fit into her normal life/routine for me. So I donâ€™t want to go out of my way for her. \n\n2. There are going to be 15 people there, none of who I am super fond of or have anything in common with. Iâ€™ve met them a few times over the last 3-4 years and while they were okay to have a brief chat with over dinner, spending 2 days with them seems like A LOT to handle. I initially thought itâ€™ll be just the bridesmaids so like 4-5 of us. \n\n3. They have plans to go clubbing one of the nights and I just donâ€™t do that. Probably the only person in the group who doesnâ€™t. I donâ€™t drink and going clubbing with 15 people with who I have nothing in common just sounds quite unpleasant. \n\n4. Iâ€™m pregnant and will be 4-months along in April. This adds to the whole not wanting to go clubbing and on long hikes (I havenâ€™t gone hiking in 3+ years) with a large group of women that Iâ€™m not friends with. Hiking features a lot in the planned itinerary. \n\n5. Itâ€™s going to be pricey and Iâ€™m not comfortable spending a huge amount of money on a weekend that I know I wouldnâ€™t enjoy. I would actually be happier giving that money to my friend as an add-on to her wedding gift. \n\nSo how selfish am I being? My plan is to offer that instead of driving there on Friday night, I can drive up there on Saturday and be there for a photoshoot, lunch, hangout and dinner that she has planned and then drive back home. They have a few things planned for Sunday that Iâ€™ll miss but Iâ€™m okay with that. ",

            "input": "My partner of 7 years feels that I don't do enough cooking/washing. I feel the opposite. I work fulltime and cover 100% of our bills as well as providing a small amount of pocket money for them (personally I consider all our assets/income to belong to us equally but they didn't feel comfortable pooling all our money into a joint account). Dates and such things are split. During school terms they work two six hour shifts a week. On those nights I get home about an hour before them and will usually cook. Cooking and dishes on the weekend are split or done by me. They do most of the laundry and vacuuming (I still do some but maybe 1/5th as much). I do the 'heavy' cleaning jobs they don't want to do (wiping down the bathroom, cleaning the toilet, clearing drains etc).\n\nSince it is easier for me to carry, grocery shopping is either done by me on my way home or together on the weekends. If we need one or two ingredients on a night my partner works they will sometimes grab it but never any full shopping loads because it becomes too much to carry.\n\nAnything technical or clerical is done by me. Household repairs, organising our rent, banking, doctors appointments, government documents, taxes, computers etc. I have a phobia of sorts to talking on the phone but I do most of our phone calls because my partner will put it off indefinitely. In their defence, English is their second language so they are nervous to talk in English (their English is absolutely fine though, they have lived in an English speaking country since their last year of High School and completed Uni in English).\n\nA year and a half ago when I was still looking for full-time work I used to do more of the chores so it was closer to a 50-50 split. I can sympathise with them but since I am working fulltime and cover all of our bills I feel that it is reasonable that I would now be doing less chores during the week.

In the 18 years Iâ€™ve spent living with him heâ€™s never congratulated me on anything or told me heâ€™s proud of me and heâ€™s always telling me he may die before I ever impress him.

I usually have to end up staying up late to finish my homework because of this. While the training is annoying the main reason I donâ€™t want him involved is because heâ€™ll take credit if I end up doing well just because he forced me to go to the gym. I told him that soccer is something very dear to me and that since heâ€™s never shown me love I donâ€™t want him to be involved in anyway. I donâ€™t want him helping me train and I donâ€™t want him at the games.

            "input": "This happened this weekend. My gf works at an accounting firm aa an accountant and sometimes has to work out of town for varied periods of time. This past week was one of those times, she has worked out of town for 2 weeks although she did pop in the previous weekend so we could attend a friend's wedding and have dinner/beers with the rest of my friends group who are usually out of town (they live all over now).\n\nFast forward to this weekend, I was invited Thursday night to this bbq that was happening at a new friend's house on Saturday afternoon. A little bit of backstory here, I was one for the few friends that stuck around in my hometown after high school (I'm 27) and I haven't gotten around to making new friends to hang out with so I appreciate any opportunity to make more. While this is happening, my gf let's me know she's coming in on Saturday, I tell her I can't pick her up since I was working that Saturday and she says it's fine, her dad can get her home and immediately after that, I invite her to said bbq because I was sensing this was gonna cause me issues and she just said she would consider but didn't think so.\n\nThen, on Saturday, my friend was getting ready for the cookout and told me to be there by around 3 PM. I go and then my gf texts me, asking what am I doing and around what time are we gonna see each other, I tell her I am at the bbq and if we could meet at 8 PM. No answer after my texts and I call her, she says she thinks she always loses to my friends (like I said, I don't have any) and that she was really excited to see me after being a whole week away, going off about how we barely got to see each other the previous weekend because we had to attend the wedding and  then go to dinner with my friends and how she feels if it came between her and my friends, I would've gone with then and if she hadn't gone to the dinner get together she wouldn't have seen me at all as I would've gone to dinner anyway (which is true, I never get to see this friend group so I take advantage of any opportunity).\n\nSo, while on the call (this took place around 5 pm), I try and defend myself, \"it's not true\", \"we can see each other in a bit, like I said, 8 pm\" but she was having none of it and repeating how she always loses to my friends, then says she has to go and we hang up. For what it's worth, we don't see each other for the rest of the day and after texting her a bit to angry responses and her telling me the day was off and we could see each other some other time, so I decide to salvage the day, stay and get wasted l, though that didn't stop me texting her.\n\nThe next day, I try and talk to her and she's making one word responses, so I notice she's punishing me, I insist and we meet up at the time she said. I get there, we go to the mall, get a coffee, I walk with her as she pays her bills, she's still mad but it's a start.\n\nAfter that, we get to her house, I say hi to her family and we talk. In short, she thinks I could do so much more, that she's not a priority to me, that my friends, or my recent acquaintances at that party, would obviously blow it off for their respective wives and gfs. I try to tell her that they're not in the same position and not desperate to get new friends like I am but I recognize it's a flimsy defense and I drop it, only telling her that I was super sorry. A little bit later, I go gone and she tells me again over WhatsApp, then blocks me. This has worried me a great deal so I feel forced to ask about another POV.\n\nSo, in short, AITA? Could I have done better? Is it just a TIFU? I feel I'm not completely in the wrong but I have no idea.\n\n\n\n\n",

Weâ€™re in high school, and have been considered Best Friendsâ„¢ï¸? for the entire time weâ€™ve known each other. This year, however, was different. \n\nNot only did she begin to literally ignore my existence, she would get mad at me when I was in a bad mood. Iâ€™ll admit, I get snappy when Iâ€™m angry or sad, but from knowing me all this time she knew that none of it was directed at her. Regardless, when Iâ€™d snap at her and immediately apologise, she didnâ€™t care and would storm off. She started doing drugs and fucking around with her boyfriend constantly,  and it got to the point where she didnâ€™t care about anything else. Kateâ€™s life was entirely drugs and sex and rock nâ€™ roll. Once she said â€œif I donâ€™t have my Juul Iâ€™m gonna have a sucky day,â€? and snapped at me that she â€œNEEDS her Juul to be happy,â€? to which I replied â€œthatâ€™s not good, Kate that means youâ€™re getting addicted to nicotine. Fucking stopâ€? and then ALL OF HER NEW FRIENDS ganged up on me, saying it was obvious Iâ€™d never Juuled before and making me feel terrible about myself. \n\nThrough those _Extracurricular Activities_ she became friends with a bunch of people I didnâ€™t have anything in common with. Iâ€™d still go sit with her and made an effort, even though I felt uncomfortable the entire time. It came to the point where she began to ignore me completely, like I said earlier. Iâ€™d say â€œhey Kate Iâ€™m going to class now,â€? and she wouldnâ€™t even acknowledge I was there. So I left. Then I stopped saying anything at all. \n\nI started hanging out with my other friends, and I stopped talking to Kate all the time. People would always ask me why I was friends with her if she made me feel so awful. I never knew how to answer. \n\nHer boyfriend, another friend, and I all planned for months a surprise birthday party for Kate, whichâ€”minus a few minor bumps in plansâ€” went well. There was cake, presents, and all the typical bday things. We did it because her mom is a bitch and never let her have a birthday party before. However, when we were out doing the thing we planned, she did nothing but complain and snap at people and sit in the corner whispering with her boyfriend. \n\nWe were also in a club together. It was Debate Club, and you had to pay dues to be in it. We were presenting a bill to be debatedâ€”one that I did literally all the work forâ€” and her only job was to do the opening speech. That was it, a minute long synopsis of our bill. So Iâ€™m walking to the room Debate Club is in, I can see the door a few feet ahead of me, and I get a phone call from Kate saying she doesnâ€™t have her club dues. â€œShould I go? I donâ€™t think I should go.â€? Finally, even though I was going to do horribly without her, I said she shouldnâ€™t come. I was just so done with how unreliable she was. She said thanks and hung up while I was mid-sentence. So I went in, tried to give the opening speech completely unprepared, and I did horribly (as expected). It was the worst public speech Iâ€™d ever given, which sucked because Iâ€™m normally extremely good at that. I burst into tears on stage and ran off. I literally couldnâ€™t do it anymore. Two days later, I hear sheâ€™s talking shit about me behind my back, telling people (MY FRIENDS) that I told her to â€œget the hell out of Debateâ€? and calling her an â€œunreliable bitchâ€? and all that jazz. \n\nSo I texted her. â€œHow dare you. How fucking dare you do all this shit  to me. Youâ€™ve been so mean and made me feel so mad about myself when all Iâ€™ve done is care about you.â€? And in the texts, I did say things that I donâ€™t regret but weâ€™re pretty damn meanâ€” â€œall you do is smoke, fuck, and feel bad for yourselfâ€? â€œyou step on other peopleâ€™s balls to make yours feel biggerâ€? â€œmanipulativeâ€? â€œunreliableâ€? etc. Then I blocked her number and that was that. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

The girl and myself are both 17. \n\nTL:DR at the bottom \n\n\nFor starters, weâ€™ve know each other since we got to High School. It was always a chill thing, never super close. \nTwo years ago, she had a on/off thing with my best friend in a grade up. They were always never certain on anything. That changed when he moved across country. I was closer to her then, but still just acquainted. \n\nLast year however, her and I started to talk a lot more. She was always super spotty with texting back, but she said she was really busy and I went along. Summer break hit and as I tried to make plans, sheâ€™d leave me on read/opened constantly. I began to think of it personally. \n\nWe stopped contact until the start of 1st semester this year. We had a class together, right after lunch. I like to get to my classes a bit early on the first day, scope out whoâ€™s sitting where and make sure I can sit near someone I know. Where I ended up sitting, there was an open space right beside me. She walks in right before class started, sits down beside me and just starts talking to me like nothing at all. \n\nOver the course of the semester, we were close again. She again was still super spotty with responding to me. When my best friend came back for a week, she changed completely however. She was immediately responding to me, asking to hangout, etc. I took it with good graces, thinking she was trying harder. It was like that for a couple weeks, then she dropped off again.\nRight before winter break, we went on a trial-date of sorts and it went really well. I mentioned how I have a discount at a high-end restaurant because of some connections, so we went there. \nWinter Break hit, and she said she was travelling. I didnâ€™t bother trying to talk to her as she said sheâ€™d have very little Wifi and such.\n\nShe comes back and we hangout a few times. She was always glued to her phone, never really paying any attention. I felt really bad about myself, thinking I did something wrong. \nWith 1st semester exams coming up, we didnâ€™t talk as much due to studying. I was ok with that, still thinking I had done something wrong. Exams came and passed. We have no semester 2 classes together and she stopped responding to me completely. \n\nFinally a couple days ago she texted me asking if we go back to the restaurant for another date. I responded, with no reply for hours. Finally I texted my best friend to message her and see if she was just ignoring me. She replied to him immediately. I had had enough at that point and snapped at her, saying she only talked to me if she needed something. She swore me off, saying that I should know she rarely checks her phone and told me to never even look at her again. \n\nAITA or did I over-react?\n\nTL:DR, girl I know from school was very spotty with me. We had a kinda thing but sheâ€™d only respond consistently every so often. I called her out and cut her out of my life. AITA?",

I asked her if it had anything to do with this guy from work, and got the \"you shouldn't worry about him\" talk in return. \n\n\n\n\nFast forward to this past weekend, I drove us down to San Diego just to hang out, which is give or take 2 hours away from our area. Everything had been going great all day, and we were waiting to order in a Denny's when she got all serious and dropped the absolute shocker of a lifetime. That guy wasn't just a friend, but she was *going to* cut him off after feeling super duper guilty, poor her. Iwas obviously still hurt, but mostly I was just pissed, so I stormed off, got in my car, and left her there.\n\n\n\n\nI pulled over a few miles away and she was blowing up my phone, apologizing, cussing me out, etc. In the middle of it all she did manage to tell me I had to come back and get her.

I gave thought to turning back, but eventually angrily texted her back to make her co-worker come get her.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways I still feel pretty shitty about the whole thing, in the moment I just couldn't fathom being in a car with her for hours listening to excuses.

This is a long story so I will have to give a lot of background...\n\nI (M21) have been with my girlfriend (F20) for over 2 years now and we have been long distance (LDR) for 1.5 years in college. It was a great relationship at first but things have really gone downhill since then. I believe it's been her mom.\n\nHer mom has always been suuuuper involved in our relationship. Like, she knew right away when we had sex for the first time, knows every single date we go on, and knows every argument we've been in. That last one is the main point of this post.\n\nMy girlfriend tells her mom everything. I find the \"my mom is my best friend\" thing a bit much but I can live with that. But it's gotten to the point of telling her to not give me attention, ignore me, not ask me what's wrong, and saying stuff like schools first and things of that sort. I know that's her mom telling her to say that stuff because she wasn't like this before.\n\nWe haven't had sex in a long time because she thinks that's all I want, when it never used to be like that. Her mom also says she \"just wants her to be happy\" but that's a way for her to want to know everything and tell her what to do. Her mom thinks she's right about everything and I hate that attitude. \n\nIt has gotten to the point where I can't express my emotions because then it comes out as me \"not being confident\" or \"having trust issues\" when all I want is more communication in our LDR and more affection. Her mom is completely controlling her emotions and her life and it's taking a huge toll on me. I don't feel like I can keep this relationship going. \n\n**My girlfriend has specifically said she SENDS her mom texts before she sends them to me for APPROVAL. Is it just me or is this weird?! I'm close with my parents but would never ever do that.\n\nFor the record, I am not needy or clingy. All I ask her for is a 15 minute phone call every 2-3 days when we're away and that's apparently too much even though we barely communicate over text. I know her mom is telling her to say \"schools first\" because she's used that BS line on me before. So manipulative and controlling.\n\nShould a mom have that big of an influence on her daughter's relationship, even though she's in her twenties? I think this is a case of extreme helicopter parenting but I want to hear everyone's opinion.\n\n*I'm missing a lot of details but this is the rough summary*\n\nAITA for wanting to break up with my girlfriend because her mom is making me feel like I'm suffocating in this relationship??

I was excited and I said yes immediately and was looking forward to our future together. \n\nAbout 2 months later I notice that she's becoming increasingly stressed for seemingly no reason. I worry a lot about her because she has been diagnosed bipolar in the past and though she was pretty much fine in the last 2 years I was worried it was resurfacing. She was also having a lot of trouble with some of the people I considered my friends at the time who were pushing her away and trying to create space between me and her which was driving her crazy (as they were supposed to be her friends as well). \n\nI was obviously sympathetic to her as I cared about her a lot and wanted to make sure my girlfriend now-fiance was doing okay. So I tried to help her out, encouraged her to meet people and make friends as I figured that would be healthy for her. I suggested therapy and possibly medication as it appeared the Bipolar symptoms were re-surfacing but she refused that for a time as she didn't want to go back on meds.\n\nA little more time goes on, it's now apparent that bi-polar is really kicking in and she began telling me things like \"I don't know if I can even feel love right now\". During this time she has become increasingly close to one our co-workers (we all worked in the same place.) At first to me it's fine, I think it's good for her to have her own friends. As time goes on they spend increasing amounts of time together while spending a less than average amount of time with me. After a bit I outright ask if there is any feelings or anything I should be worried about there and she denies it completely insisting that it's nothing.\n\nPass a little more time, he comes into work with a hickey on his neck and I pretty much knew something was up. My friends (unknowingly to me) invite this guy to a party, get him drunk and ask about the hickey horrified to figure out that it was from my Fiance at the time. They let me know, I let her know I know, and then interestingly she breaks it off with both me and the other guy (though they are still friends) and comes to me to apologize.\n\nThis is where it gets complicated. She came to me apologizing and crying about what had happened. How it was the worst mistake in her life and she regrets everything that she did. She tells me she doesn't know what to do without me in her life and she doesn't want to lose me. And honestly, I think she was sincere, and I don't think she would do this again.\n\nHowever that was about 6 months ago. Since then me and her have been in a sort limbo. After about a month I began telling her that I do care about her and want whats best for her and things could be worked out with a lot of talking and time. She was telling me she doesn't know what she wants  or whats healthy for her, or if she was even in the right mental state to make a decision like that. She told me that I might have to be okay with just being friends with her and not necessarily expect a relationship. Over time being told this over and over again, though I offered her support and advised her to see professional help I began drifting away from her slowly.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after not having seen much of any progress at all being made, I told her I was ready to move on. It was hard because we both still cared about each other but it seemed apparent that  nothing was about to change. I left that day, and then she turned around the next morning now confident that she wanted to try to patch things up with me.\n\nTo me it's just feels like it's been a little too long and too late.\n\nTLDR: Fiance cheated, she apologized, I told her we could patch things up then 6 months later when she was ready I had moved on.\n\nAm I the asshole for saying we could patch things up then switching when she was ready?

Now, I'm not super confrontational, but I was upset so I called A to talk to her about what B told me and immediately denied it, saying she would never hurt me or betray my trust like that, then she states he must have figured it out himself because I don't look very straight. She was adamant that B was lying, but when I pointed out B didn't have any reason to lie and she started crying, \"how can you not believe me?\" I got really uncomfortable so I offered to talk to her about this a different time when she'd calmed down but she seemed even more offended by this saying she didn't need me to coddle her feelings. Okay, that's fine, but as the conversation progressed she got so emotional I ended up hanging up. I called her the day after to talk about it, and she was determined that B had lied, and that she was upset that I didn't believe her. She said it so forcefully I started to believe her but after pondering it for a bit I decided I wasn't entirely sure if I did believe her and that's where the tables turned. She started screaming about how we were \"basically best friends\" and \"how can you believe him over me?\" In the end I backed down and said I believed her even though I didn't.

At one point she talked to my girlfriend for over 30 minutes and I just avoided them both for that period.

My girlfriend said that I was being rude and immature by going so out of my way to avoid A, but I genuinely had no interest in ever talking to her again once I found out what kind of person she was, but a couple of other people seem to agree what I did was petty.

We were pretty tight and he knows probably more scarring secrets about me than any other person on the planet. He came from an abusive home life where was homeschooled, had information like his SS card and birth certificate hidden and withheld, his dad held him emotionally captive, and his step mom was verbally and physically abusive. Prior to moving in with me, he stayed in the adjacent house belonging to his dead grandmother, with no plumbing or electric. He's from way up north.\n\nA few years into our friendship we resolved that when I got my own apartment in my current town, the stars aligned; it wasn't instant, but I moved him down here, much further south. I helped him get his paperwork in order to get the documents necessary for job hunting.\n\nDisclaimer: I've never lived with a roommate outside of family and one year of college. It does not suit me, I do not like it, and I appreciate my privacy. I've not been in a relationship for more than a decade. I'm 27 now. He knows all of this.\n\nI moved him in anyway, out of a brotherhood and deep friendship. We'd never actually met face to face, so I cautiously added him as an additional occupant rather than another party to the lease. This protected me, but it also gave him the benefit of ignoring rent aside from just paying it to me.\n\nWhen he moved he didn't have a job; it took four months. I paid for those first four months, rent and food and utilities for the both of us. I also helped him get his job, just a mere ten minute walk away (he can't drive). I'm not trying to get points. I'd never ask for repayment, but I feel it's important for the ensuing events.\n\nWe agreed he would simply pay half rent, no utilities, and could help with the groceries later. In exchange he did the lion's share of the chores and cooked (something no one wants me to do). Rent went up $25 and I just didn't bother making adjustments. Utilities only amounted to about $150 all told, so I ate the costs.\n\nChores: He washed the dishes because without him there wouldn't be a mess to wash, and he was paying less for exactly this purpose. When he moved in there was a flea problem as well as a roach problem, so he was also vacuuming every day. As the fleas got under control, he vacuumed once or twice a week, and then stopped entirely. The roaches also got under control, and then he got lax about doing the dishes and leaving trash in his room (both things I explicitly discussed with him long before he moved in). We did the laundry as needed, and I take care of all cat related chores and costs (I have two).\n\nAll was fine until he started seeing this girl. He'd started getting lax already, but when they started talking it really went downhill. He grew increasingly distant and would chat with me briefly and then lock himself in his room for hours talking to her every night. Before I said something about the volume he never even shut his door.\n\nFirst she constantly wanted me to text her as well, and chat, and we'd all be friends. That's just not my personality, nothing against her. Then I'd be going out the door to work and she'd be meeting me at the door to come in. Then she'd be there when I got home. This happened a couple of times before I set some boundaries. I said some stuff about not wanting her to be here all the time. I have a tone problem I've been told. One day they weren't here so I texted to see if they were coming home with a lighthearted joke about being able to strip down and do whatever if they weren't, which apparently made her uncomfortable (even though I didn't text her) because I'd been so cold leading up to all of this. Then they got here and my roommate made her stand outside in 30 degree weather under the assumption I didn't want her inside at all, which I clarified was not the case. He came to get her things, but when I told him they could come the fuck inside because of course, it's freezing, they went into his room, shut the door, and stayed there for 4 or 5 hours until about 1AM. I worked the next day, and it's a small apartment.\n\nSo I clarified my rules.\n\nThey were simple rules, maybe a bit strict. Basically it was just \"be mindful of my schedule, don't have her here for ages if I'm going to be home, and don't have sex on the cats (a real rule I added to express what I thought was the levity of the situation...and also I didn't want to clean splooge off of my cats)\". These were never respected to any real degree. She just ended up being here one specific day a week (a work day for me, so I got to come home to it) until about 1AM each time. I never said anything about it directly, but my frustration probably showed.\n\n*Then* things got a little more tense, about a month later. I was sick one day, and he made dinner shortly after I woke up in the evening. The evening before was her usual evening, and they were together the whole time locked in his room until the usual time. While I was preparing to eat, unshowered and looking a mess, he lightly and happily added that she was also on her way over because she wanted some of his tortellini. Well I lost my cool, snapped, and told him that it was inconsiderate and I was going to go take a shower. He didn't understand *why* I thought it was inconsiderate, and neither did I. He told me I didn't have to get ready or anything just because she was coming over. I disagreed. I later realized the reason I was upset was because he never even thought to ask; he just invited her. He doesn't need my permission, but that had just been our relationship up to that point. The jury was still out on whether I thought any of that was fair.\n\nAnyway I sulked in my room, and didn't speak to anyone (pretty much no different than any other time they were here except I wasn't sulking). Finally he opens the door and tells me she wants to talk. I don't want to talk, and tell him as much. He repeats his statement, I say \"[Roommate], I don't want to talk to [GF] right now\". I need time to think through my emotions, or I say things I don't mean or haven't processed fully. A few seconds later she barges into my hallway adjacent to his room and starts going off about how I have a problem and we're going to discuss it. I just continued sitting at the computer, looking away from her and doing my thing while she rambled on, getting frustrated. Occasionally I'd reiterate that I didn't want to talk right now. Didn't matter.\n\nEventually she gets me to crack and I spout off a laundry list of problems I have, largest of them being the slacking off of chores (in private I also explained to my roommate that when I'm here I'd rather they be playing Smash Bros. together in the living room than locked in his room fucking, or taking showers together). As I listed off my problems she'd give me a sassy \"mhm?\" and repeated this about 7 or 8 times. Finally I stopped complaining and simply said that \"her sassy 'mhm's?' weren't doing her any favors and the longer she went on the less I wanted her here at all\". That ended the conversation, and later she apparently cried. I was fully prepared to not speak to my roommate until after my pre-planned vacation, but he was amenable the next night, and we talked it out. He also talked it out with her, and it didn't go as smoothly behind closed doors. Full disclosure, I 100% eavesdropped on the conversation against my better judgement.\n\nAll I asked him to do was watch my cats while I was gone for the week. They were free to stay here and do whatever. I also found this an appropriate time to raise his rent from $400 to $500. I didn't do this solely as a punishment, though; I did it in exchange for doing *all* the chores. I would clean, wash dishes, and deal with the miscellany on top of what I already did. He told me he thought he should *only* pay half. So I calculated it for him.\n\nThings went on pretty much the same after I got back, except I never saw his GF again. Period. It went back to talking on the phone, except this time much earlier, and for much longer. He pretty much stopped cooking or doing anything outside of his room. Then he told me he was moving out, last week. He had applied for a job and had an interview; if he got it he was going to move out. I didn't realize the urgency in all this when he said it. I literally did not see him again after he told me he had the job. He stayed over at her place for several days, did a few more interviews...and then I got an email from my property manager saying he'd removed himself from the lease. An hour later he texted me and told me he wanted to give a proper goodbye but \"needed to get early rates on the apartment\" as if he couldn't move his stuff after signing the lease, and had moved all of his stuff out; he can't drive, so he just wasn't going to go to his last few shifts for his old job. The only job he's ever had. He had to pay the security deposit so he had to split his payments. He'd already paid me half earlier in the month before he mentioned anything, and then paid $150 with the breakup text he sent me. Conveniently he only paid $400 the one month he'd been asked to pay more. And like that he was gone. He asked me to hold his mail.\n\nWe exchanged some words after this all settled in, and, well, frankly ESH for the texts. Basically I just wanted more time; he'd needed a month if he was on the lease! That's after the fact, though. It hurts having to suddenly make up for $400 a month I didn't have to worry about, and it hurts that he basically did all of this behind my back. Mostly I just feel betrayed, but I'm not sure how at fault I am for the way this has all played out. My parents, friends, and coworkers are of course biased and they don't want to read 10,000 character",

            "input": "TL;DR: Told two coworkers to stop chatting within earshot of their team members, got told off for â€œpublic shaming.â€? AITA?\n\nFor context, my work environment is VERY busy and fast-paced. People work towards very stressful deadlines, and if youâ€™re contributing as you should, there is almost zero downtime. This day, I had a very intense workload, as did the 5-person team I supervise. We were all stressed.\n\nEnter two coworkers, Iâ€™ll call them Rima and Lucy. Both are women in their mid-20s. I am not their supervisor, but was well-within earshot of them, as we have one of those terrible open office spaces. Their supervisor was leaving in two weeks and very much checked-out. \n\nRima (who has put in her notice) and Lucy, are  junior, hourly employees who have been chatting nonstop for about an hour. I know itâ€™s not work related based on some words I pick up. For several minutes, I wait for their supervisor or another senior employee on their team to intervene, but none of them do. Most of the managers at my company are young, and many of them are very non-confrontational. Iâ€™m getting increasingly frustrated.\n\nI use the internal chat system to message a senior staff member in their row who ignores me. At one point, I go to the kitchen to get a snack, and another junior employee on their team complains to me that he canâ€™t do his work because of the talking. \n\nAt that point, I go up to them in their row and say: â€œguys, the chatting has to stop. This is a common working environment.â€? They have guilty looks on their faces and stop talking, and I go back to my work. I told them off within earshot of their row, but with a normal speaking voice. Ie. Not excessively loudly. \n\nThe next day, I find out that Rima complained to the department manager, feeling like she was disrespected because she was â€œpublicly shamed.â€? The manager tells me off about it, and tells me I should have brought them into another room and talked to them privately. I apologize for creating a situation my manager had to deal with, but told her I was on fundamental disagreement with her point of view.  \n\nMy opinion is that the burden of expectations should be on staff to act professionally, not for managers to disrupt their work flow to walk on eggshells around disrespectful employees. Besides, pulling them into a separate room would have been just as conspicuous given the office layout. \n\nI was certain I was in the right but when I vented about it privately to a friend of mine in the office also told me I was in the wrong. His opinion also bothers me, as he told me that I should have â€œused the opportunity to act as a female mentor to young women instead of berate them.â€? I find this attitude to be paternalistic (shouldnâ€™t women my age be expected to be as professional as everyone else?), and puts an extra expectation of emotional labor on me, who already has a team to manage. I also have an odd sense that there is a gender dimension to this as I frequently tell the male members of the tech team to lower their voices when theyâ€™re talking about memes, but nobody has ever taken issue with that. \n\nAITA? \n\n\n",

This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.\n\nOne  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn't doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.\n\nSimply put, M comes in every day, and after he's done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.\n\nWith  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, \"Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they'd BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.\"\n\nFrustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I'm sick of M speaking to me like he's my boss, and that he  shouldn't really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn't have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, \"It's not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron's just being helpful so you'll just have to learn  to ignore him.\" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.\n\nWithin this statement,  there's the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don't fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they're meant to slide down.\n\nSo  Long Story short, I think M should be asked not to return to the store. AITA?",

A few months or so ago, I'm scrolling through social media when I see they post that they're at a party. They're being very loud, and they're jumping up and down to music, something that is totally out of character for them. They were always the quiet type, especially when I saw them at school around other people.\n\nI send them a text saying \"Looks like fun haha\", a couple hours later they reply with gibberish. I ask what they said and they just reply \"I'm so drunk\", and a picture of alcohol on a table. All I reply is \"that's probably not the smartest thing you could have done.\" \n\nThe next morning they ask what I meant. I just said that them getting drunk, especially at their age (16), isn't the smartest thing you could do. Automatically they got defensive, saying they had a good time and that they were with friends. They said that the alcohol let them unwind and have a good time.\n\nI reply saying that it's good they had a good time, but alcohol shouldn't be the reason you had fun, and that they did something that they wouldn't do normally while sober. We basically went back and forth for an hour or so, them justifying it because they had fun, and me just saying it wasn't a smart thing.\n\nMultiple times throughout the argument, they'd say \"can we just ignore this\", but then they would try to get the last word in, usually along the lines of \"I'm still going to drink I don't care what you say,\" to which I'd respond to and start the argument again. It then evolved to them telling me that I was taking the easy way through life by going to college. Eventually, I had enough, and said that we should apologize to each other, and they said they had nothing to apologize for. I left it at that, and it's been months since we last spoke.\n\nI never, throughout that entire conversation, say \"you should not, or can not drink.\" All I said was \"it wasn't a smart thing to do\". It was simply just advice. I don't care if people drink, but it was just a mixture of their age as well as how they acted that worried me. They were with friends and they didn't drive home, and they assured me that they'd only drink around people they knew.\n\nWas I out of line? I felt it wasn't really my business, and I sort of knew this person was stubborn, so telling them anything would probably not be effective anyways. I knew they weren't going to say \"You know, you're right\", but I figured it wouldn't hurt to just say something. ",

She's relying on these scores to get into med school, which she considers the only option as far as her future goes. She has been studying day and night for these exams for months, and while she's rightfully nervous, some of the stuff she's been saying is just rubbing me the wrong way. She took the first test yesterday, her math exam, and has been crying ever since she got home from it, saying she's going to feel guilty for the rest of her life.

We have an attic which we keep a bunch of random stuff in. \n\nOccasionally Ill need something from the attic, and I end finding a bunch of other old stuff. About a year ago I found an old tin with my pokemon cards in it.  They were all curled and dusty from age so they were all worthless. After finding them though, I started to get back into collecting them. \n\nI dont have that huge of a collection now but I do have a few nice cards that Ive pulled that I keep in binders in my attic. (My parents didnt really know I was collecting again before the incidents)\n\nSome days of the week my elementary school aged cousin comes to our house after school to wait for his mom to get off work (shes a nurse). My parents went through the attic to find any of my old art supplies they could find for him to keep himself busy.\n\nThen though, they started pulling out my binders of cards to show and probably give him. I got kind of lucky and walked downstairs immediately after he opened the first binder to look and I just said something along the lines of â€œJust remember, please only look at them and donâ€™t take anyâ€?. And he said okay and that was that. It was just me and him in the room. \n\nAbout a week later my mom knocked on my door and asked if my cousin could have my cards. I said he can look at them but I really dont want to give them to him. We bickered so we just made a deal that I would give him a couple of them. We went through them together and I gave him some cards that I had duplicates of that he wanted, and I actually probably gave him about 60 different cards. So you know, a decent amount to an elementary schooler. Again, all was fine. This happened in the early summer of 2018. \n\nAlso, I told my mom later why I didnt want to give them away. \n\nLast week, my cousin came and knocked on my door and asked if he could have my cards or if â€œI still liked themâ€?. I apologized and said that I did still like them, and he said okay. I learned later that he came down the stairs dissapointed. Ever since then my family seem to be annoyed with me.  I asked my mom about it and she said that nobody could understand why I wouldnt just give the cards to him, and I explained to her that I had spent money I earned at my job on many of the cards and I actually use (trade / sell / play) them, and they probably would just sit on his shelf. \n\n\nTLDR; my elementary age cousin wants PokÃ©mon cards that I bought and my family is annoyed at me because I dont want to give them to him. \n\n\nSo AITA? I understand he is only a kid and also part of my family, and I honestly do feel kind of guilty by not giving them to him.  But I bought them with my own money. I was never mean about it to him or anyone. ",

TL;DR at the end\n\nFirst, my son, who is 16, got a part time job over this last summer. He raised enough so he can get the family gifts for Christmas and a ps4 for himself. I couldn't buy him one since all my money goes to my parents for personal and financial reasons. We both live with my parents and it's not out of being super poor, but it's comfortable and my parents are very chill.\n\nI work basically a 9 to 5 job, but backwards. 9 to 5... Night shift. So it's hard not to be very not aligned with my family in terms of being awake.\n\nRecently, my son has been doing... Below average in school. I, being a single father, worry about this. My parents spoil my son a bit too much to not care about his grades. They usually throw the \"you should focus more\" line to my son which just goes right by him.\n\nOne day, before work, I see what my son is up to and... It's his PS4. He is on it. I haven't noticed much of him playing it until I saw his report card right after mid terms and Christmas break happened. When I saw him I told him that he needs to study more and that the ps4 is making him do less work in school. He tells me not to worry. Me, being stressed a bit before work, snap a little. His grades haven't been doing too well and that I wanted to see his grades on the spot (they have the grades online and I trust him to show me when I ask). But, he hesitated a bit. He said he may have low grades because he still needs to turn some stuff in.\n\nI'm a bit angry at this point. I know I shouldn't have but it didn't change the fact he had low grades. He finally showed me and there was an F! A big ol F in Chemistry. It's a hard class I know but, an F! A lot went through my head. Why haven't I been notified by the teacher he's doing this bad?? How come he hasn't asked for help? I always tell him to ask me for anything. Then I asked myself. Is it because he's playing games all the time???\n\nI told him that he needed to give me that PS4 on e spot. We argued a bit. He paid for the ps4 but I paid for his school. I had to head off to work and didn't finish the argument, but the next day while he was at school I took the ps4.\n\nHe was angry at me for the first time in his life. Saying that he worked hard for that ps4. I told him about his grades and he said he needed to turn stuff in still. I told him he shouldn't be late in the first place. \n\nThis was only about a week ago. And he still has an F in Chemistry\n\nI told my parents I did this and they said I needed to go easier on him but I disagree.\n\nI told my son I'd give it back once he gets his grades up. But he DID pay for this ps4. It's his. And I took it.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR my son had a summer job, paid for his own PS4, but I took it away recently because his grades haven't been doing well at all (Failing a class).",

Since he moved in, i havenâ€™t talked to my dad and i have been arguing with my mom every.single.day. It has been a nightmare.\nThe problem is that this big, fat, 34 year old, thinks (just like every other north african migrant, except for people from Lybia and Egypt) that Italy is the place to be, when it is NOT; my parents paid for his tuition in Morocco, and he did not finish studying for his college degree. Then they bought him a scooter to help him get a job, (again, he was still in Morocco) and he didnâ€™t find one and had to sell it; they paid for his marriage (he also had a daughter), while he lived in our house in Marrakech for all of his adult life without paying us a single euro for the rent, or the bills.\nHe has always been completely dependent on my parents, and this thing always drove me insane, because i cannot forget what my dad went through when he came to Italy as an immigrant 30 years ago... he slept in the woods, on trains, he didnâ€™t eat for days on end, he was robbed, he was discriminated, he had to go through some Tough shit, and here is this shrek-looking giant baby that comes to italy with an easy jet flight (paid by my parents), and thinks he can conquer the world by watching the tv and eating all day long.\nAnd what bugs me the most is that both of my parents dont think there is something wrong with them spending money on his future (and not mine, wtf, we are not rich), or with him not helping with the chores (even though he doesnt work and is at home doing nothing all day long).\nWell, do you guys think i am the asshole for not talking to my uncle and my dad (we had a terrible fight about this situation) and for deciding to eat alone in my room until he leaves our home?\n(I am an 18 year old girl, next year i will be studying either medicine or biology, university life is expensive, and my parents wont be able to afford sustaining my studies, our family and his family forever)\nFun fact: since he has moved in, iâ€™ve never even saw him. I shower when he is sleeping or outside, and i cook when he is another room or out, lol. I have no idea how i am managing all of this shit, but it is driving me insane, INSANE\nSorry for the text block, i just enjoyed reddit and i donâ€™t know how to edit.",

It's clear as day that no one likes Ashley. She is very rude, to not only Sam, but to me, our other friends we all hang out with, and just everyone around her. She is a total bitch IMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere Sam goes, she's there. When we decide to have a \"Guys\" night, she tags along. When she does, she's nothing but selfish, rude and talking constant shit while always touching and totally showing PDA. The PDA is the worst part. Sam is always paying for her food, meals, giving her rides to school then work. For context, Sam isn't the most...Fortunate man in the world. He's not poor, but nowhere near rich. He's about almost at low class citizen area. SHE comes from a very rich family. Has a million dollar house, lives in the best city, has cars from a Tesla Model X, to a Mercedes S-Class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, he's totally submissive to her and does whatever she wants. Sam is giving it his all for Ashley and she is literally just saying, \"Meh. Pay for my food.\" Sam is currently balancing 2 jobs and high school while Ashley doesn't even have one. The relationship is totally lopsided and it's clear as day that Sam is whipped. There was a time where Ashley slept in the same bed as one of her cousin's friends at her house. And she claimed nothing happened. And of course, Sam believed her and laughed it off. He's even bought her a $200 necklace she has never worn before. Which was about 2 paychecks for him. She bought him a hat. He wears the shit out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't even tell her parents until there 1 year anniversary, which was sketchy as hell in my opinion. He will go out literally every weekend to her house at 1am to go spend the night at her house to avoid her parents. Keep in mind they live about 30 minutes away. And he is always going over to her house. She's been to his house once and that was a few months ago. Sam moved about a month later and she hasn't even seen it yet. She is a terrible girlfriend and it's clear as day she is whipped, so WIBTA if I tell him he's whipped? Providing all the information and proof that says so. Or should I just keep my mouth shut and let him find out the hard way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Best friend is clearly whipped due to the influx of things he does for his girl, pays for every meal, drives out to her house every weekend which is a 30 min drive away, buys her expensive jewelry, she's a freeloader and yet she's extremely rich. He is pretty low class. She has been suspected of even cheating (which she probably has.) Our whole group hates her and thinks the same of her. Should I tell him he's whipped or just let him find out the hard way?",

While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.",

We met online, and it wasn't until college that we started phone/videocalling, and started dating. \n\nWe've had a myriad of issues and been on again/off again for the past two years, but a big conflict has been his parents. Partially, this was due to how they talked about me -- it was super long distance, so I never talked to them, but his mom literally sat him down and told him she was afraid I was going to be his \"foreign wife\" (apparently a bible reference, saying that I was going to ruin his faith, as I am in fact very white and American). But the biggest part of it was that in the beginning of the relationship, I was extremely blunt about my thoughts on how he was raised. Specifically, I stated that I believed that any parents who were complicit in the abuse of their child were themselves child abusers. (His sister was mentally and physically abusive, and taking up too many parental resources, so they sent him to a private school, which was admittedly expensive and amazing EXCEPT for the person who started mentally and physically abusing the boys. He told me himself that they had proof, and their concerns were brushed off/they were not believed. He was eventually believed and pulled out.)\n\n\nAs you can imagine, this did not go over well. Most people do not want to hear that their SO thinks their parents are child abusers, especially if they are still in denial about having PTSD (he has now accepted that and went to therapy for several months). \n\nAfter being in therapy myself (this was my seventh attempt at therapy, after a run of bizarre bad luck where I had many who gave me a) AA prayer b) advice to be a Wiccan and have lots of BDSM sex with strangers and c) a single breathing technique before throwing up their hands and giving up), my therapist and I decided that my approval of his parents shouldn't really matter. My new mantra was going to be that as long as *he* thought they did their best, that was what mattered. However, we didn't see any obligation on my part to actively agree with the idea that people in close contact to children -- e.g. parents or faculty at a boarding school --, have no obligation to protect those children from abuse. \n\nWe are 20/21. He still lives with his parents, and I live with mine on my school breaks. He does not have an order of protection against his sister because his parents guilted him against extending the temporary one he was granted. \n\nTLDR: By my definition, his parents are child abusers. Telling him that is obviously not the best course of action, but I refuse to outright voice approval that I don't mean. AITA?\n",

Today has been no exception.\n\nStarting at 5:30am, our 1yo wakes and is crying. I get up to help and wife asks that I just try to soothe rather than bring to her for early feeding. I do this, but baby begins to scream again. I thought wife says to bring baby to her and she will feed, but I guess I misheard her. She gets mad and says that I'm messing up the sleep training. I'm hurt by her frustration, but just lay back down.\n\nAnother moment from today: \nFamily is getting dressed and ready to go out for the day. I put on t-shirt I received for Christmas and an old baseball hat. Wife looks at me funny in disapproving way. While in another room, I hear her say in a gameshow voice, \"the whole family gets dressed nice and you decided to wear stupid shirt that says boats &amp; hoes and that awful baseball hat\". I ask if she was planning on taking family pics while out, she says no. I tell her I'll change since she disapproves, and she says don't... I tell her she's being passive aggressive and she says she's just joking and where the hell has my sense of humor gone?\n\nAnother instance: \nI'm speaking with her quietly in bathroom. She says, shhhh! The baby is sleeping. Ok, fine, but I was already taking quietly for that reason.\nA few moments later she shuts a cabinet and it makes a loud squeak and slam. I say shhhh to her as well. She then calls me passive aggressive and says I obviously had an issue with her telling me to be quite earlier, but that she didn't want the baby to wake.\nI agree and say that nobody likes to be shhh'd, but also agree that nobody like to wake the baby even more.\nFrom there the situation spirals and the specific details are blurry, but I'm told that I'm miserable, unhappy, need to figure out what my deal is, to get a life and find my happiness. I have been accused by her multiple times that I must really hate her and the life we have created.\nShe then decides that we need to split for the day, taking the kids out on our planned outings and for \"me to do me\" and figure my shit out.\n\nShe is out with the kids now and I am confused. I know that I am not innocent, as it takes two. And yes, I'm in kind of a funk right now. But it also feels like she is taking shots at me, perhaps out of irritation that I'm not 100% my chipper self. \nFunny thing is, I really believe that the things she accuses me of are some of the shortcomings and character defects that she possesses herself. If I try to communicate that to her, the whole conversation usually gets turned around to how I am guilty of all the things I tried to discuss with her. It feels like a vicious cycle of just going tit for tat over trivial points and arguing for the sake of arguing. And I hate it. It really makes me sad...\n\nNot sure if this is the right forum for this, but the feedback here seems to be good, offering great perspective.\n\nSo am I the asshole here, do I need to pull my head out of my own ass, or is there something else perhaps?",

It had been assigned for almost a month at that point, and the due date was literally a day away. Normally I'd love to help, but at that time I was busy with homework of my own, and I generally didn't want to replan my schedule. Now I told him that I really didn't want to, and to ask others if they could do it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while of him asking, I agreed to do it, but on the condition that his group would pay me for the editing work, much like if they had hired an editor. I receive the files later that day, and I begin to work. Now keep in mind, this project was due the next day, I had a physical limitation of 14 hours to finish IF I stayed up all night. After a lot of complications, I finally get it done with the help of another friend, and I call this guy's group to give it to them. I ask my co editor if he wanted anything, but he just said he was fine and went to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point it was almost 3 in the morning, and I had been working on the edit for a total of 5 hours or so. I tell them the thing's finished and ask for $50. They refuse and argue about why the price is so high. I didn't really think this was that high of a price, as I had spend many hours on it, and delayed my own homework to rush it out on time. After some more arguing, I just wanted everything to be over. I had school the next day and the most I was gonna get then was 5 hours of sleep. In the end I just told them to take the video, but if they could pay me that'd be really nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few months to my birthday. This was still a while ago, and I hadn't gotten any of the money from any of the people. I didn't want to make a big deal out of my birthday, I just changed my mood message and mentioned it if anyone asked. Generally for other people's birthdays, if I didn't know them well enough for a personal gift, I'd just give them $10 worth of gift cards in something like steam or amazon. Some of my friends knew I played this game alot, and gifted me some skins and premium currency. I was pretty content with how things turned out. The friend I edited for didn't get my anything but I wasn't really caught up on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day at school, I see him at one of my classes. He sort of pulls me to the side and hands me a $10 bill. When I asked him what it was for he replied that he was paying back the money he owed me for the editing (there were 5 people in that group, they split the cost evenly, I still hadn't gotten the other $40). I feel like it would've almost been better if he didn't get me anything at all. Paying me for a job I did as a birthday gift just kind of feels wrong, and I don't really want to get him a gift again this year for his birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking this way?",

She treat me terribly but I can't help feeling guilty for how fast I moved on it made me feel like such an ass especially after all my old friends had said their piece, one said how she treated me doesn't justify getting into a new relationship that fast after four whole years. My girlfriend has assured me it's just more of her manipulation but if so I have to admit its worked. AITA??",

He asks that we take back the one we gave him and deliver a different one. Problem is, we usually donâ€™t give away free furniture in the first place, and having to go wrap it up, bring it back, and deliver a new one is expensive, not to mention that we cannot sell his table as a new item.

No point me doing it when I canâ€™t do it as well as her!\nThis is a throwaway because my partner knows my reddit username after I showed them an r/aww post.\nAnyway, this is kind of an ongoing issue I (21M) have with my (23F) girlfriend. \n\n\nThe issue is this, we both work full-time (I work more though with 40+ whilst SO only has 35) so the house I moved in with her 7 months ago (A cozy flat we rent) can sometimes get reaaaally messy. I work as a shift manager whilst my SO works as a cleaner for a small business. Since she works as a cleaner, I mainly assumed that SHE would do most, if not all of the cleaning. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m not sexist! Itâ€™s just because sheâ€™s good at it, not because sheâ€™s a woman.\n\n\nAnyway, a couple of weeks ago, the house starts getting worse, as though she has stopped cleaning. Normally, my partner will put my work clothes through the wash and dry, iron and fold them on my dresser so that I can just get up at 8am to leave for work easily. The first time it happened, my clothes were left on the floor, unwashed and not ironed. I was pissed, but I put them on and went to work (th whole time I felt self conscious and embarrassed). I felt humiliated so I came home and waited for her to finish work. We argued and she said she was sick of having to do all of the cleaning and washing. I tell her itâ€™s been like this since we moved in and that she was being an asshole about it, especially by randomly not washing my clothes, making me feel shitty the whole day. It ended with her crying and bolting the bathroom door shut. I had to stay up for a few hours to calm her down.\n\n\nEver since, Iâ€™ve had to start cleaning shit up and im beginning to get mad that she wonâ€™t tidy shit up anymore. Sheâ€™s GOOD at it, and even earned a raise for how well clients were rating her service. It pissed me off that she expected me to now do all my own laundry and wash my plate after she cooked. Iâ€™ve never been good at it, and my mom always scolded the fact I could never clean up as well as her.\n\n\nI posted this finally because Iâ€™m debating bringing this up with her. Itâ€™s inconsiderate of her to leave everything to me after Iâ€™ve been at work all day. I may even mention that if she carries on, I will move back to my moms house so that I can be relaxed after a really long day at work.i donâ€™t think that Iâ€™m an asshole and my mom agreed she should be doing more than she is right now.\n\nAITA??\n",

Except I didnâ€™t want to have the conversation over text and she always seemed to be busy and running to hang out with her bf or ex or whatever.

I didnâ€™t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couplesâ€™ leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career.

I had messaged him earlier this year saying that he could visit me the week of the the 24th , but it seems like he came to Nyc early . This is my finals week and my job has lots of intense days so Iâ€™ve been putting in lots of work both inside and outside of the classroom. When I got his text I responded that we could meet up for a few hours as I have work to do. He agreed and met me at my apt at 7:30pm.\n\nThe context was clear : we both were interested in having sex with each other . It had been 4+ years since weâ€™ve seen each other but weâ€™ve been in contact every now and then we would be in contact hence why I told him he could visit me the week of the 24th.\n\nSo we hang out a bit , have sex and cuddle for a little. I start putting my clothes on so that I could get some work done . I ask him what his next move was and he told me he was just going to stay with me. I was shocked because I had not planned for him to stay over and very much wanted my space to study in peace for my finals and just be in my own space alone. The Sex was great but I love alone time and I was very much craving that after he fucked the shit out of me. I expressed this to him and he responded, â€œI wonâ€™t get in your way, Iâ€™m just going to be chillin here â€œ\nMe: â€œno, but that is in my way. I wasnâ€™t expecting you to sleep over because you didnâ€™t tell me you wereâ€?\n\nHim : â€œwell, I donâ€™t have anywhere else to goâ€?\n\nMe: â€œI thought your frat brothers were in the city ? If you needed to sleep over why didnâ€™t you tell me in advance ? I would have arranged for us to meet at another time when I didnâ€™t have so much work to do. I was about to cook for myself , take a shower, study and do my own thingâ€?\n\nHim: â€œI didnâ€™t expect to be here this late , and now that I am , I was just going to stay here. I wonâ€™t be in your way â€œ\n\nMe: â€œyes, but I was not expecting you to stay here ...Iâ€™m waking up early and am working late ...â€?\n  \nHim: â€œI can also wake up early , have no where else to goâ€?\n\nSo I let him stay over but I was very annoyed . I stayed up extra late and left all the lights on in my room in hopes that he would eventually figure it out and leave. I listened to class recordings and tried so hard to be a nuance because I very much wanted to be alone. I cooked for myself and did not offer him any food , as I had not gone shopping because, again, I was not expecting him . Itâ€™s bad enough that I have roommates that I feel crowd my space , but now this guy was literally all up in my space . \n\nI was finally ready to go to bed. Heâ€™s 6â€™2â€? ex football player so heâ€™s taking up most of my full size bed . When I get in, he tries to cuddle with me but I actually donâ€™t like cuddling . I had my alarm go off at 5am to get him out early so I could at least enjoy some sleep alone in my bed . When the alarm went off I told him it was time for him to go. He responded , â€œIâ€™ll leave when you leave â€œ  but thatâ€™s not what I wanted ! I wanted him out of my bed . I tell him I have yoga at 6 and want to get ready. He says ok , gets ready and head out.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to be by myself after coitus? For trying to put him out even when he expressed he had no where else to go?

We went on several fun dates and chatted daily about our interests, kinks, life goals, the whole shebang. I was feeling really comfortable and safe with Wallace and after some negotiating we agreed to a sleepover at his place and to have our first sexy times (woohoo!). \n\nHowever, that's where my excitement ended.. When I got to his place I found it to be dark, dirty, empty walls and gross furniture, mattress on the floor, etc. It looked like a college apartment. Then, he introduced me to his dog, a rescue dog who is extremely nervous. I'm not blaming the dog at all, but from the second I walked in the door she wouldn't stop barking at me, and she is a big dog, also acting like she was nipping at my hands. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without her barking continuously outside the door. I was getting uncomfortable at this point, but we retired to his room and I thought, \"Ok! Rough start, but let's have a good fun sexy time!\" I wanted to be in the moment and enjoy getting to explore this person's body for the first time, but that dog barked literally every second we were having sex. The whole time non-stop. We make dinner, to dog barking at me. We went on a walk, the dog barked at me, we came back and started to wind down to go to bed but the dog wouldn't sleep unless it was in the room with us and she kept coming up to me in the night and just staring at me and if I moved she'd start barking and growling. I felt paralyzed. I realized at about 4 am that I was having a panic attack because I felt trapped, I couldn't move or leave without the dog barking more and I was exhausted and stressed. I stayed just frozen in panic for hours. eventually Wallace moved, looked over and realizing I was awake asked if I was ok. I felt like the interaction unfroze me suddenly and I just stammered I had to leave, that I had a nice time with him but that I had to go immediately and I quickly got up and gathered my things and left. \n\nSince that incident, I just don't find Wallace attractive to me. It was like a lightswitch and I've never had that happen before. Am I the asshole for just flat out losing interest in him because of this? I feel like I built of so much hope and interest in our future and now that is all just gone on my end. I communicated with him that I was no longer interested, and he's really hurt and blindsided but honestly so am I? I really liked him and the feeling is just.... gone suddenly. \n\nTLDR; I was happy and excited about a new relationship with someone, but I lost interest after seeing how he lived and after his dog wouldn't stop barking at me.",

            "input": "So me and my BF started dated around the same time as my sister and her BF fast forward a year and a half, and my sister gets engaged. I think 1.5 years is too soon to get married, but her BF is military and my sister hangs out with a more church-y crowd, so that's normal, I guess. \n\nMy sister's entire life seems to have evolved around her wedding. Since we were kids she's been picking out colors, venues, themes, watching God knows how many episodes of Say Yes to the Dress and Four Weddings etc.. It's a super big deal for her. She wants to have the Pinterest Perfect wedding of her dreams. Not my cup of tea, but I can see how it would be important for other people.\n\nWhile I've always had fun with the idea of a wedding, in the end I'm very anti-social, I'd rather use the money for an awesome honeymoon or a down payment, and I don't think it's worth the hassle. Since my sister's engagement my mom has teasingly asked me about a wedding in my future. I expressed to her that I didn't expect it in the near future, and that me and BF have agreed that eloping is probably the way to go, as the money, for us, is better spent elsewhere.\n\nA few days later my sister excitedly texts me to tell me the amount my parents had pledged toward the wedding. She was excited because in person they told her it would only be a few thousand, but that day sat down with her and gave her a new number... twice the amount they initially told her. \n\nI was suspicious so I asked my mom about it to which she merely shrugged her shoulders and made some grunting noises. Obviously this left me somewhat upset. Throughout my childhood my parents have implied that they had money set aside for weddings for both of us. And I don't want to imply that I need or deserve that money, but it's only fair that my sister and I get a fair amount. \n\nJust because my sister wants a blow-out wedding and I don't doesn't mean that all their resources should now go towards her. In a way, I guess this is an extension of feeling neglected as a child because my sister would always demand attention and gifts from my parents while I was content to be left alone most of the time. I didn't need or want attention, but that they never thought to give it upset me.\n\nNow, to clarify - and this might muddy the waters a bit - my BF and his family are what you'd politely call 'VERY comfortable' in terms of financial situation. My BF has a substantial trust fund, but I myself make a very modest income (as in, if I wasn't living rent-free with my BF I would probably be on the streets). But that shouldn't matter because who knows? What if I don't end up marrying him? Would I still have no wedding fund because they assumed I would be set for life financially?\n\nMy sister meanwhile, is pushing six figures of income (and we don't live in a high COL area) and her fiance's income isn't anything to sneeze at either considering the military pays for most of his expenses. They both spend pretty frivolously (like 1k a month on beauty kind of frivolous and multiple international trips a year), but with some belt tightening they could easily save up enough for a great wedding. My sister alone currently makes more than my parents ever made combined, which is a point of frustration they have both expressed in having to fund this wedding. But weddings are a pretty big deal in my mom's culture, and really it will serve as a family reunion/way to show off for her as many of our relatives from out of the country will be flying in for it. So I can see why in her mind it made sense to 'redirect' the funds set aside for me.\n\nStill, AITA for thinking I deserve 'my cut' of wedding money even if I don't plan to have a 'wedding' per se?",

So the following is Happening and my brain is still not working enough to figure this out by myself.\n\nSo I am on a journey in Thailand right now with my still-bf. Yesterday I got really really sick (maybe food poisoning) and I felt terrible. The whole World was spinning, my stomach fighting itself, my legs were cramping and there was not enough air for my desperate lungs. At first my boyfriend tried his best to help me. Did hold my hair while I kissed the toilet and gave me something to Drink. He is really afraid of me getting pregnant and insisted on me taking my birth control pill while still vomiting. So I of course threw asap up end sent it on a journey through the toilet System. At this Moment I was just shaking and was almost not able to get back to bed. Two hours later (I finally Was able to sleep and escape my pain!), he woke me up and told me to take my pill again, because He read, tagt this is the thing to do. And here is the Part where I really fucked up: I forgot to take an extra blister! So there is no way I can take another one, it is 1 am and we are in the middle of nowhere without a pharmacy. And He got mad, so so mad at me. And I can totally understand that but I am still shaking in agony and throwing up again (so I really doubt that I would be able to even keep the second pill). And He is screaming at me and insulting me and taking away the pillow He gave me, so I can sit up a little (way better for my stupid still Wrestling tummy) and pushing me out of the way (not so great for my stupid stomach). I tried to calm him down (I am at the end of my zyclus and we did not have Sex very often and the only time where something could have happened is two days ago and He did not even Come into me - I know that that is not a safe method, that's why I am taking birth control pills, but just to calm him down a little and I am still feeling sooooooo Bad). I started crying cause it was all to much and begged him to just be a little nicer to me and help me and maybe hug me, because I really could not bare it any longer. He did nothing of that. I spend the whole night shaking and wishing to Die, while He ignored me and sometimes even pushed me, when I came too close to him.\n\nAnd here we are, the day after sitting in front of the only pharmacy and waiting for it too open. The pharmacist told us Over the phone that there is no reason to be concerned, that I just can take the pill after, but she will not open till 11 am (we are sitting here since 7:30). I can totally (totally totally) understand why He is so angry but I feel like He left me alone when I really needed him and I do not know at that moment, how I will ever be able to forgive him. ",

Of those six years, my boyfriend's best friend (FR) has also been living in the same house, for almost four years. We have gone on 2-3 weekend trips a year for the past four years with FR, sharing a hotel room. While its kinda awkward because its just two beds and a bathroom, we've done it to save money so we can do other entertainment things on our weekend trip.\n\nThis year, my boyfriend (i think to believe) is planning on proposing to me later in the year, towards winter I'd assume to save money. BF and i were wanting to on a trip alone just the two of us this year, and after a day of searching fun things to do on a weekend trip, i just asked if we can go to the beach for a couple days for a long weekend, just to relax together. He mentioned bringing FR to the beach since he works long hours and deserves a break, this way it would be cheaper and we can go the whole week to the beach instead of three nights. I agreed, under the circumstance that we get a hotel room with two seperate bedrooms. We found a decently priced condo on the beach, two levels. One bedroom had two queen beds and the other had one kind bed. Because we are dating and FR doesnt date anyone, naturally we took the king bedroom (also its the master bedroom and has beach views and its on the second level loft of the condo and I'M SO EXCITED, as a side note).\n\nI told FR we found a condo, he'd have his own balconly overlooking the bay, his own bathroom and his own bedroom. He seemed annoyed that there were two beds.I should also mention that whenever we DO share a condo room with FR, he snores. Not little snores, but its extremely loud to the point where BF and i cant get sleep.\n\nOur two friends are also getting married in august. BF, FR, and i were invited...wedding is five hours away on a saturday, so I figured we can drive down together on friday and leave on sunday so we dont have to worry about rushing the day of\n\nI mentioned to BF that the hotel that is blocked off has cheaper rates, so we can get our own room so FR has his own. I told FR that yes, it would be more expensive than just sharing a room with us, but this way he has his own bathroom and i can do my makeup and hair. He seemed ok with it, but still sligthtly annoyed that i didnt want to get a hotel room with him. At a romantic rustic cabin hotel. On the night of the wedding...while with my boyfriend of 8 years and while we include him on everything else, even if we are going out to supper as a date night andi see FR is alone at home, i'll see if he wants to go).\n\nFR seemed kinda salty that we were getting our own hotel room, but also I do want sleep the night before and night of the wedding.\n\nAITA for wanting seperate hotel rooms during the weekend of our friend's wedding?",

I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that sheâ€™s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.â€? We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves.

My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise.

I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nSheâ€™s taken from my account without my okay before. Iâ€™ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.

Sheâ€™s now gotten to the age of needing additional help in her life. My parents were hesitant at first but decided it was best for for all of us to hire a lady through hospice care. This lady stays with my grandma 24/7. Lastly I want to mention this hospice care is costing my grandma and family A LOT of money. Final piece of background info this is our second care lady because my mom and grandma did not like the first one. \n\nSo my mom has been complaining A LOT lately about not having â€œfamily timeâ€? anymore. She feels that part of her privacy is gone because thereâ€™s always a â€œstrangerâ€? living with us. Yesterday she told her the care lady who smokes cigarettes that she has to smoke off her property. She told the lady that my dad is â€œallergic to smokeâ€?, he isnâ€™t. \n\nThe day before she told the lady she can no longer eat dinner with us when my mom originally invited her to eat at the table with us the first day she arrived. My mom complains that the lady talks too much at the table and it doesnâ€™t allow every to speak about their day. \n\nSo today my mom was just going on to me about how she doesnâ€™t like someone living with us blah blah blah and I told her to stop. I told her I was sick of hearing her complaining about someone who is trying to make her life easier and my grandmaâ€™s final years painless. I ended with telling her, it is what it is and Iâ€™m done with any conversation that has to do with my mom complaining about this women. My dad was there when I said it and agreed with me that my mom has been complaining a lot. \n\nSince then, my mom just shut down and hasnâ€™t said anything since. I think what I said was a little too much but I feel like it needed to be said. \n\nTL;DR: Mom has been complaining a lot about a hospice lady who lives with us and I told her to stop complaining and I didnâ€™t want to hear anymore of it. \n\n",

I started working for myself last year and because of that we of course had to adjust finances. As of right now we have delinquent Bill's. As a Surprise for my birthday my partner thought a trip  Philadelphia 5 days and  a trip to a museum I had been wanting to visit in Washington would be a great surpriseand she also wanted to attend her sister 40th and the city is where her family lives.  She told me about the surprise a week before we had to leave. When she told me I made sure to be clear that I loved her idea of the trip and to be fair i never outright said that i didn't want to go. I instead before the trip dropped hints like,should we cancel, can we come back early,etc. She told me the tickets were nonrefundable \n Before we left she found out the museum was closed due to government shutdown. So the purpose of the trip is a no go. I really didn't want to come on the trip because I was on point to take care of some due Bill's and I feel like it wasn't a great time to come on a trip regardless if it was for my birthday. I feel like we could've celebrated my birthday at a different time or way.Like dinner or something that I need for the business. I suggested that tho I appreciate the thought, I loved the gesture that it would have been better to ask me if I wanted a trip out of state,because its tax season for the business and I need to work. In response my partner stated that she's hurt because everytime she trys to surprise me it's never right and then preceded to make it about how she thinks I am never satisfied. I told her how I really feel not to hurt her or make her feel bad. I just don't know why she thought it was a great idea now. I really feel like this trip was more about her sisters birthday and I feel trapped in a situation that I didn't ask for and made to feel bad because I feel it wasn't the right time for a trip anywhere.

But it's okay- they're broke too and they're family. I'll do a lot for family without mentioning it. \n\nHalfway though all of this I'm *told* (not asked) that the adult brother is staying at our house for the next 2 weeks (laughable- it'll be a month or more, I'm sure) because he's yet to apply for a job transfer, search for new work in the new town, or even put in his two weeks notice here. He's the only one in that household who works so they can't afford him not working for a few weeks. The parents didn't tell him to transfer or job search either. Neither of these three adults thought about a job ahead of time. They all dropped the ball. \n\nSo I suddenly find out that my heavy daily drinking (none of them will admit he's an alcoholic), chain smoking, non-driving future BIL is living with us. \n\nI already have two small children. I don't have a ton of money for groceries. His parents take all of his money for the household so he doesn't have money for his cigarettes and booze, so he steals ours or we end up buying him some (he's a monster without it). It all falls on my boyfriend and I but I can't say no because they're family and he has \"nowhere else to go\". My boyfriend is used to this because he's taken care of his brother in some way his whole life. Plus they have opposite work schedules so they aren't seeing each other much. \n\nI have a variety of personal physical and mental health issues, including PTSD, so having my own private area is essential to me. \n\nI explained my feelings to my boyfriend and he understands where I'm coming from, but thinks I'm being an asshole for expressing my discomfort with the whole situation instead of powering through it. \n\nI WILL power through the situation, but I feel like a stranger in my and my children's own home because of this all. And my kids don't need to be around heavy drinking. I've kept them and myself confined to my room other than meal times. One of my kids is sleeping on the floor so BIL can have his own room. \n\nThere are other friends he could stay with but then he couldn't wake us up still hammered at 5am for a ride to work (which is within walking distance from my house). \n\nI should mention I previously stopped letting this brother stay over because he always brought drugs into the house, trashed everything, and kept us up all night. But he's not doing that anymore. \n\nAm I the asshole for wishing he could stay somewhere else and trying to express the mental and financial burden this is causing me? I know he's family but I'm so busy and tired.",

I tailgated a car for some time, honked at it, and blew past it, inadvertently cutting him off and forcing him to brake. I admit I made very poor choices; Iâ€™ve learned from them and matured as a driver since. \n\nThe man (a very big, early 40â€™s guy) at the next red light, got out of his car, stormed up to my window, and went ballistic. He spat on me, screamed a series of **extremely** vile racial slurs, death threats (including graphic references to lynching/hanging) and obscenities at me and **my two small daughters** for a full 2 minutes (impeding traffic for some of this time). He screamed **so** unbelievably loud, got freakishly red, the veins started popping out of his head; I was honestly expecting him to have a stroke or burst a vessel. But worst of all, my kids and I feared he might hurt or even kill us.\n\nThe incident terrified me, but scarred my daughters. They cried and cried, had nightmares about the encounter for a long time afterwards, and I had to have some very long discussions with them that I really wished I would not have to have until they were much, much older. The incident sickened and enraged me like nothing I have ever experienced. I just so happened to catch it all on my dashcam; I turned the cam towards him the moment he started in (as evidence if he were to assault me), and saved the footage on my computer just in case I ever had another run in and needed evidence.\n\nCut to two years later. Iâ€™m at an upscale brewery/restaurant with some buddies, look over at the bar area, and who do I see behind the counter, dressed in a nice suit and managing the bar? **The raging driver.** Still bitter, I made eye contact with him, and he froze like a statue and went white with shock when he saw &amp; recognized me. Throughout that dinner, I continued to torment him with a series of sly little grins. When I left to take a bathroom break, he approached me.\n\nHe apologized to me profusely. He claimed heâ€™s severely bipolar and that that was one of his manic outbreaks; he assured me he is not in any way racist or violent, and that if he could do anything to take back his words, he would. He claims to have since gotten his life together; having gone to therapy, gotten medicated, ended his drug abuse habits, etc, and promises me that he is a very changed man. I responded by telling him I still have that video of him raging, can destroy his life and career with a single click, and promptly walked away.\n\nIâ€™m very seriously considering sending the video to his manager, AND even posting the video publicly on social media. Now I know the guyâ€™s name and more info about him, and that he works (and might live) in my close vicinity, I realize it could really make a splash.

We are each other's emotional support through everything and we do everything together. Very recently, my phone broke down and I do not have the financial means to obtain a new one at the moment, so she being the saint that she is let me borrow her old phone that she kept around. When it has WiFi I can use things like snapchat and instagram just so I can contact her.\n\nIn using her old phone, all of her old apps and pictures (including her tinder) are available to me. She did not explicitly state anything about me not going through all of it when we weren't together, so I figure she just assumed I would, but I honestly have not whatsoever. I respect her boundaries and privacy, and figure most of the stuff I would find in there happened before we ever even met and I would not be happy with what I saw, so why even bother.\n\nThe problem here arrives when I received a notification about a day after I received her phone to use. I got a notification from instagram, but as her account. At this point I had not used the app yet, so her account was still signed in. However, when I opened the app to see what was up, it prompted me to log in - I could not use her account, yet I was still getting notifications from it. It was at this point that I was going to sign in with my own credentials so as to not get her notifications, but what I actually did I am slightly ashamed of. I read the notification and saw that it was not from anybody she normally talks to, or anybody that I know. It was from a man our age that goes to our university, and the contents of the messages made me not want to sign out. I became extremely anxious because his messages went something like this:\n\n\\- \"Hey\" (11pm the night before I saw)\n\n\\- \"Good morning Beautiful\" (the first notification I saw in the morning)\n\n\\- \"Were you at so-and-so's concert last night? I think I saw you\" (I took her to a nearby musician's concert for a celebration, I bought her tickets and just the two of us went)\n\n\\- \"What are you doing later?\"\n\nNow I cannot see her messages that she is responding to him because since I am receiving her notifications, I am only getting his messages. I do know that she was responding though based on the fact that he liked one of her messages that she sent to him. I also know that after the last message he sent there was no other contact. She does not have him on any other form of social media, so instagram notifications would let me know if anything else happened. I do not know what she said, if anything, to the last message.\n\nSo I suppose this is the question - AITA for not signing out of her account upon seeing those types of messages? Should I confront her about this, or let it slide for now as he seems to have stopped talking to her?",

His parents consider me a son (I've been known them for well over ten years). Kara comes from a wealthy family. Four years ago, I met Kara at a hospital internship and introduced her to my friend group. Kara and Jim started dating last summer and she moved into Jim's room within the month they started dating (Jim is working on his second bachelor's, so he lives in his parents basement).\n\nThis semester I moved in with my SO (dating 5.5 years now) to her dorm at school. My home life isn't the best, domestic abuse and all that, so I was ecstatic for this change. Each person in the suite has their own room and bathroom.\n\nSo the semester goes on. Kara's parents don't know she is living with Jim, so they are still paying for her dorm room (about $14K a year). She uses it as a glorified supply closet, Kara slept there maybe once or twice. At Jim's house, Kara does not do her own laundry, do chores, or pick up after herself. As Jim and Kara have been together, Kara has distanced herself more and more from the group.\n\nOverall, Jim and Kara's relationship is so-so. She says she has anxiety driving, so Jim drives her to school even on the days he doesn't have school. Keep in mind, it's a 30 minute commute. The last time Jim told her he can't drive her anymore, she gave him the cold shoulder for days until he started driving her to school again. I think Jim just stays with her because she likes video games.\n\nDuring the semester I am taking a full course load and working three jobs. Christmas rolls around and we throw a party. Before everyone gets there, Kara makes a comment about how surprised she was that I am at the party instead of working because \"all I care about is money.\"\n\nI make a sarcastic comment agreeing with her, that all I care about is money. Kara says I \"am mooching off someone else's money\" (referring to me staying with my SO in her dorm which my SO's parents pay for). I point out that maybe she should care a little more about money because of her dad paying for her dorm she doesn't use while she mooches off her boyfriend by living in his parent's basement. She leaves and doesn't speak to me for 2 months.\n\nToday I asked Kara, nice as you please, if she has a problem with me. She says yes, she hates me, and she doesn't want me in her life anymore. She already told Jim I can't go to their wedding (they aren't engaged?) She goes on ad nauseum about how much she hates me and how I am the worst person alive. I implore her to tell me what I did wrong, or what features about me are so awful. That way, I can work on them, and maybe become a better person. She refuses to tell me a single thing off her \"huge list of awful features\" she has of me and ends up slamming the door in my face.\n\nTLDR: I was friends with a girl, now she says \"I am the worst person alive.\"",

I have always took care of her, probably a little too much, but her health was just getting worse and worse. It has been putting a large strain on our relationship. We are both university students and on the day in question we had made plans to hang out after class. That day goes by and I dont hear from her and so I keep trying to get in touch with her to see if she's ok and if we are still hanging out.

She then proceeds to say no and that she hopefully wont be there more than a day and is just staying overnight and not to come. I really wasn't comfortable with this but she asked me to give her some space so I did. She leaves the hospital and I visit her at home as soon as she tells me she's home. A few days later she's back in the hospital this time for a few days. Again I ask if I should come down to her and she tells me no. Again I stay up at school and as soon as she is out of the hospital and back home I drive down to see her and make sure she's ok. Flashforward to the other day when all of a sudden she asks me, why didn't you visit me at the hospital? I was honestly shocked and pretty offended that she asked me that and I told her as much. She was the one who adamantly told me not to go to the hospital and now she is saying that this is a red flag in our relationship that I didnt visit. I'm pretty hurt as i wanted to drop everything to go to the hospital but she was the one who said not to.

He is a \"nice\" guy and when I see him hes hugs all over me and talks kindly, then I wont hear from him again for months. That is the manipulation. Its hard to recognize because of how nice he is. He never raised a hand or his voice to me growing up. Very mild tempered. He has held a grudge against me from when I was 11 years old. The day I told him I wanted to live with my grandma because he was depressed and would not give me any attention. Ever since I have heard from him very rarely. His balls are basically in his wife's pocket. Its his third wife and he wont risk losing another one, he does whatever she says. Im a single mom of two kids, 3 and 5. They rarely see him, he doesn't call them. When they used to visit my grandma he would drive by there and see them for 10 minutes. He would act like hes grandpa of the year. He didnt want them at his house...which was fine I knew they were babies and difficult to handle. After years of never asking for a favor, I told him I was invited on an amazing trip and it would be something for me to do on my own, and have a break. I am trying to plan for my kids to be taken care of for 8 days and giving everyone 2 months notice. I live 6 hours from family so I thought everyone would be looking forward to seeing the kids.  I asked my dad if he would like to have them for 2 nights over the weekend. He lives on a farm and I know they would love seeing the animals. He says he has to ask his wife and comes back with \"I want to see them but I cant spend my 2 nights off watching kids. It isn't fair to me or wife. They should be your priority and you cant just leave them for this amount of time. Watching them for a couple hours is one thing but the whole weekend is another. This isn't a break, its extreme\". I never ask him for anything. Its not the trip, I can take or leave the trip, its him making it seem like its such an annoying request. He said that he cant maintain a relationship with them because I live too far away. I said people live a distance from their grand kids all the time and make it a priority to talk to them. I am driving the kids there and picking them up. I ask for childcare maybe twice a year from my mom for 2 nights. AITA for cutting him off for good from our lives? Maybe I am being entitled and dont realize it. I know they are my responsibility and no one elses. I never thought asking for family help would feel so much like begging. You would think they would want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to mention he is holding a mini grudge against me for leaving my husband. I was emotionally and mentally abused and cheated on, but he blames me for tearing apart the kids family. He is projecting his past pain from my mom leaving him and the divorce hurting my brother and I onto me, and thinks I could have stayed for the kids sake.",

            "input": "So I'm married with a couple of step-kids that live with their mom and I. The older kid is doing great, but the younger (14) has gotten involved in some pretty bad things in the past year, including some illegal activity, as well as self-harm including cutting. Additionally, on two different occasions last year, including as recently as November, she purposely overdosed on medication but (thank heavens) regretted it afterwards and let us know so we could get her to the hospital. We now keep all blades and medications locked up and out of reach. We have of course been getting her the best help we can afford for her, including solid counseling and psychiatry evaluation. Her psychiatrist believe that she is likely bi-polar.\n\nAfter the second attempt, I noticed the patterns that start to emerge from her when she's likely to cause harm to herself. She exhibits heavy depression, wears extra layers of makeup (and much darker makeup as well), refuses to talk about what's bothering her when asked, usually denying that anything's wrong, pushes everyone away, and attempts to withdraw into the bathroom or her bedroom for a long period of time. This also seems to occur more often around times that should be celebrated, like holidays and family birthdays. So, twice since November I've noticed things getting dark and heavy with her, and decided to go on suicide watch. I'm probably not the most skilled at this, I've never had previous exposure with suicidal people or had any training or anything of the sort. Also, there seem to be a lack of information online of what to do in these situations (other than the stuff we're already doing). So as far as I can tell, I should make sure that I or someone else should be able to see her at all times, including if she's in her room, the bathroom, etc. I know we've done our best to limit her access to self-harm tools, but I believe she's also smart enough to hide some stashes of things throughout our (unfortunately) cluttered house so she can self-harm if she wants. So when I've gone on suicide watch these two times, I allow her to still go anywhere she wants. I do make sure that I or some other family member (especially if she's going to the bathroom) has an eye on her at all times. This makes my step-daughter angry to no end, yelling, screaming about how she has no privacy.\n\nLast night was the second time and was particularly bad. She was trying very hard to lock herself off in her room. I started by trying to encourage her to come out and be with the family, letting her know we really wanted her company. She insisted that she was going to do laundry in her room. I told her that's fine, but I would need to be in there with her. She freaked out and kept trying to argue with me about it. She asked if her aunt (who was over at the time) could watch her instead, and I told her that's fine, but I would need to speak with the aunt first to give her some instructions (such as make sure you keep an eye on her even if she's in the bathroom, etc). Step-daughter would not go for this, freaked out more.\n\nWife came downstairs and tried to help. She tried to negotiate with step-daughter, saying she could just leave the door halfway open and that would be good enough and we would be down the hall and come check on her from time to time. Step-daughter would not budge insisting that she had every right to have her door fully closed and be all alone. I didn't agree with my wife on this because I feel like she only needs a few moments to find a tool and do self harm, but I kept quiet and let her try. Step-daughter wouldn't agree to any of wife's terms anyways.\n\nEventually I stepped in front of her bedroom door so she couldn't attempt to shut it on me and lock us out, and then she ran out of her room bawling and up the stairs. I tried following behind her and my wife grabbed my hand and told me \"don't\". I yanked my hand away and I followed step-daughter up the stairs. Step-daughter got to the top of the stairs, turned around and bolted back downstairs to her room, with me following all the way. She slammed the bedroom door shut but I got it open before she could lock it and held it open. She then started hitting me with her fists while bawling. At this point my wife grabbed her and held her and her aunt stepped in to help provide some comfort, and I left.\n\nI'm trying to do the right thing here. I want to be safe and am not interested in violating her privacy or restricting her in any way other than when she's most vulnerable to self-harm. But my other step-daughter, mother-in-law, and wife all had some negative feedback for me. Mother-in-law and other step-daughter say I was scary chasing after step-daughter the way I did. Wife believes step-daughter should have been allowed to run up the stairs alone and been given some room to grieve in complete privacy. I disagree because I believe she would have locked herself in the upstairs bathroom or another room and potentially found a way to hurt or kill herself in there. I suspect wife thinks that my suicide watch is overly controlling and is in fact having the wrong effect, in other words that I'm driving her to more likely self-harm. I don't know if she's right or not.\n\nI feel like I'm in crazy town. I feel like I'm the only one on board with doing what's necessary to keep her safe when she's at the low end of her cycle. If I'm the asshole, or even if I'm not, I want to know what I can do better because I very much do want my step-daughter to be safe. Would definitely love to hear from some professionals or other people experienced with these sort of situations.\n\nSo tell me, Reddit. Am I the asshole?",

However, I also needed to do laundry. I went to the dresser to find that the quarters were no longer there. There was however a note saying \"thank you for the tip! I'm very greatful!\". I was a little shook as those quarters weren't intended as tip...\n\nI took the note and went downstairs because I wasn't sure what to do. The following conversation took place:\n\nMe: \"hey, so this is a little awkward because this person was so nice about it, but I had some quarters on my dresser for laundry and they aren't there anymore...\"\n\nFront desk (FD): \"oh, we're so sorry about that! (They really are nice people) how much was there?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not sure of the exact amount, but it was between $5-$10\"\n\nFD: \"oh, well here's $10 of quarters to make up for it\"\n\nMe: \"... Oh, uh, thank you?\"\n\nThese people were too nice that I didn't really know how to respond except to accept the quarters. As I did, I realized that I might be an asshole by accepting it.

Now that I think about it, it isn't that big of a deal...\" (The cleaning person signed their name on the note)\n\nFD: \"oh, it's fine, they won't be in trouble\"\n\nSo I just handed it over.

I had stressed the importance of getting a 2nd story unit as I had heard reviews saying that the insulation between floors was awful. Unfortunately due to improper communication on the managements front we were stuck into a first floor unit. And it is as every bit bad as the reviews stated.\n\nThe first few nights of being there our upstairs neighbors would have their young child up and running around the unit until around 2-3am in the morning. Every footfall sounded like a hammer on our ceiling. I tried using my fan on a higher setting and putting in ear-plugs to dampen the noise. And unfortunately, it didn't do anything. I would just have to wait out the noise to go to sleep. \n\nI wanted to give our neighbors the benefit of a doubt, in that they probably had no idea how poorly insulated the units were. At this point, it was nearing the holidays so I had bought some cards and candy and thought to write them a friendly note. I delivered it to their door with some candies before work. It read like this:\n\"Dear upstairs neighbors,\n\nI don't know if you're aware of this, but unfortunately, our building's floors and ceilings are not well sound-proofed. For the most part, everything has been okay. However, there have been quite a few times where we have been disturbed and interupted while sleeping from the little tyke running and playing into the wee hours of the morning. We would appreciate if you would please take this into account.\nIf you have any questions or concerns we wouldn't mind meeting, We'd also like the chance to get to know you betterðŸ˜Š!\"\n\nThe next few nights had been hit or miss, but enough that I thought they were trying. A week or so passes and I step outside and see someone had left their stroller next to the stairs of our connected units. It was pretty cold and wet out, and thought it would be frustrating for the owner to come out to a frozen or at the very least, soaked stroller. I felt incredibly nervous to but I walked up the stairs to see if it was theirs. I knocked on the door a couple of times to no answer. As I was headed back out to the parking lot I heard someone open a door. It was one of the neighbors. I stopped to say hello and mentioned why I had knocked on the door.  Once she figured out I was the neighbor underneath her unit she admitted that things could get loud since her husband came home late from work and that her child was up and down all night. I exclaimed that I really appreciated what they were doing and understood that young children could be up and down all night and that it was probably more the poor sound-proofing than anything. \nNot even two days later, I'm ringing customers out at work and lo and behold my neighbors come through my line. I didn't even realize it until the woman recognized me. She made a point to emphasize that they had left their daughter at home, which I thought was odd. Once she had been cashed out her husband walks over and asks if I was the one who wrote the note. I said I was. to which he asked me again a couple more times, slightly more aggressively each time. The Woman asked me if I had children in a way that made me unsure if she meant\n\"We heard strange noises from your apartment that sounded like cihldren.\"\n\t\t\t\tor\n\"How dare you judge us and tell us what to do since we have children and you don't\"\nAt the time I read it as the first and told them that I had a cat that occasionally knocked things over to get attention during the day and had a high pitched meow.\nBut to the second more likely interpretation, I have no intent on judging them for having children. I just wanted to let them know what could be heard from downstairs, in as polite a way as possible.\nThey had a pretty loud argument that night and its taken a couple more talks since then to get the noise settled down by midnight.\nTL;DR:  AITA for asking our neighbors to quiet down?\n",

Around December we became friends with her again. \n\nIn January it was revealed that I didnt trust C and he said we couldnt be friends which I was okay with. He was still friends with my best friend. A couple weeks later he decided he couldn't be friends with my best friend because she was friends with his ex. He told her this over text in a dramatic \"I just cant...\" shit and it broke her heart.  A couple weeks later he texted us and begged for our forgiveness which I immediately declined due to him hurting my best friend so badly. She gladly exepted even though I suggested he shouldn't. A month later him and his ex threw allegations at eachother and both of them made her choose a side.\n A couple days later he pulled the same shit as last time and ended it over text with the same dramatic shit pretending he was the victim. Again my best friend was heartbroken. Now to this day it still affects her because she never got closure. We are thinking of seeking closer from him to help her out because she misses him. \n\nNow she does confront him I would be there with her for emotional support and try to keep herself from forgiving him.

And I guess itâ€™s possible IATA if Iâ€™m already thinking it.\n\nTL;DR- Constantly clingy friend has been smothering me. Contemplated telling her to stop it. While brainstorming points and considering factors on how to break this news in the most frank but sensitive way, clingy friend calls immediately to tell me sheâ€™s pregnant. Keeps saying things over and over again how I need to be there, guide her, and without context.\n\nFull version:\n\nMy best friend has been awfully clingy lately. So much Iâ€™ve gone out of my way to do favors for her, do whatever she wants, etc. She is grateful for the time spent and sometimes makes up for it by buying a gift as a token of appreciation but Iâ€™m usually wiped out before she asks for favors the next day. Sheâ€™ll often point out how much I do for her too or tell others how Iâ€™d practically die for her. Itâ€™s strange..\n\nMy best friend will call me sometimes in the middle of the work week and ask if I have plans over the weekend. I love the advanced notice instead of springing news on me within 30 min. Before somethingâ€™s happening; but because I feel smothered as it is Iâ€™m either trying to find an excuse to get out of a pre-invite, be stupidly honest and say nothing to where then she excitedly makes a schedule for US, or I tell her we actually do have plans with family or friends.\nBut it never fails.. the weekend rolls around and my phone will ding me at least three times a day â€œWhat are you up to now?â€? â€œIs your family gone?â€? â€œAre you home now from the movies?â€? â€œCan I come over and show my husband your new guest room?â€? â€œOkay then but can you come over instead perhaps, like, immediately?â€?\nMy husband is starting to find this behavior annoying and he shakes his head in disappointment at me if I canâ€™t bare to firmly say, â€˜Noâ€™ because Iâ€™m nervous to hurt her feelings or have a big blow up over it as we have had before 6 years ago.... calling me a bad friend because I never go out of my way to invite her over or do stuff. I just hope things are different now.\n\nAfter some Reddit advice and consideration, I start to brainstorm how to tell my friend I need space. That I love her, and will always be, but I feel sick. And sometimes my feelings are important and I need time alone to recharge, including the stressful texts. I try to ease my mind and settle down by doing some laundry when my phone blows up again. Sheâ€™s calling.\n\nI answer it and think sheâ€™s hurt because sheâ€™s frantic and crying. Instead, sheâ€™s just announced she is pregnant. Iâ€™m honestly a little floored but still congratulate her and tell her itâ€™s okay to cry and have mixed emotions as itâ€™s a big thing. Before she can hang up to go tell her husband as heâ€™s walking in the door, she cuts me off, â€œPROMISE ME YOULL BE THERE.â€? I answer â€œSure.â€? Not really know what the heck that means. She says it again, â€œNo, Iâ€™m serious. I need to know if youâ€™re fully invested in this because I canâ€™t do this alone. Promise me youâ€™ll be there and stick through this, on my sideâ€”gotta go!â€? And hangs up.\n\nWhat does that even mean?...\n\nShe texts me five minutes later, â€œCome over right now?â€?\n\nI say no. I canâ€™t. (A lie, although I am doing my bedding and itâ€™s 7pm, I havenâ€™t had dinner yet)\n\nShe texts me back, â€œWhat can I eat?â€?\n\nI respond, â€œYâ€™know... Considering your pregnant now youâ€™re really going to have to do some research on x , y , z and know for yourself what you may like, the baby wonâ€™t. Stay away from the most commonly known bad food for pregnancies (caffeine, liquor, fish with high mercury, etc).â€?\n\nSheâ€™s texted me back an hour later, â€œYou swear youâ€™ll help me right? Im panicking. I need you.â€?\n\nBut help with what?!? Iâ€™m not a professional, a doctor, an OBGYN, a nutritionist, a trainer, Iâ€™m not her husband, her mom, her doula, nor will I pay money to buy things as I have my own finances to worry about and I have to save up. (Sheâ€™s seen things at stores and randomly asks me to buy them for her, even before pregnancy).  Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t have a choice as Iâ€™m not the one whoâ€™s pregnant and itâ€™s not my kid/responsibility.\n\nSo reddit, before this goes down possibly horribly because I donâ€™t know how sheâ€™ll react, AITA for not wanting to be there 100% of the time sheâ€™s pregnant or needs my helpâ€”or whatever it is she means? I have a life too.\n(Iâ€™m sure in our discussion I will ask her to specify her needs and what I can and cannot do for her.)\nI can assure you I will tell her I still love her.. and remain good friends.. but I canâ€™t hold her hand the whole way. I donâ€™t have kids and donâ€™t want any still for a few more years. I am the last of my girl friends to ever conceive and Iâ€™ve been useful and helpful in ways but not there all the time.",

We ended up having babies about a month apart which brought us back to chatting and being friends.\n\nThe old Jane (1+ yrs ago) used to ask me to do things for her CONSTANTLY. Basically at the time the friendship was her using me to look after he animals all the time at her home she was â€œrenovatingâ€?, while she was off in another town with John, going to parties etc. I stopped all contact with her and basically ended the friendship. She reached out to me 3 months ago after seeing I had given birth to my son just a month after she had given birth to her own. I was happy to give it another go, thinking things might be different since shes become a mother.\n\nOk so...\n\nJane about three days before her Hens party invited me when to tag along. She had organized go karting, drinks and dinner. I said I might be able to go depending on my 3 month old son. \n\nJane said she was just going to drink and still breastfeed her 4 month old and that â€œif youâ€™re ok to drive then youâ€™re ok to feedâ€?. \n\nThe day before said Hens, she asked me if I was coming and I said no. I truthfully said my son was cluster feeding and that I was unable to pump enough milk to go out and drink/to be away from him for hours.\n\nJane bombarded me with messages saying the following;\n\n- come out but donâ€™t drink\n- iâ€™ll give you some of my breastmilk\n- just bring him along\n- just at least call in then (venue is an hour away from me)\n\nI was so overwhelmed that I said I would pump and see how I got on and MIGHT call in but that I also might not. \n\nNeedless to say I didnâ€™t get on very well with pumping and decided to stay home. I didnâ€™t feel safe taking my baby out to a pub/club and being around heavily intoxicated people, so I didnâ€™t want to â€œjust call inâ€? either. Secondly I just feel that my partying days have passed and Iâ€™m not into getting wasted anymore. \n\nSo day of hens party I got sidetracked when family came to visit, house work, grocery shopping, baby stuff etc that when she messaged me the place they were going to for drinks and dinner, I didnâ€™t end up messaging her back. \n\nToday was the day after the hens party and I woke up, saw the message again and thought oh i will ask her out to lunch at this nice place to make up for me not going and that it would be more suitable as i can bring baby and she can bring her baby too.\n\nJane asked me to call and then she rang and she proceeded to say she doesnâ€™t think the friendships working out, why didnâ€™t I respond or turn up, doesnâ€™t think we should be friends anymore etc etc. I explained that my babyâ€™s needs come first and I couldnâ€™t go and that I had said that to her and she still insisted I turn up, etc but she ended up just hanging up mid phone call and blocking me on all social media (her partner also blocked me too).",

It took about a year's worth of love and therapy, at the end of which we got together, to get her out of the deep depression she was in after he dumped her.\n\nWhen started Dating, M suddenly took interest in D again, he continuously pestered her to be friends with him (which I was adamantly against. Might sound controlling of me, but after learning the kinds of things he did to D and other girls I just couldn't allow him to be near her). After 2 years of this D agreed to be friends with him - D's therapist WHO KNEW THE THINGS HE DID advised that D befriend him as a means of \"letting go\" of the past and forgiving him.\n\nI voiced my objections to this the moment I found out, but eventually accepted it because it was what D felt she wanted. \n\nOver the course of the next 2 years, D would get increasingly flirty vibes from M(late night Texts, long hugs, surprise kisses on the cheek, etc), and even though I wanted and should have told him off (or beat the shit out of him) - D would tell me not to, and that I should trust her transparency about it and just ignore him - so I went along with it. That was until I found out M was getting way too flirty with D and was driving her down and away from her life goals that she had been working so hard towards - after and incident where M confessed he still loved D and kissed her when she was in no position to resist (I was not there at the time, but her friends were and did nothing to help her), we talked about how D needed to stop interacting with M - She surprisingly agreed to that, and was realizing how toxic M was to her and her future. \n\nA month or so later I found out that they were still hanging out and doing things that might not have been cheating, but were definitely not good for our relationship and her mental health.\n\nI confronted D about lying to me, and told her that she needs to stop seeing him or its over between us - to which, and I quote, she said \"I can't decide which one of you I love more\"... I told her things were over between us the moment I heard that.\n\nSince then I've been getting texts from her friends calling me an asshole and saying how much they always hated me. I also learned that D has been hanging out with M to cope with apparently the worst thing to ever happen to her, which was me... I honestly feel like I made the right choice, but I'm starting to question myself.... so AITA?\n\nTL;DR - I dumped my now ex because she continued hanging out with her friend who was her extremely abusive Ex, even after she promised she wouldn't.",

Everything I owed to anyone was paid back. My roommate hated the job he had, and I offered to help out as he switched jobs. That's when the shit started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe became very quiet about money in general, and made it extremely weird asking for money for bills, saying shit like \"just because you make more money doesn't mean I'm ready to pay for things\". I helped him with rent month after month, and added up everything I helped with on a spreadsheet. I knew he was struggling and I wanted to be helpful, but also wanted accountability on his part. Each month, the first would come and go and he wouldn't say a word, no rent money, nothing. I'd have to keep an extra $500 of my money sitting in my account so the checks would go through, and some months I'd have to ask where rent was and he would suddenly come up with excuses why he could only pay a portion. Up and up the money he owed me stacked. Utilities? He didn't bother asking what it was, and didn't pay until I asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne morning when I woke up to $10 in my bank account, I lost it. He was working, so I texted him a long message about how I expected rent NOW, and how I didn't understand how he never has money even though I'm fully aware of how much money he makes. He pulled the \"but I helped you when you needed it\" card, like I owed him for it. I shot back with how I paid everything back, and I didn't use help more than a handful of times. Overall I felt justified because month after month I was covering his rent, and not always getting it back in full, or at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince this happened, he showed me all his bills and income, and I turned the tables by making him use his account. I subtract utilities from the rent I pay him and it's working well so far. But sometimes I wonder if I was making an ass of myself bitching him out when he was still struggling.",

Everything was fine until 3 weeks ago when I got a FB message from a girl that was screenshots of their conversation. He created a fake Insta account messaging her telling her how gorgeous she is, etc. Note, this is not the first time this happened. So I confront him, he denies it, I have proof, he lies, I tell him he has to leave, he does. A few days pass and we talk about what happened; he said he had been suppressing stuff that made him unhappy. Well, this is the SAME reason he reached out to a girl the first time. At this point, I am SO mad that he would throw away our relationship over simply not coming to me and communicating â€œHey, my feelings are hurt over X, Y and Z.â€? and then we can talk, fix it and be happy again. I am willing to work through this and make us work again. He says he needs his time.\n\nWe met up after a 1.5 weeks, he says the same thing; he needs more time to figure himself out. So I ask him upfront, are there any other girls in the picture? He tells me straight up, no. He isnâ€™t interested, doesnâ€™t want anything to do with girls, just wants to be alone and figure himself out. He asks me for another week of time and asks me to wait for him. I oblige. Monday rolls around, he texts me wanting to get back together. He makes plans to pack up his stuff (heâ€™s been staying at a friendâ€™s whoâ€™s lease is up March 1st) and come home today.\n\nDuring our time apart, through mutual friends, I saw him drunk at a club. So I tell him I need to know if anything happened. He said yes, he had a one night stand. I am devastated. We had been apart for less than 2 weeks when he hooked up with a girl during the extra week that HE requested while asking me to wait for him. At this point, I am broken and furious. I tell him he canâ€™t come back and I donâ€™t want to work things out. He tells me heâ€™s moving back in anyway. I ask him to move in with his parents which would be free and he refuses. He says he canâ€™t afford two rents for his own place and he refuses to pay for a place that he canâ€™t live in. I am crushed; all I want is to move forward with my life and be able to get over him but I canâ€™t do that when I have to see him every day for the next 6 months. Iâ€™m on student loans so I canâ€™t afford the rent alone. So here he is, he cheats on me, asks me to wait for him, goes and has a one night stand, and then still gets to come back home? He gets to have his cake and eat it too. I feel like Iâ€™m being manipulated and controlled in his forcing me to live with him after all of this. So tonight I want to revisit the idea of him moving back in with his parents. Maybe I can talk to the complex about moving into a smaller apartment so the rent is less for us both. So AITA for asking him to move back in with his parents and still pay his half of the rent because this is his fuck up and he is legally obligated to pay?",

Five months ago, I was dealing with constant jaw pain and numbness in parts of my face. After seeing doctors and dentists, I finally landed at an oral surgeonâ€™s office who took an X-ray and found my wisdom teeth were technically impacted but actively growing at the wrong angle. The reason I was experiencing numbness is because the my teeth are pressing down on a nerve, and surgery will be necessary to prevent possible permanent damage. I scheduled my surgery to land specifically on spring break for my school. Pretty much all of my professors this semester take off points for missing class, so missing an entire week was entirely out of the question for something Iâ€™m paying $21K for. This was in December.\n\nI asked my boyfriend immediately afterwards if he would be able to watch me for my surgery. Heâ€™s ending trade school so we planned ahead to make sure he would be free during the time I went for my surgery. Everything fit perfectly and we confirmed this was the plan. \n\nThis all changed about three weeks ago, when he got a call from a possible employer who was demanding that he start training on the same day of my surgery. My boyfriend asked if he could delay until the day after and explained the situation, but the employer basically brushed him off and said â€œshe knows itâ€™s a job right?â€? \n\nThat annoyed me immensely, seeing as this surgery is necessary and Iâ€™m not allowed to be by myself, but whatever. We had a heated discussion about it and I told him that if he canâ€™t do it to let me know NOW so I can arrange a â€œbaby sitterâ€? as soon as possible. He kinda went back and forth on it and then decided that he doesnâ€™t want to work with this specific company and that heâ€™ll bring me for my surgery. Okay, cool, I can relax. \n\nToday(less than a week before my surgery), he tells me he canâ€™t take me to my surgery. We get into a huge argument and he says he wants to go to the interview so that it can be on his resume for future employers to look at it. Iâ€™m pissed because I canâ€™t find anybody to take me, everyone I know is busy. The paperwork specifically says Iâ€™m not allowed to leave the center by myself because Iâ€™ll be under the influence; someone has to check me out, so I canâ€™t even get an Uber. He says I should consider his employment, but I donâ€™t think any future employer is going to care that he got a job interview and trained for one day then quit. In fact, I think this shows a lack of commitment. \n\nI feel super guilty because I donâ€™t want to say he canâ€™t go to his interview but now I have to ask a friend to take the day off last minute.

We saw and approached two attractive women in their late 20's, one it turns out was an actress on a TV show (not famous, but whatever) and the other an artist. \n\nWe all had a flirty, fun convo with them for maybe 10-15 minutes. After everyone finished their respective drinks I asked them if they wanted to continue on together and join us for a cocktail at a place a few minutes away. They happily agreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe new place was quite crowded and it was hard to find a table to sit at. Once we find one, I have to head back to the bar to get drinks as there is no table service. I take everyone's order and pay for a round of cocktails, since its a pay as you guy type of system, and walk the tray of libations back to the table.\n\nAfter a few minutes of chatting,  both ladies casually mention that they have boyfriends that they live with. As any person knows, this sort of info is disappointing to hear after you've invested time into someone you are interested in, but life goes on. We continue conversing about this and that and the mood is generally pretty good, although the convo is losing a bit of luster as time goes on.\n\nI was just finishing my drink and they were about 3/4 through theirs, and they announce that they are going to go for a cigarette in a minute. I suggest that they order the next round on their way out from the bar to the street so the bartender can make the drinks while they smoke, and save everyone a few minutes of waiting. They look at each other and think it's a joke for some reason, and give a sassy, tongue in cheek answer of \"if you want a drink, you know how to do it.\"\n\nI smile, and ask again, \"yeah, but seriously, I'd love to get another one of these. It's your round, after all, and you are going right by the bartender.\" They seem dumbfounded by this and again look at each other like I'm crazy for asking.\n\n\"No, that's not how it works,\" they say again sort of devilishly smiling. \"Nice try though!\" They head out for their cigarette. My buddy also announces he has to pee, and heads off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I feel a bit like I've been taken advantage of. Call me crazy, but when I'm with friends, we will all take turns buying rounds. I'm happy to buy a gal a drink as part of the little ritual, but these two always had boyfriends. So they weren't going into it as part of the ritual, it was always a platonic type of situation for them in their minds. So why would they be exempt from buying a round after having one bought for them?  \n  \n\nThis is the AITA moment of truth. When they are outside I grab both their drinks and finish them. It's a rash decision, and one that obviously flaunts all norms of social courtesy, but in my mind it's acceptable and fitting. They broke the social code of offering to reciprocate, and in a fairly rude and dismissive manner. They seemed to have a level of entitlement that I didn't appreciate. And I had no interest in seeing them again. So fuck it, I'm going to drink the drinks I paid for.\n\nWhen they come back in and see that their glasses are only comprised of ice and a straw, the reaction is one of anger and disgust. They ask why I would do that and I tell them that I bought the drinks and they had no interest in buying the next round, so take it for what it is. A few choice words are thrown my way and they grab their stuff and hastily leave. \n\nMy buddy, just back from the toilet, watches all this unfold and has no idea what has happened. When I explain to him he thinks it's all crazy, but laughs, and we continue on.   \n\n\nSo yeah, I think there is some asshole behavior on my part, but it only came out as a response to what I saw as assholish behavior.

I moved out before they moved in, and right now I'm back home from college for spring break.\n\nMy BIL brought his dog with him when he moved in with my sister two years ago. Both he and the dog came from an abusive household and she was definitely the worse for wear. She had open wounds from other animals and was extremely anxious about just about everything. She seemed to be recovering for awhile, but her cuts got infected despite treatment, and earlier this year she started on several rounds of intense antibiotics. We've spent thousands of dollars on tests and treatments at this point. Nothing has worked so far, and at present she is stuck in a Cone of Shame with the injuries from two years ago still open and she's lost so much weight she's basically a skeleton. None of the vets have really given a prognosis, but at this point it's hard to imagine her recovering.\n\nI adore this dog. She's incredibly sweet and loving despite everything she's been through, and she's always happy for someone to snuggle her. I'm an animal lover and would be typically happy to oblige, but... I'm also incredibly squeamish and can't handle gore of any type, ESPECIALLY on animals. Looking at her back makes me gag. Like I said, these are two-year-old infected injuries. They're not pretty. We've tried covering them up with doggy t-shirts, but that just ended with blood- and pus-soaked shirts and a minor rash from the friction of the cloth.\n\nLike most dogs, BILs is always on the hunt for soft places to sit, and my bed has become one of her favorites. I sleep with my door closed so I typically move all of the animals out before going to bed, so as to avoid accidents and whatnot. By now I've resorted to having my mom move her away to one of the sofas, sister and BILs room, or anywhere else soft before I go to sleep. I feel like such a jerk for taking her away from where she wants to be when she probably doesn't have long left and should just be petted for hours on end and let sleep wherever the hell she wants. But at the same time, I don't want to worry about kicking her or rolling on top of her in my sleep, or to wake up to find that her cuts are bleeding or oozing again, that she's had a bathroom accident, or worst case scenario, that she's died. I personally didn't sign on for the responsibility of having any dog, much less one this sick, and I don't really think it's fair to myself to force myself to deal with it head-on. But I still feel like the worst person in the world because she deserves any small pleasure she can get at this point and I'm taking that away just so I can starfish when I sleep.\n\nNo one has called me an asshole for this, but man, I feel like one.\n\nSo, AITA for kicking a sick animal out of a soft place?",

He refuses to eat anything outside of American staples like: steak, eggs, pancakes, bacon, burgers, fries, basic sandwiches, etc... And I get everyone has preferences, I really do. EXCEPT this grown ass man refuses to try anything else. He has never had pizza, he has never had any sort of pasta dish, let alone any \"eccentric cuisines\" as he likes to call them. Not even bland boxed macaroni. I thought maybe it was a weird family thing, but apparently his parents are as dumbfounded as I am. He has never even tried anything you can't find at a local Dennys. And no, he is not lying. Apparently it just doesn't appeal to him.\n\nAs you can imagine, this has made choosing restaurants for dates hard. I can't even get him into Mediterranean food, let alone anything \"exotic\" like Indian food, or authentic Chinese food. We live in a city too, so we have so many options but we keep going to steak restaurants are burger joints and it is getting old very fast and I keep getting annoyed that I have to compromise with him - just because we both like steak doesn't mean I want to eat it every week.\n\nI've really started to push, beg, bribe him into trying new foods with me, to going to restaurants I like, but he keeps getting mad that I am trying to \"change\" him, and that I keep making him do things he doesn't want to do. Its pretty early in the relationship, and we have a great time outside of this one sticky issue. So am I being the asshole here with trying to push him out of his comfort zone? Or is he the one for not being willing to try anything new?",

In the ten years since then we've kept in regular contact, but out lives have gone in drastically different directions. I have always been interested in music and songwriting and have been writing songs as a hobby since I was very young. I went to college and then obtained an advanced degree in musicology. I currently work in the music industry, although not as a musician or songwriter.\n\nMy friend is just kind of doing the same stuff he did when we were young. Can't hold down a job and sits around drinking and watching sports all day. We don't see each other often, but we do talk and I don't really feel like we have much in common anymore. I am not into sports and that's really all he ever wants to talk about. The friendship at this point is based more on our history than any shared interests. A few years ago, I had a death in the family that was very traumatic and this friend completely supported me and talked me through a very dark time.\n\nNow that I am finally settled into my career, I have more time to devote to my personal passions and am ready to channel my energy into some creative projects of my own. I mentioned this in conversation with my friend. In a later conversation, my friend announces he has a great idea and thinks we should collaborate and write music together and try to get it published. I felt really uncomfortable with the idea and just tried to change the subject, but he's brought it up in subsequent conversations and seems to be really excited about the prospect. He's already dreamed up our success as a songwriting duo and has thought about how good I would be it. This friend is not even into music and I feel kind of insulted. I tried to escape the conversation by saying that it's something I would like to pursue on my own, but that was a lie.\n\nI do want to collaborate with someone else I know and have even started a tentative project. This person also has a degree in music and although I've never worked with him in a professional capacity, I know from our personal dealings that he is reliable, hard working, and very creative.\n\nI feel my old friend will feel betrayed if he finds out I am working with someone else, and may even feel like I stole HIS idea. He was there for me when I really needed it, but I don't think it's a good idea to try to mix \"business\" with friends in this particular case. I still feel torn though like I should humor him and maybe try to collaborate on something with him just for fun, but I am honestly not interested in diverting any time or effort into something my heart is not in. I am also afraid it might kill our friendship completely due to our very different habits and work ethic. Am I an asshole?",

What happened was my husband and I used the free trial from Hulu for Live TV without telling her and then Hulu tried to charge her early for it. She called me screaming about it. I was supposed to tell her and that was my fault for not doing so and I apologized and told her we would pay her back the money for it because it was my fault. She said not to worry about it because the charge was reversed (because the trial wasnâ€™t over, Hulu messed up).\n\nThe bigger fight started when she brought up getting an oil change for my car. Backstory on the car: I got an old car for my birthday from my grandparents that ran fine with my grandparents but basically as soon as I had it in my possession started to die. I could no longer afford to fix it so I started to think about getting a different car, because I was pregnant and would need it. I had no credit so I didnâ€™t know where to start looking. My mom convinced me to sell my car and use that money to put towards a brand new car. My husband (boyfriend at the time) told me this was a bad idea, I should get a used car. My mom said, â€œyou canâ€™t finance used cars.â€? I believed her for some dumb reason. At the dealership I was told I canâ€™t get the car in my name with no credit and I was ready to walk away but the sales guy and my mom convinced me to co sign. The conditions from my mom was that I let her see my daughter whenever she asked (which turned into every single day). So I let it happen.\n\nMy mom proceeded to threaten to take this car away a lot, but the hard truth was if she took it away, it would be harder for her to see my daughter (cause I would have to go north with my husband where he worked). She backed off every time. This time with the oil change, she demanded that we take it to the dealership to get it changed. It costs like $40, but I didnâ€™t have to pay this the first oil change cause it was free. My husband (who I pushed my mom into because I was just done talking to her) told her we couldnâ€™t  afford it and we would take it anywhere else for the oil change (we were in the process of moving as this was happening). She didnâ€™t like that answer and proceeded to insult my husband and call him a bad father. His response was â€œyour behavior makes it pretty hard for us to want you around our daughter.â€? I agreed with this response because she was being over the top. Her next message to me was â€œto lawyer upâ€? because my husband just threatened to take my daughter away from her. She then called me and said CPS was on the way and the whole time at our apartment as she is taking the car and a dining table (she gave it as a gift cause she was throwing it away) she is screaming that CPS was coming and they would definitely take my daughter away from me because â€œjust look at how you are dressed, you think you look like a fit mom?â€?\n\nI told this whole long story to give you guys an idea of how my mom is. She holds gifts over my head and will gladly take them away if I donâ€™t give her what she feels I owe her.\n\nAITA for not wanting her to give Christmas gifts to my daughter?\n\nTL;DR my mom is highly manipulative and holds gifts over my head and takes them away when she isnâ€™t happy. AITA for refusing any future gifts?",

From the start of our relationship, we agreed that either of us can have sex with someone else as long as weâ€™re informed about it beforehand. We both agree that there is a distinct difference between a romantic relationship and a sexual one, and so long as we together are the only ones in a romantic relationship, we donâ€™t care what the opposite person does with their body.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago where my boyfriend tells me â€œI think I cheated on youâ€?, and when I asked why he thought that, he said â€œYou know Jake? Yeah, so he and I had sex last weekâ€? (not his real name, obviously).\n\nI honestly thought how he worded that was really funny, and I told him I wasnâ€™t mad as long as he told me beforehand next time. He agreed, and weâ€™re completely fine.\n\nToday, I went to my coworker â€˜Nikkiâ€™ to tell her about the funny encounter (we tell each other a lot of things like this, so itâ€™s not exactly weird). She was confused until I reminded her that weâ€™re in an open relationship, and then agreed that it was pretty amusing.\n\nMy assistant manager, who weâ€™ll call â€˜Annaâ€™, was not so amused after overhearing this conversation. She told me to break up with my boyfriend, and when I said that it was okay and explained the open relationship, she told me that he was an asshole for cheating and that I was an asshole for thinking that it was funny.\n\nObviously, I know Iâ€™m not an asshole for finding the encounter humorous, but Iâ€™m starting to feel like an asshole for bringing it up in the first place.

I'm (20M) working as an apprentice in what I think is a high pressure environment and am able to take annual leave etc. Recently I've been working more than my 37+ hour week (not forced) and have just been feeling very burnt out. It happens. The past couple days I have been messaging my boss asking to take leave that day, apologising for the short notice. My boss has been fine with it.\n\nHere's the problem; I'm still living at home with my mum and brothers, and my mum comes in and asks \"are you not going to work again?\" to which I reply \"no, I didn't sleep properly and just feel burnt out\". She then proceeds to mention how she doesn't sleep but she still goes to work because \"she has to\". I turn around and fire back \" I'm not calling in sick, I'm taking my permitted leave. Are you saying I'm not allowed to take leave?\". She then leaves the room.\n\nHere's where the problem gets more complicated. Things at home mean that my dad's out of the picture and my mum works and looks after my younger brothers. I pay rent and help out when I'm around, and it's safe to say she is busy. I then feel like because I am off that I can't relax because she \"is\" working and doing stuff. It seems stupid I know but ultimately I don't want my mum to struggle and will help if she needs it. We've had these arguments before where she says that she still works when she doesn't feel like it etc. and she gets very annoyed when I take leave. But my leave is for me to do what I want with right? Just because I'm using my leave to sit around and relax my brain and body, doesn't mean I then need to help out more?\n\nShort story: Im taking leave (holiday) from work because I'm burnt out.

I've been now on maternity leave for more than six months (which is standard in my country) and I work 10 hours/week from home, my husband works full-time.\n\nOur baby is not sleeping through the night yet - he is waking up every 60-90 minutes for feeding. We are bottle-feeding him.\n\nI am quite frustrated by the fact that it's always me bottle-feeding him at night &amp; I'm always the one who gets up with him in the morning. \n\nI understand that I'm the one getting less sleep when my husband goes to work. We have a guest room and my husband occasionally sleeps there to get enough sleep. We both work in IT and he has always needed more sleep to be able to work than I did.  But it's the same during the weekends and it was the same even when we went for 2-week holidays - my husband refused to feed our baby at night at all &amp; he only got up with him once and bragged the whole day about how tired he is.\n\nI'm also a bit frustrated by the fact that during the weekends or evening when we are both at home, I'm still the one who is doing most work with the baby and around the house - it seems to me that it never happens that I relax, while my husband is taking care of the house or of the baby. The opposite (I'm doing stuff and he is relaxing) is happening all the time. \n\nWe talked about that I feel he is not thanking me enough for being sleep-deprived and letting him relax.

He complained that I often say that his help is not much compared with what I'm doing. I must say that he has a point in this, but it comes from my frustrations described above.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I was sick and had a bad cough.

He told me he though I'm finally thanking him and appreciating him, but I just talked about the fact how good I am.\n\nHe said it will be difficult for him to overcome how I hurt him.\n\n3 weeks later, and yesterday he told me he still can't believe me I'm being honest when I thank him for something, and that what I said 3 weeks ago hurt him very much.\n\nTL;DR: Husband never takes care of the baby during the night or in the morning.

But there's one thing that bothers me, and that's the fact that she really doesn't like it (gets upset) when I play video games. \n\nWe have alternating and crazy schedules so she usually opens and I work in the afternoon or close if I'm not at class. I generally try to schedule my game time around her schedule while she is either at work or asleep so that it doesn't bother her, and so I also get to hang out with her while she is awake. And when I say game time, it's not like 40 hours a week of gaming. I average 3-4 hours on nights that I get to play, which is generally every other night and excluding weekends. I explicitly reserve weekends for us to be together. So like, 10-12 hours a week. Some crazy nights I will pull a 7 hour night from 8pm-3am, but that is very rare. \n\nPersonally, I need my space to wind down. I work pretty much full time and I'm also a full time college student. I also try to go to the gym 4-5 times a week. I don't feel like in a serious relationship living together that you need to spend every second of down time with your SO, but that is just my opinion. \n\nI think what upsets her is that she really doesnt have any friends to hang out with or hobbies, so when I'm not home she's generally just watching Netflix, tidying up, or napping. I've invited her to learn how to play video games with me and even slapped together my old build so that she could try it out, but she hasn't even given it a shot.\n\nBut even though I try to not do my gaming when she is at home/awake, she still gets upset. She feels like I am just waiting for her to go to bed now so that I can play video games, which isn't the case. If I were to be gaming when she came home from work and something trivial wasn't done (a few dishes in the sink, laundry not put away, etc.) she would get upset that I chose to play video games instead of completing those tasks. That's fair, but on the flipside of that, I regularly come home to tasks not being completed while she is watching Netflix. I sort of feel like there are double standards that only really come out when it has to do with me gaming.\n\nSo the golden question, am I the asshole for wanting some alone time to play video games with friends? I don't feel like my gaming is getting in the way of our relationship. Personally I think that right now she is upset that we don't get to see each other as much as she wants to because of our wacky schedules, and is using video games as the reason for it.

It started out as friend with benefits and then the lines kind of blurred but we never took the next step. We had an amazing run in the beginning, but in the end there was a lot friction, hurt feelings, I noticed my personality changing in a way I didn't like at all (e.g. I started snapping at minor things while compromising on things that I shouldn't have) and when I couldn't take it anymore I told him we shouldn't see eachother anymore. I later reached out again to tell him that once our emotions have cooled down, I was open to try and work things out, to see if we could get our friendship back at least (I'm aware of how naive that sounds, but we honestly used to be great together and I wasn't ready to completely give up on that at that point in time). \nThat was about ten months ago. A couple weeks back he messaged me and we caught up on eachother's lives a bit. I gave him about a week of just chit chat to get accustomed to eachother again and things actually went pretty good until I told him that I'd like to actually talk about what went wrong last time, because I don't see this going anywhere unless we learn from our mistakes back then. He pretty much immediately shot me down, telling me that he's happy that I'm doing well but messaging me was a mistake and we shouldn't continue.\nTo get to the point of this AITA: he works at a really cool place that I never went to during the past ten months, out  of respect for his 'territory'. However during the time after he contacted me again, when we were exchanging pleasant chit chat, I made plans to got to an event there with some friends and last night we went there and had a great time. I didn't expect to actually see much of him, he doesn't work in the service area but more behind the scenes, but we did come across eachother a couple of time during which he either ignored me or honestly didn't notice me (I doubt that though, not noticing four people that you know just a couple of feet away from you seems a bit implausible to me). So if I judge the situation correctly, my presence did make him uncomfortable. And even after all that happened between us, part of me really wouldn't like him to come into work every day dreading to be confronted with memories and feelings he'd rather not deal with (by seeing me, I'm not planning any kind of active confrontations).

When I decided to switch universities last year and move back in with my parents I was giving up a very well paying, stable job as an au pair/tutor. I hadnâ€™t lived at home for about 4 years and in that time my mother and father made the decision to start fostering a 13 year old I will call Alice. I love Alice, I never had a girly kinda sister around since I had a very manly lesbian sister and my twin brother. Sheâ€™s hard working, sweet and caring, and none of this is directed towards her. \nTo make up for me not having a stable income anymore my parents decided to hire me as an au pair to Alice. \nMy hours are essentially 07:00-07:30 Monday till Friday, 14:00-16:00 Monday till Thursday and 14:00-20:00 on a Friday (She has choir in a town 40 minutes away and we get home late every Friday). This in between studying full time, and working another side job. \nThey pay me R3400 a month (about $244) which is supposed to include my fuel. I drive about 22km (about 14 miles) every day dropping and fetching her from school. Au Pairs in my country generally charge R50-75 an hour ($3.50-7.50) and R3/km ($0.20). \n\nNow that all of that is over let me start from about 15 minutes ago when I told my parents that I wanted to stay at my boyfriends house this weekend, starting on Thursday as I currently have off from school and he is house sitting this entire weekend, so he has no way of visiting me. My mother freaked saying that who would look after Alice on Friday, as she is also on break and therefor doesnâ€™t have school on Friday either. I stood there flabbergasted as my mom berated me about how if I was her client back in the old town I would not treat her like this and that I should look after Alice this Friday. I walked out of the room absolutely furious that she would speak to me like that. If she wanted me to look after Alice she could have asked nicely and I would have said yes and gone through to my boyfriend Friday afternoon instead. \n\nShe brought in business a o I decided to handle this as cleanly and business-like as possible. After some serious calculations I figured out that my parents were not only underpaying me (R35 an hour/$2.50) but also grossly misusing me. So Iâ€™ve decided to propose I charge them what they should be paying me, including overtime for looking after my sister this entire week. Since I only work from 14:00, that would include an extra 6 hours of work everyday that they need to pay me for, and I would discuss a new monthly rate that I should be rightfully paid. I am separating business from family and if they want to look for a cheaper option they can try but they will not find it, as I would be charging them the bottom rate for an au pair here. \n\nSo my question is, AITA for doing this to my parents? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

(She was constantly making up extravagant stories of her past and was really rude to her parents that she still lived with.) I was at a really vulnerable part in my life and decided to stay her friend because she was an escape from my shitty life. \n\nAnyways, I introduce her to my friends since she was new to the area. After Haley got close to them she turned them all on me. She constantly fed them lies until they didnâ€™t like me anymore.\n\nI cut Haley out of my life immediately and figured it was good that she helped me figure out who my fake friends were. She showed up at my house unannounced a couple times begging me to be her friend again but I always had my sister answer the door because I thought Iâ€™d punch her if I answered. \n\nI was a lonely mess after all of this, convinced that everyone hated me. Haley really hurt me. I did some soul searching that year while I was alone. I realized I was so full of hate towards her that it was only bringing me down and I needed to forgive her for my own mental health. \n\nI messaged her saying that there was no hard feelings and I hoped she was doing okay. She insisted that we hang out and told me she did some soul searching too and she changed. Me being lonely, I said yes. \n\nWhen I met Haleyâ€™s boyfriend, Zack,  I realized I already knew him from middle school. Zack and I got along really well, better than Haley and I did and we became closer friends. He constantly confided in me that he wanted to break up with Haley every day. And Haley told me the same thing about Zack. They had a seriously fucked up relationship where they were constantly screaming at each other. \n\nAnyways they had an extra ticket to this music festival and begged me to go. Haley told me that she didnâ€™t wanna go alone with Zack cause sheâ€™d be annoyed the whole time and Zack told me the same thing about Haley.  I figured a free ticket is a free ticket and I went. \n\nAfter the concert we were all really drunk. We went back to the hotel room and Haley insisted that we have a threesome. We were all down and went for it. Although Zack was really hot, I wasnâ€™t that into Haley so I was really uncomfortable then Haley got uncomfortable too because her boyfriend was kinda just fucking me in front of her. She told him to stop, they starting having sex again, I felt weird and left the hotel room. \n\nZack came and found me after about 30 minutes and we walked to the parking garage. Anyways we had sex. \n\nI feel like Haley deserved what she got and I wouldnâ€™t have had sex with Zack if they didnâ€™t insist on having a threesome in the first place.

            "input": "**The backstory.**\n\nI am dealing with an ex-wife of 10 years who has a history of mental illness/issues. I have also proven on several occasions that she has lied on a variety of things. She will say that her car has broken down so she can't take our child to school, only for it to work so she can go to a job interview later that day (with my child). She has told me that one of our friends was in a car accident and that I needed to watch our child so that she could visit her; only to see that friend post on Facebook 30 minutes later. She has told the government that I left both her and my child (it was a mutual separation) so that she would be bumped up on the list to get government assistance. She has also admitted to lying about some serious allegations about other ex-husbands because she was mad at them. So overall, everything she says I have to take with a grain of salt.\n\nNow, roughly a few weeks ago, I suggested keeping him on some of her days until she gets her life a bit more adjusted. This would have reduced her from 14 days to 6 days a month (every other weekend). Her response was to threaten to take me to court. She wasn't going to let me boss her around anymore and she will ensure that she has a relationship with her kid (which implied I was trying to prevent that). I actually 100% want them to have a relationship, which is why I follow the visitation schedule rigorously.\n\nOn top of that, I am engaged to someone who really doesn't like her continuous involvement in our lives. We are completely independent from my ex and almost never rely on her for any assistance; yet every month or so we are approached to accommodate her for whatever reason that I'm never sure is true. In a lot of cases, we end up accommodating; but I am trying to stop that because it's very fair to say that my ex shouldn't have so much direct involvement in our lives - especially if she is lying to us.\n\nOur visitation setup is that while I actually have primary custody, we personally have a 50/50 setup right now. When I consulted a divorce lawyer roughly two years ago, he told me that because this 50/50 setup has been the norm for years, she could take me to court, accuse me of being unfair and the judge could side with her. I have since started capturing documentation incase I ever do go back to court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The situation**.\n\nToday I got a text from my ex saying her drinking problem is getting out of hand and she wants me to take him for a week while she attends AA to get her problem handled. He is supposed to visit her tonight and has made no reference to her drinking problems until this morning.\n\nHer text implied she has not started it yet, despite having all week to do so. She has had the past three days and will have the next three days free to attend. I also believe AA is not a one-week-and-done situation and is an ongoing process, meaning she will need to schedule her meetings on nights where she does not have our child, anyways.\n\nHer family has expressed to me that they do think she has a drinking problem, but because of her history of lying, I'm not convinced that today's claim is legit and is actually being used as a reason to get out of parenting tonight.\n\nTo add to this, my fiance's father is an alcoholic. So if this turns out to be a false claim, that is *really* going to rub her the wrong way. All things considered, I've found it best to err on the side of being skeptical.\n\nSo, hopefully I've been able to articulate that this is a complex situation. I don't want to dismiss a potential serious claim; but I also don't want to enable more lying using serious claims like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Will I be the asshole?**\n\nI am planning on telling her that this is a serious issue that will take longer than a week. Therefore, I suggest she keep seeing him and maintaining their relationship while visiting AA on her off-nights and keeping her drinking in-check on her nights with my child. Otherwise, I will be willing to go back to my proposed visitation schedule from a few weeks ago from here on out and not just for a few weeks. ",

No problem with that in itself.\n\nMy flatmate is a great friend of mine - we spend a lot of time together, cook together, share shopping, etc, and I love this arrangement and I know he does either. \n\nThe issue is that this girl has been staying for an increasingly ridiculous amount of time. The first couple of times she has stayed for reasonable amounts of time that I have no issue with, such as long weekends. However, the last couple of times she came down she stayed for 5 days, which though I wasn't too happy about I let slide as it wasn't too different to her usual 3 or 4, but the next time she stayed for a total of 10 days/9 nights. \n\nI was livid, and ended up feeling forced out of my own flat for the majority of that time. Most of the reason I was pissed off was that she was eating my food, drinking my drink etc, without offering a penny towards me, or even a simple thanks! Personally I would offer money or at least bring a bottle of wine as a thank you, at the very least say thanks, if I was even staying at someones for the night let alone the next 10 days.\n\nIt doesn't help that we don't really get on either; she is jealous of the relationship that my flatmate and I have, and even though there is nothing romantic about it at all, she seems to try her best to keep us apart the whole time she is at our flat. I wouldn't say I was jealous of her but her presence does irk me; I'm a creature of habit and her being there fully disrupts my meal routine as my flatmate and I can't cook for each other as normal. However, I stress that this last point wouldn't bother me if she wasn't so rude to me in my own home. \n\nAnyway, he didn't tell me about her coming until the day before she did, when I told him that she wasn't welcome for that long in our flat, especially not without asking me or any of my other flatmates about it. An extra person in our already small flat was a lot to handle, and it meant that we had to have predrinks in our bedrooms/eat in our bedrooms as we didn't feel comfortable being a 3rd party to them. He basically told me it was none of my business.\n\nProblem is, I couldn't just let it go - I'm a student so I'm not exactly wealthy, I certainly didn't want to fund somebody else. My flatmate promised me we'd work out something regarding money for the food she'd eaten. \n\nAfter the 10 days elapsed, it transpired neither of them were planning on giving me any money. He said they'd done the groceries, but they had only bought at most around 10 pounds worth of veg, most of which they'd eaten. He told me this was fair and couldn't do any more as he was low on cash. My argument is if neither of them could afford the extra money, she shouldn't have come for 10 days.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Before uni I dated another guy for about 7 months who I'll call Jay, we broke up because he was always travelling and it was hard to maintain long distance so it was better to be friends. \n\nLately I've been going through a lot of personal stuff; I've battled with anxiety since I was young and its been really kicking into high gear lately, my family is planning a big move that will either result in an excruciating commute to school or me having to live on campus or find a roommate, I just lost a friend of 7 years due to a major falling out and I don't really have anyone else besides my current bf and my ex. \n\nMy bf Ben has a really intense major and works on the weekends. He's usually the first person that I go to when I need to vent or talk things through, but he's super busy with work and studying so I don't want to bother him. Especially right now because we have midterm exams. My ex Jay is really busy as well, he works in music and is constantly travelling. We don't even see each other as exes, we really just see each other as long time friends. I usually only confide in him if Ben is busy and can't reply for a while.  \n\nLately Ben has been more distant than usual, because of exams and studying or whatnot. He cancelled our scheduled datenight to study and doesn't text as much except to hear about my day and say goodnight (which I'm not angry about, I understand he has to study and he still makes sure to talk to me at least a little every night). I needed to talk about some stuff, just a mini rant to get things off my chest. I didn't want to bother Ben while he was studying, so I texted Jay instead. I ranted to him and I felt better. Later during our usual \"how was your day\" convo, I told Ben that I was having a rough day but I felt better after talking to Jay. This made him upset, and he said I could've come to him if I was upset, and I should've before talking to Jay. I said I didn't want to interrupt his studying and said I would go to him first next time. We didn't get into a huge argument about it, he's a really chill guy and we just carried on with our convo for a little bit before he went to bed. \n\nThe way I see it is both of them are super busy, but Ben doesn't reply until the evening and Jay replies almost instantly, and I don't want to be stewing over something all day when I can get it off my chest that moment. They're also different in how they react: Jay asks questions and gives advice, while Ben just says \"that sucks, just go relax.\" I usually always text Ben first and only text Jay if I don't get a reply, but this time I just skipped the middleman. The only reason was really because I didn't want to bother Ben and I knew I would get actual responses from Jay instead of \"sleep it off.\" \n\nAITA for confiding in my ex before my boyfriend?",

So eating out isnâ€™t really in our budget. Other things, like special crafts or classes that my mom wants to do, she will pay for.

Sometimes itâ€™s literally the question of: do we look like an asshole and be the only offspring to not pay our meal, do we charge it to the credit card, or do we overdraft our banking account?\nor like just today, my mom texted us asking if we wanted to do some candy making craft. I would never go make candy on any occasion except that itâ€™s my moms birthday and she wants us to al be together and make candy.

We sold our first house and have created a bit of a buffer for the first time in ten years.

My entire family is very dysfunctional, essentially we're \"triple traumatized\".  My mother was raised by a Holocaust survivor, was verbally/emotionally abused by one of her husbands, and had to deal with my abused. I myself was verbally/emotionally abused as well, and sexually abused at school. That screwed my mom up as well as myself. Given the constant fighting and screaming I had to deal with growing up, I just detached myself. I do not have the same attachments to family that most people do. My primary focus in life is academic/career success: nothing comes before that, including family. I understand why she is the way she is, but I just don't care anymore.\n\nMy mother is neurotically overprotective. I'm a senior in college, and she has shown she doesn't see me as anything more than a child. Every winter, she has a mental breakdown. She thinks I'm going to die when it gets remotely cold out. I shit you not, she invoked the memory of the *holocaust* when I didn't wear a hat going out one time. \n\nAnother thing she does is send me little \"reminders\" over text very frequently. She reminds me of basic stuff that a senior in college, or anyone of my age, should know how to do. Sleeping, washing your face, etc. *I know to do all of these things*. I am not inept. I'm finishing undergrad early entirely out of my own drive.  I've told her time and time again that when she does this, it's belittling and demeaning. She fakes an apology, but then she turns right around and does it again the second she gets worried. These are just two examples.\n\nI've lost my temper at her before. I don't like it when I do that, and I'm working on it in therapy. But I feel like she just never listens to me. No matter what I say, or the manner I say it in, anything I say to her just goes in one ear and out the other. I love my mother, and I'm grateful for everything she's done for me. But I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of being belittled. If it takes cutting her out of my life to get her to stop, I have no problems with doing so the moment I'm financially able to. ",

Iâ€™m not just some fat dude who calls himself a â€œpowerlifterâ€? to justify my eating habits). \n\nI have to eat. A lot.

I also logged into Monikas account (I have a habit of watching people enter passwords, I think I know those of all coworkers by now), and commited all the work Monika had marked as completed but not yet commited (the stuff she usually lets Sina commit). \n\nThis didn't go unnoticed by the boss, and he angrily came asking why so much of Monika's tasks where flagged as Sinas and if that was the reason why Sina was always late with hers. It didn't end well for Monika (partly because of me and another coworker who said that we often saw Monika carry documents over to Sina) and she got a warning from the boss that she could forget a promotion and might lose her job if she does it again. Sina on the other hand got a raise.\n\nTL;DR: A coworker was being a bitch and pushing her mistakes on someone else. I exposed her in a sneaky way and made sure she'll not become my boss to avoid future trouble with her.\n\nAITA for doing this?",

Would I be the asshole for suggesting to my friend to stop being friends with his ex? So here are the key players, (Not their real names!)\n\nDerrick = My friend\n\nKaren = My friends ex\n\nHellen= Me and Derrick's friend (Very bad at supporting, or comforting people IMPORTANT LATER)\n\nMaddie = Karen's friend\n\nMe = ~~A magical wizard from the future~~ Me!\n\n**The relationship:**\n\nNow it started off great! They really both cared for each other. Then, she started to ignore him in every other class but lunch. Okay weird but... Then the event happened, It was a normal Friday I gotten home and started playing video games, then Derrick called the group chat crying, Karen had messaged him that she wanted to break up, since she liked Maddie (Maddie was a jerk too Derrick mind you,) My friend Hellen, couldn't handle this so she left the call, leaving me to comfort him. Derrick is a nice kid, he kept saying it wasn't Karen's fault for breaking up with him, that it was his!\n\nNow present day Derrick still kinda of has a crush on her. She caused him problems. But, funny thing is, this wasn't caused by the breakup. This happened months after it. But he continued to be friends with her, which, I am guessing may have caused this. Why? Because relationships with your ex can be terrible! He still has a crush on her, since he has every class with her and sits right next to her. Imagine seeing someone you were so close to having a relationship with dating someone else, or just being stuck in a friend zone with someone you love..\n\nSo Reddit WIBTA for suggesting my friend that it might be better for him to stop being friends with his ex? I might just be acting over protective, but I just want him to be happy!",

            "input": "Sorry for the long post; it's complicated. \n\nI've been friend's with C for many years. I ran into some difficult times in a housing situation, and C and his girlfriend K offered to rent me a room. C had been dating K for about a year, and I was good friends with K as well. I was weary about cohabitating with friends, but they practically begged me to do it. We set some ground rules, rent cost etc, and one rule being that they were 100% ok with me having  girls over or whatever, (tenant/landlord law in the state forbids landlords from preventing a tenant from having guests anyway.) \n\nFast forward a few months, I had to have knee surgery which put me off of work for 14 weeks. In this time I needed an incredible amount of help getting around ( I couldn't drive either) and the girl I was seeing was amazing at helping me. She would stay over on days when I had early morning doctor of PT appointments and help me whenever she could.\n The problem was, K did not like this girl. K is the kind of friend who thinks she knows what's best for you, so even though she had no discernable reason to hate her, she just did. One week this girl had to stay over about 4 nights in a row, to help me getting to appointments and we were also working on a large charity project for a children's hospital ( this was around the holidays)\nI should note that this girl didn't shower here, we didn't cook or eat their food, drink their drinks or hang out in common areas. I/We literally stayed in the room I rented the entire time. \nAbout a week later I get this text from K:\n\n\"Hey, I don't have a lot of friends, but the ones I do have, I value a lot in my life. Part of the reason I probably don t have a lot of friends is because I don't like to bullshit or be fake. If there's something bothering me, I like to talk about it and resolve it. I know you've told me you've had bad experiences with roommates and I have too, trust me, but I really did mean it when I said that we will never have an issue, because we are all good friends. \nI'm going to be upfront because I don't expect anything less from you. Get your dick wet...i love sex and I don't feel like you should be deprived. But can (girl) just come less? She's there every single day, and we didn't really sign up for 2 roommates. My sisters will be here from dec 23rd till January 11th, and unfortunately we only have two bathrooms, so could she also please not come when they are here? \"\n\nI responded \"ok\" but I was actually hurt a lot by this. \nLike.. being accused of trying to move this girl in, when she had no property here and didn't cost them anything was insulting. Also they know I can't walk or drive around due to my surgery, yet assume she's just staying over for sex. Not to mention I felt like if I rent a room somewhere, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. \nI couldn't argue the point because they're the ones helping me out with housing, and I didn't want to put my friend C in the middle of this, but I felt like this was only said because K hated this girl. I started looking for a new place to stay immediately but it took 6 weeks. In this 6 weeks neither K nor C, or her visiting sisters would even acknowledge my existence. No one would talk to me or even make eye contact with me. Not to mention my birthday was during the time her sisters were over which made it incredibly lonely sitting in my room like a ghost in the attic. \nI moved out and haven't spoken to K at all since. C contacted me later asking me to apologize to K for \"getting weird and ignoring her\" after she sent that text. The thing is, I couldn't do it. I didn't want to be her friend anymore. Unfortunately it also cost me my friendship with C. \nTLDR: I rented a room with my friend and his girlfriend. They agreed before hand they're cool with me having girls over. Had a girl over too often due to needing help with injury/Charity work. Friend's girlfriend hated this girl asked me to not have her come over so often/ anymore. I felt like if I rent a room, I should be able to sleep with whoever I want in that room. Both friendships with friend and his girlfriend are destroyed. AITA? ",

            "input": "Wondering if I'm being an asshole right now, even though I don't mean to be. \n\nI have been seeing this girl for a few weeks. She is amazing - intelligent, hilarious, and she's a great listener and conversationalist. For the first week, I was head over heels. \n\nWe've been spending a lot of time together. I'm an introvert and prefer one-on-one hangouts, but she texts me all day, every day, saying misses me or asking to hang out. Another problem is our budding relationship is almost.. overly physically intimate. I  know that that sounds like an absolutely crazy thing to complain about, but I can't get her to sit still for 5 minutes without kissing my neck or trying to get me to making out with her. That is not an exaggeration. Sometimes I just want to chill and enjoy her company and conversation. It's overwhelming.\n\nI'm not some hot model someone should be falling head over heels for. I'm not even a *super* sexual person... I enjoy sex, but have had abusive relationships in the past that make a lot of physical contact a bit stressful. It takes me time to feel comfortable with someone.\n\nThe most confusing part is that I've tried to tell her this. She told me she wanted me to always tell her whenever I was uncomfortable or needed space. Each time I've said so, she looks extremely hurt. If I told her every time I was uncomfortable/needed space, I'd be hurting her feelings all the time. Every other sentence she says is something about how much she likes me, or how handsome I am, or how obsessed she is with me. (She is a successful adult person, haha. She isn't sitting at home staring at a picture of me.)\n\nI don't want to hurt her feelings. Who asks someone else to kiss them and compliment them less? I'd be crushed if someone said that to me, but I really can't explain just how much of it is happening, and how uncomfortable it makes me. I'm not good at attention.\n\nThe last part makes me feel especially asshole-ish. She has an adorable dog, who is allowed into her bed. I don't automatically have a problem with that - the issue is that her bed is always *coated* in dog hair. I don't like being naked and coated in dog fur while trying to have sexytimes. On top of that, the dog (who is very big) whines if not allowed on the bed, which results in us trying to do the deed around it. I just feel weird fucking her with my thigh pressed up against her dog's ass. How am I supposed to say that without sounding like an asshole? She loves her dog more than life itself. How do I ask her to wash her sheets without sounding like a dick? Do I buy her a lint-roller? (Kidding.)\n\nTLDR: Amazing girl is super, *super* into me. Like, intensely so. Can't go five minutes without trying to make out with me. How do I ask her to back off without hurting her feelings? She asked me to be open but gets really sad whenever I do so. I was super into her but am getting overwhelmed. I don't want to sleep in dog hair. Might be shallow.",

Didn't want go to the doctor appointment he only went maybe 3times. I was okay with that. Then he started make comments how I'm not the same anymore to how immature I Have Become ect. He try to feel the bady move but said he thought it was weird. He started called the baby a fetus. As time when on we to find if we have boy or girl he just look at the screen with my parents. We found out it was a boy and my dad was so excited but when he ask my ex how he feels it all he said im happy and that was it. When I was 7 months things turn for the wrost he broke up with me and told me I could stay but made it sound like I was unwelcome and started hang with anther girl. So I couldn't handle it so I moved back with my parents and he was okay with it. We made agree in talking that we keep how my son name would be after him to he how to make effort no matter what to be in my son his life like call to visit ect. Well after I move out he change again and start not doing what he said he would do. Call maybe ever now then ask about how my son is. There times I had to beg him. Then he got into relationship with that girl after 2 weeks with this girl was my friend too and I warn her about him. Same thing kept happen and he told me that when he see my son every other weekend when he born. Well that didn't sit right with me but at the same time didn't register (note this whole time I was depressed and upset about the whole thing) but I went with it. I still have beg him to ask how the baby is. He would tell me he love the baby and be the there for him but his actions was telling me different.  He told me to call or text when the baby with going to come. Well my dad told me if he not going to full effort now then he won't when my son is born that he shouldn't have right to baby at all. As my son about came  he was there band the girl was too which I told him I didn't want to her because I felt she betrayed me as her friend tell me she got my back so on. The tell I was have contractions more more he told me that why i call him even though the baby wasn't here yet. He brother was there all excited about it. him on the other hand act all emotionless. Few hours past I had my son. He held him smile my mom ask you thinking. His exact response i feel like im staring at myself. That was it. Minutes past and he told me I have to accept his girlfriend into my son's life even if I don't like it. I just look at him didn't say words my heart broke even more (note I was tired and exhausted after give birth) then he went back home for work. Later texting my mom that he will take care of the maternity test so he can be on the birth certificate( note he wasn't there when I did all the paperwork for the birth certificate) when my son was a week old hey I've been text me saying I want to see my son but he's bringing his girl I told him no I feel uncomfortable about her comeing but he can come see him. He said no I want her to be there so I just take him to the Park. I said no it to cold outside. He still insisted take him to the park so his girlfriend could see him. I was upset I thought I deal with it because my hormones were going all wacky. So my mom told him to stop act like she his mom that this shouldn't be about her but my son. He said okay then I didn't hear very much from him ever now and how the baby. Then he text mom mom that he got the maternity test ready and me and my mom should go there now. My mom got a little bit aggravated and told him we're not going to always jump every time you say jump. ( note I kind of stopped talking to him because he kept guilt-tripping me and making me sound like I was a horrible person the only time I talk him if it's about my son) He didn't respond the day then saying he comeing over I said okay I waited 6 hour he didn't show then text to me saying something came up. This happen 3 more time less he ask how my son was he kept making up excuses I begged him over and over to come see his son. Nothing work it was always a excuse. I finally got tired of it and getting more more depressed so blocked him on Facebook been changed my number he send my mom ask why i block him when he should have already knew. Now it's been almost 2 years and he still has not made any effort. I Heard it Through the Grapevine he doesn't even talk about me or my son anymore. Him and the girl broke up he move back with his parents that what I heard and now he talk about my son again even though he hasn't made any effort to come see him after he has a girlfriend again. Did I make the right choice? I was trying save son from heart brake because I seen so my many of my friends go through the same situation with their parents and I didn't want that for him I wanted him to have a father to come see him all the time and be there for him not just wait when ever his father feels like it. I begged him to come see his son in past I did everything but it felt like it was never enough for him. It felt like was always bad person to him it seemed. ",

This is something the entirety of my family agrees on, with the exception of my dad of course. One of those little pointless things heâ€™s decided to control in my life is packing my lunch for school. The main reasons I have a problem with this are because:\na) The food in his house is often far past its expiration date and I donâ€™t feel comfortable eating stuff from there unless Iâ€™ve checked the date. I have been packed moldy food several times before\nb) The food he does pack just doesnâ€™t taste good. Iâ€™ll force myself to eat a bite or two, but almost all of it gets thrown away. I donâ€™t want to waste food. Iâ€™ve asked him to pack different foods, but he never does.\nc) I literally donâ€™t have room to carry it.\n\nIâ€™ve asked him several times to just let me pack the lunch if he wants me to take a lunch that badly, to which he always vehemently refuses and yells at me about. Iâ€™ve asked him several times to, if he wants to pack a lunch, to just ask me first so that I can make a little more room in my bag and get a word in about what food heâ€™s having me take. He always says heâ€™ll ask, but I always walk downstairs to him with a fully packed lunch ready for me, and Iâ€™ll ask him again to just let me know before hand. Itâ€™s a never ending cycle.\nSo this morning, I walked downstairs to see a fully packed lunch on the table. I told my dad I wouldnâ€™t take it and explained how I had asked him time and time again to just let me know first. He got angry and started yelling about how unappreciative I am and starting dissing how my mom never packs me lunch (divorced parents) and went on about how itâ€™s his house, so heâ€™ll pack me lunch if he so pleases. I didnâ€™t yell back, I just went upstairs and quietly left afterwards. Honestly, had he just asked beforehand, I wouldâ€™ve taken it, but he didnâ€™t. Heâ€™s still mad at me for not taking the lunch.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to take the lunch my dad packed for me to school?",

Also, English is not my first language so my apologies if I mess up.\n\nSome background info: I'm a bit of a recluse. I work from home and love love love it. But, there are times that I don't have to leave the house for a few days. Not that I don't want to, I just don't have to. As I live in an apartment building and the mailboxes are all downstairs, I don't check my mail every day. I rarely get mail anyway, everything is digital these days. I only get spam and some local newspaper. And mail addressed to the previous owners.\n\nI bought this house a few years ago, in August, and moved in in November 2012. The previous owners were somewhere in their 80s and moved to an assisted living facility about a mile away. It's on the way to the cinema and my parents.\n\nAfter I moved in I received a considerable amount of mail for them. I would collect it and when I went to the movies about twice a month I would drop it off in their mailbox at the front desk.\n\nEvery once in a while I would receive a mourning card for them. I didn't open them, I don't even think I'm allowed to, but I would jump in my car and drop it off, because I wasn't sure when the card had arrived. This happened a few times in the first few years. Sometimes it was late and I would wait until the next morning to drop it off.\n\nSo two years ago. I had been living there for 4,5 years. I received two mourning cards within a few weeks. I dropped the first one off immediately. The second one... well crap. Something went wrong. I put it in my bag to drop it off but I wasn't feeling well and got distracted. I suck. I spent the weekend on the couch like a coughing corpse and totally forgot about it. It took me three days to drop it off. And I didn't even know when the card had arrived in the first place. Shit.\n\nI dropped it off in the morning and the next day I received a letter. From the former owners of this house. They were mad as hell, because they had missed the funeral. Apparently the funeral was on the morning that I had dropped off the card. Oh shit. They asked me why I hadn't given them a call so they could have picked up the card (I don't even have their number. Luckily they didn't have my number either otherwise they would have called me. Dodged a bullet there). They were upset and condescending and calling me irresponsible and selfish.\n\nI didn't do it on purpose and it had been over 4,5 years since I moved in, why in the name of fuck do I still get your mail? What if I was on vacation or in the hospital or god knows what? But I still feel guilty, although my friends and family tell me not to, especially after their shitty letter. There was some more correspondence after this in which they acted like five year olds, but it doesn't change the fact that I was late delivering the card.",

Iâ€™ve tried to be nice but Katie is racist/homophobic. I have heard her use the n-word and call people fxg and dxke among others. Each time I hear it I correct her nicely but she always does it again. One of the guys at our lunch table is gay, too.\n\nShe lies all the time and talks about really inappropriate stuff; weâ€™ll be talking about music or something and sheâ€™ll say her uncle went to jail for molesting her cousin (yes that happened and it was as awkward as it sounds).\n\nA few days ago at lunch one of our other friends was showing everyone the photo book her boyfriend made her, and while no one was looking, Katie drew mustaches/glasses/crazy hair on their faces in a couple photos and thought it was hilarious. If that isnâ€™t bad enough she refused to apologize and our other friend was so upset.\n\nAfter the picture incident I told her we needed to take a break while she figured out how to be a good friend. She laughed and said I sounded like an episode of Daniel Tiger (idk what that even means) and walked away, and then yesterday she tried to sit at our table at lunch. Everyone stopped talking and looked at me, so I said â€˜can we help you, Katie?â€™ and she said â€˜no, why?â€™ to which I replied â€˜I told you that we need to take a break, so you need to find someplace else to sit at lunchâ€™.\n\nShe went and TOLD THE VICE PRINCIPAL that we were excluding her because sheâ€™s in hospitality. VP then told me I needed to be nice to Katie because she doesnâ€™t have many friends. I told VP everything I just wrote and she said â€˜I know sheâ€™s socially awkward but you still have to be nice to herâ€™.\n\nToday she was sitting at a different table where no one was talking to her, and one of the guys at my table asked if we were maybe being a little harsh since none of us really talk to her outside school either. But then everyone mostly agreed it was nice to have a normal lunch for a change.\n\nSo.... AITA?",

            "input": "So this is not my usual account, as I don't want people to know that my marriage is on the rocks.  I'd like to start by giving you a rundown of our history so far, so you can get a general idea of what each of us are dealing with. This will be long. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nMy husband and I have been married just over 5 years. What I didn't know when we got married was that my husband had a gambling issue. He hid it very well when we were dating and for a good few months after we got married, but then as we started living together there were aspects that didn't add up. Less than a year into the marriage he admitted that he had a gambling issue.\n\nMy husband is paid weekly, and his pay is fairly high compared to my own. He earns about 75k per year, whereas I earn about 60k now. To compound on the pay gap, I was a student when we first met (husband is a lot older), and worked restaurant jobs during the first two years of marriage. Then I moved onto an admin job, and now I am working in my field of choice. It is entirely fair to say that my husband has consistently earned more than me. I estimate that if I had brought in about 110k over the last 5 years, my husband had earned around 200k or a little more.\n\nMy issue is that my husband had never, not once, missed a week of gambling. Each payday he is in a pub or at the casino, gambling. The smallest amount from memory is about $200.00 per week. When he is feeling especially addicted, he will literally blow his entire week's wage on pokie machines, and then ask me for part of my wages too. This has happened more times than I can count. \n\nDuring our marriage, I have managed to compile approximately $30k in personal loan debts and $42k for a car loan. He has asked money from every member of his family, to the point they will no longer lend him money. He gambles every tax return away. He has gambled about $8k of personal loan debts. We have since sold the car, so I have about 30k in debts owing in my name.\n\nI interpret this to mean that my husband is not bringing in enough money into the relationship, regardless of how much he is earning, as he is spending a significant chunk on gambling. \n\nMeanwhile, I generally try to scrimp. I cut my hair once a year, I never do my nails, I don't buy clothes unless I absolutely need it. I feel that even if I have earned less, I have brought into the relationship as much, or arguably even more, than my husband. \n\nMy husband does not agree. He is adamant that he could not have spent as much as I say he has. We fight over money every payday. I was patient and kind the first year or so, until my personality started getting ugly, and frankly abusive, towards my husband. In my defense, I genuinely have never shouted at another person in my life. My husband is the only person I lose my temper with. We are now at the point where I will be screaming all sorts of abuses at him at the top of my lungs. I feel like if I don't, I will die or implode from stress.\n\nI am now at a point where I inform him on almost a weekly basis that I will be leaving him. He is now immune to my threats, understandably, but it's like an addiction I cannot stop. My husband now informs me that I am not 'loyal' for saying such things. That we should be sticking it out through thick and thin, and he is hurt that I would say such things.\n\nLast week we agreed that each of us would bring in an equal amount into the relationship, and the rest of our money we would spend as we please, whether we are gambling or doing our hair. He was good last week. However, this week, he claims not to have received his wage, that their system had been down, and he would give me the money when he received it. He was supposed to have been paid on Wednesday. It is now Thursday night, and he says he will receive it tomorrow. He asked to lend me $50, he just wanted a drink at the pub, he will pay me back tomorrow along with our fixed amount. I agreed. An hour later he called me and asked me to lend him another 100. He will pay me back tomorrow, he says. Through 5 years of his working at this company, his pay has been delayed once. I therefore informed him that I find this hard to believe, and if he showed me his bank account and confirmed that he had not received his wage, I will give him the 100. He flat out refuses and asks me why I cannot wait until tomorrow, if I just wait, I will know. I once again blew my top and screamed at him. \n\nI now know that because I screamed at him, he will be upset, and feel justified in spending everything he has and blame me because I could not wait one day.\n\nAITA for 1. asking my husband to show me his bank account in the first place and 2. losing my temper when he didn't?\n\n(I think people will want to know this - why do I keep giving him money? He will not stop asking until I give it to him. If I lock myself in a room at midnight so I can sleep for work the next day, he will bang on the door until I open it and give him money. He has hacked into my bank account a few times to take my money without my consent.)\n\nTL;DR: husband has been gambling significant amounts of money since early on in our 5 year marriage. I became suspicious that he was lying to me today and asked him to show me his bank account as proof, and screamed at him when he wouldn't.",

She is a bit self centered and is a massive FOMO (Fear of missing out) most of the time she will try to do everything with you or try to get everyone to do the same thing.

I mentioned to someone that I never want to see her again. They were shocked that someone who is so close to her family wouldnâ€™t feel the same way about her grandma. They also thought I was being a little harsh when my grandmaâ€™s never been anything but nice to me, and said I should give her the comfort of her favorite grandchild before she dies.

She might just have the kind of Debbie Downer personality that's a bit overboard at the moment. \n\nWe meet 3 years ago at work. She would often complian about everything.. Work, the country we live in, other people etc. \n\nThen, her best friend left our work place, and after a few weeks of her trying to catch up with her, the friend sends her a text saying that she didn't want to have anything to do with the old work place because she had had such bad experiences there, and just cuts ties with her. She was devastated.\n\nWe become closer..best friends, tell everything to each other kind of thing. \n\n2 years ago she started having doubts about her relationship and complaints that she does everything her boyfriend wants and never gets what she wants. Every time we go out, day or night , he calls , insisting for her to come home.. \n\n1 year and 1/2 ago she meets this guy at work and ends up having a crush.. they see each other twice for coffee.. but nothing happens from there on. Then 1 year ago she meets another guy.. this was worse.. for the first couple of months they declare love for each other... But she ends up saying she will never leave her boyfriend, so ended it with the guy.. she never physical cheated because they live in different countries..but emotional cheating in my POV.\n\n it gets complicated. This guy is super depressed, is in therapy, had has a history of attempting suicide in the past. He's also the type that uses that to guilt people in to things. He's super in love with her, and she just wants to be friends, says they have an amazing connecting, and he's family.. so they still talk everyday.. she hides a lot of the communication from her boyfriend, because she knows it's too much to be acceptable. But since he's so depressed she seems even more  Depressed from being connected to him and enabling this friendship. \n\nI can't help but judge... I've told her she shouldn't keep contact with him after their involvement and because he's still In love and won't be able to get over her if they still have contact. I've only said something over hours and hours of her complaining that he cries a lot because they're not together. \n\nHer boyfriend might not be great.. but I don't think he deserves this.. even if they re just friends now. \n \nWe used to have lunch everyday.. but I've avoided seeing her as much.. I schedule meetings at lunch time. When I do have lunch with her I'm always thinking \"this time will be better, this time she will be in a good mood\".. and then regret it later.\n\nShe used to have other friends, but I'm her only friend now. We used to go to breakfast Saturday morning when I was single. She's told  me she used to be happier because we would go for breakfast and have some laughs, and that now she has nothing in her life to cheer her up. She kind of made my feel guilty for her misery.. which I feel was unfair, and it's too much responsibility to be her only friend.\n\nI can't keep scheduling meetings and giving excuses... I don't like lying.. not even white lies.. but I also can't tell her I can't deal with her, I think it would devastate her.\n\nSo I've blew her off several times by saying I want to have lunch alone, because I need some time - this is true and has happened in the past, she knows I'm introverted and need less social time and has always respected that... But I think with time she will start to feel suspicious because I'm consecutively doing it... She's already asked me if anything is wrong and said I no. Not seeing her everyday has made me so much happier... But as a friend shouldn't I be there for her? Instead of just cutting her out because she's been having a bad time? AITA?\n\n \n",

Inches on the floor, completely soaked my mattress, water stains on my feather duvet and ruined a bunch of things I had stored under my bed. This happened about 2-3 times a week until mid-september (when the tenant above me moved out) and then would happen about twice a month until December (new tenants moved in).\n\nEach time it happened I'd call my landlord who would 'promise' to fix it. I honestly thought he was working as hard as he could to solve this problem. He would go into great detail about all the work he was doing to fix it. One week it was the tenant's sink above me, the next week it was his toilet, for a whole month it was raccoons eating away on the roof. In December I finally went up to the tenet above me and found out it was the shower. Instead of paying for me to stay in a hotel he had me and the new tenants above wait 2 weeks to fix the pipes. This means they had to go somewhere else to shower during that time.\n\nAnyway, I went home and he fixed the ceiling. This stopped the flooding and I was happy...until the next morning. I was woken up at 7am to insane amounts of noise. We're talking vibrations moving down my wall in my bedroom amounts of noise. I could hear everything they did and said: conversations, footsteps, doing their dishes, closing cupboards, shower running through the ceiling.\n\nAnyway, I'm guessing you can guess what happened. When he fixed the ceiling he put absolutely no soundproofing between their floor and my ceiling. It's their hardwood floor, a few feet of dead space and a 10x10 piece of drywall he nailed directly into the wood ceiling frames. Basically, he created a drum that amplifies everything they do throughout my apartment and causes the dishes in my kitchen cupboard to rattle when they walk in the right place.\n\nCue 2 months of my emailing the landlord and him promising to fix the ceiling. We'd set dates and nothing would happen. It took about 2 months for me to stop being an idiot and realize that he had no intention of ever fixing the ceiling so I gave my notice. During this time I've documented EVERYTHING.\n\nFinally, this weekend he nailed acoustic tiles to the ceiling after I told him that they had been keeping me up. When he fixed it, I came home to plaster dust completely covering my bed, duvet cover, floor, pillows. HE had been walking on my mattress while he did it because my duvet was messed up and there was plaster under it on the sheets. He had pushed my bed out of the way and destroyed my hamper and boxes that I use for shipping things I had kept at the end of my bed. I had to spend an hour dusting, sweeping and throwing out the insane mess he made. I was so upset and angry.\n\nSo, redditors, do you think I'd be the asshole? I'm absolutely seething in anger so I can't judge if this is irrational or not",

He asked me about the ring, and I told him I would prefer not to have an engagement ring and would rather we both pick out inexpensive bands together that we both put on at the wedding. He agreed with this and also said he doesn't need an expensive band for himself. I also told him that I don't need a proposal, but he told me he really wanted to surprise me with one and that he had been looking forward to it for a long time. I told him that I'm excited to see what he comes up with and that I'm looking forward to saying yes\n\nMy reasons for not wanting an engagement ring are 1. I don't like the sexist nature of the tradition that the woman wears an engagement ring, but not the man and 2. I would feel really nervous wearing something that expensive on my hand all the time. I would much rather have a simple symbol of our bond that we both share equally and put on together at our wedding.\n\nFast forward to the end of January. Fiance and I both take some time off work for a nice vacation in the mountains. On a hike he gets down on one knee and proposes. It was really magical and he did a great job. The only problem is the proposal also included a really nice looking ring. Of course I put it on in the moment and said I love it but I was really miffed my fiance didn't respect my request.\n\nWe talked about it later and I found out that he spent over 1000 dollars on it. I feel terrible that he dropped so much money on this and I'm constantly worried about losing it. I have not been wearing it and kept it in a box in the drawer so that it doesn't get lost and he seemed really hurt by this. I told him that I never even wanted a ring in the first place and he thought I was just saying that because I didn't want him to be out so much money. I also told him my reason about thinking the tradition is sexist and he said he wasn't trying to be sexist and thought it would be meaningful to me.\n\nI want to tell him to take it back but I don't want to hurt him even more.

It was half a page in normal size font that they increased to take up a whole page. They did not have a drivers license which is a requirement for the position and did not have any cover letter. \n\nResume 2 was 3 pages. They had one part time job, again not listing any acquired skills. They had their education as the last segment on their resume. They filled 2.5 pages with volunteer experience leaving off any dates or skills acquired though these experiences. Most volunteering was 2 hour projects. Their contact information was only located on the second page of their resume and they only had their name on the first page. Their font and size were not consistent across the document. Again, no cover letter. \n\nAnyway, Karen comes in while Iâ€™m lamenting on how bad these resumes are and how I dread weâ€™ll never find someone qualified enough to fill our basic entry level sales associate position. Karen has marital issues that the staff is well aware of because she literally never shuts up about them. I can tell you about her financial troubles, her kids, her husband and her *gag* sex life (which I NEVER asked about. Super funny though because she tells everyone about her husbands ED and how he canâ€™t hold a job because of it??). \n\nKaren starts tearing me a new one in that mom way for â€œharassing strong young men for their *likely* (obviously unknown because we canâ€™t ask) mental disabilityâ€?. I interviewed both of these candidates anyway because were so desperate for a hire. I understand not all mental deficits present but they both seemed normal, just lazy. I explained to Karen that it takes nothing for someone to google â€œhow to write a resumeâ€? and even just follow the first google example, but she still says I was being mean and abusing my power. \n\nCome to find out she has been telling the other locations she works at how Iâ€™m a horrible manager and no wonder no one will work for me. She has taken each of my employees to the side and asked them how they feel about me. They told me that Karen made them feel very uncomfortable by doing this and that they have no issues with me. \n\nTLDR: older female coworker says Iâ€™m being unfair by criticizing resumes. I interviewed the candidates and they were not a good fit as their resume suggested. ",

I typically am the one to stock the stoves at bedtime, me and the wife head to bed at the same time, on this particular night it was very cold and windy, this caused both stoves to use up their wood somewhat early so a new fire had to be lit in each stove, after I could verify that both fires had started successfully I headed off to bed. When I got to bed my wife had already been there for 25 minutes and she was nice and warm, I tried to slide up next to her to warm myself back up after hanging around the cold stoves to ensure they lit. She did not like this, started complaining that I was to cold and shoving blankets in between us. I was offended, said \"oh, i see how it is\" and rolled back over to my side of the bed. and fell asleep warming myself up. In the morning she's all bent and obviously upset and she says its because \"you rolled over to your side of the bed angry last night\". so my question is, AITA for expecting my wife to warm me up after coming to bed cold because I stayed up a little later to make sure our wood stoves were burning?

Episode due to mental health, took 5000e in payday loans from different companies, and spent around half on games, jewerly, god damn microtransactions on a Phone game, etc.\n\nNow, to Her Credit, she Came clean about it pretty quickly, and admitted she needed help. We Immidiately used the rest of the money to pay Off few of them (they had a first time customer offer, no interest if paid back inside a month of taking the loan, thankfully), leaving about 2300e left to pay from Her own income, which, due to the Fact that we don't have money, Will start to grow interest soon. Nothing we can do to stop that now. Anyway, onto the AITA part.\n\nShe has a large sum of money (2000e give or take 300e) coming as backpay for Her disability, and she has expressed hesitance at paying the loans back with it. As in, she keeps asking why she can't just pay the Monthly payments, over and over, and me explaning how 260% yearly interest rates are insane, over and over. Ofcourse, rent and bills need to be paid first, but after that, I told Her, the rest should go towards paying  the debt, due to the huge interest rates payday loans have. It won't be enough for all of it, but still a significant step towards getting the Hell out of This hole she dug.\n\nI also told Her that she doesn't need to worry about anything Else, moneywise. I'll feed and clothe Her, get food for Her cats, buy gas for Her car, take care of everything Else Until the debt is paid, as long as she devotes all Her money to it apart from rent and bills. Even thou I don't have any more money than she has, I can improvise the rest we need. Surviving with basically no money isn't exactly new to me... \n\nTo give some more insight into This:\n\nwe both are on the same kind of disability, usually get the same amount of money per month, around 900e. \n\nWe live separately, have separate money, everything. She doesn't live at my place technically, but she does spend most of Her time with me, and stays at my place almost every free night we have. \n\nWe are both students (the disability we get paid is tied to our studies, so if we don't get courses done, we don't get money. It is thing Where I live). \n\nwhile we have separate finances, we do live a quite symbiotic life what Comes to spending money on food and such, so while Her debt isn't my debt, it does affect me, and how much money I have to spend on other things. \n\nSo, AITA for expecting Her to use the money she is getting to pay most of the debt Immidiately, instead of the Monthly payments?\n\nPs. Before I start getting monetary advice, thank you, but no need. We have contacted multiple organizations that provide free professional consultation for situations just like This one. I'm sure that if there is a better way to do This than what I Came up, they'll tell me about it. ",

I'm currently in year 9. Be warned, it's a long post. So, I've recently cut ties with OF because I'm so sick of his bullshit. It started in year 7 with little things. OF would constantly take up the majority of the table in class, leaving me with about 2 A4 sheets of room, barely enough to work. When I would complain to him about this he would get really childish and say things like \"Is this better?\" while proceeding to take up more space. This got too much for me, as I'm very dedicated with my work, so I moved. Problem solved? NO. He'd move next to me and do the same thing. That was just the start of it. OF would constantly seem to be seeking attention, as much as I hate that term. He would do all he can to be the center of everything. It started with little digs at us, using words like fagget loosely without knowing the meaning or history of the words. He would then get to headlocking us and trying to yank our hair out because it was 'fun'. It got to the point where he would steal our phones and run around the school so that we could chase him. This annoyed me and Callum a lot, and in OF's defense we could have kept our cool a bit more than we did. Either way, we got to the end of the year, things died down, and we went into year 8. This was when things got worse. OF had gotten over the desk control, but had somehow gotten worse. He started insulting us and making fun of us for things like our body shape, really petty and immature things. Then when we would have a go at him back(again, should've kept our cool), he would resort to violence again. This went on and on. He could insult us but we couldn't even joke about him. He would also get very angry if he lost in games of downfall, and sometimes again, resort to violence. Things went on until 4th term. The boys invited me to be their goalkeeper for a futsal team. This worried me, and I'd be here forever if I explained it all. Basically I have on and off mental health issues and possibly social anxiety, not sure though. It sounds stupid, but the position of goalkeeper is a lot of pressure on me. I told OF all this and more, and explained that I didn't think it would be good for my mental health (I was right). Not to my surprise, OF wasn't sympathetic in the slightest, despite 'weawwy tweasuwing my fwendship'. He went on for weeks saying shit like 'OoOoHhH nOoO I can't be goalie cus I have depression! Get over it fagget.'. This really got me down, and I still don't understand why he said that. The same kind of thing happened this year. I felt quite down during a futsal match and he picked up on it. Same kind of thing 'if you feel like shit then don't come. You played like shit.\" This was the turning point for me, as I beat myself up about it anyway. I was sick of it. Am I the asshole for cutting ties with OF?",

I found a local girl (late 20's early 30's) who posted a pet sitter ad on a community website. We met, I checked references, agreed on a price, and everything seemed fine. I left payment on my counter before I left with detailed instructions. One thing I stressed was not to have anyone else in the house. I have rescue cats who don't like strangers, especially males, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. The day before I was to return home she sent me a message asking where the broom and mop was because \"I want you to return home to a clean house\". I told her not to worry about the floors because I do them a certain way and we left it at that. She was set to leave at 7:30 that morning for work and I got home around 9am.\n\nWell, when I got in the house reeked of feces. She left a big #2 in the main bathroom, the cats had peed multiple times in both the showers, there were food scraps in the bathroom garbage, and she didn't even bother to make the bed. She left wet towels in the dryer, and the kitchen was a disaster. It looked like she cooked a Thanksgiving feast. Food remnants in the sink, on the counters, drips down to the floors. My big crock pot and rice maker were left out and the dishwasher was full including casserole dishes, mixing bowls, measuring cups, herb scissors, turkey baster, etc. I could tell my dining room table was used because every chair was put back askew and the drop leaf was used. She used all my flour, left grease in multiple baking pans, left her own food/leftovers in the fridge, and multiple Tupperware containers were missing. This to me seemed like she had a dinner party when I specifically instructed her not to have people over. I was pissed, so I never contacted her again.\n\nShe messaged me yesterday asking if I would be needing someone to watch the cats in the next few months because she is trying to fill her calendar with house, pet, and baby sitting jobs. She posts in a local Facebook group so I know she is looking for work outside of her school district job. I wouldn't have brought any of these issues up with her, but since she messaged me again i'm debating telling her why I wouldn't use her services again detailing what I already outlined. Would I be the asshole to call her out after almost 6 months of silence?",

Chegg Study is useful for accessing textbook solutions, posting problems to be answered by \"experts\", and searching solutions previously worked by \"experts.\" For college students, it costs $15.00/month. Split among three people, that is $5.00 each per month. We will call my roommates Sally and Betsy.\n\nBetsy is the one who suggested we share a Chegg account. We were all studying one night, and Betsy had a chemistry test the next day. She kept saying how useful Chegg would be for chemistry. I thought it could be useful to me also, since I'm a science student. Betsy suggested the three of us share a Chegg account and pay $5.00 each per month. I knew that by owning the account, I was accepting the risk that my roommates might not hold up their agreement. Nevertheless, I created the account, shared the login information with Betsy and Sally, paid the $15.00 for that month, and sent Venmo requests to Betsy and Sally for $5.00 each. They each paid and we continued to study happily.\n\nThe second month rolled around, and I billed them both for $5.00 after Chegg charged me the $15.00. Sally texted me saying she didn't find it useful but knew it would be useful to me and Betsy. This annoyed me, but I had seen it coming. I decided I would retain the service if Betsy still wanted to share. I didn't bother asking Sally for my $5.00 back because I suspected she would refuse to pay it and throw a fit. Betsy agreed that she and I would retain the Chegg service and pay $7.50 each.\n\nThis month, like every other, I billed Betsy for my $7.50 after Chegg charged my account. She didn't ever pay it. I texted her and asked about it today. She said she wouldn't be using it anymore. I said that was fine, but I still needed the $7.50 because I had already been charged for the month. She was flabbergasted that I had the nerve to ask for my $7.50 that she had effectively spent by not notifying me that she wished to cancel the service. She says she will not pay for something that she isn't using. I explained that this would be like me refusing to pay rent because I decided to move out without giving her notice to find someone else to take over the lease, although the money is not that much. She became irate and insisted repeatedly that she said she \"only needed it for chemistry\" and that she had told me \"MONTHS ago\" that she would not need it after that. In my memory, this is false; she said she would use it for chemistry, not that she wanted to cancel it after the semester ended. And even if she did say that, I think she should have had the courtesy to remind me that she would no longer need the service. We both agreed that we should have had a conversation about whether we intended to continue using it after the semester ended. I told her I wasn't going to fight her over $7.50, but I was frustrated that she had asked me to create the account, then not held up her agreement. She raised the point that I didn't charge Sally for $5.00 when she decided to no longer pay, and I said that it was beside the point because she owed me $7.50 regardless of the $5.00 Sally owes me. I said that at some point, it's my money they're spending by refusing to pay. I feel that if the roles were flipped, she would demand I pay her $7.50.\n\nAITA for asking her to pay me $7.50?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

On Wednesday I decided I wanted to start looking around for dresses I like, and I made an appointment at a wedding dress shop for the following day at 11am.\n     Now, the reason I wanted to go do this initially without a large family presence is because I have a somewhat difficult relationship with my family. My mom and gma specifically can be extremely opinionated, to the point where I feel like all they do is criticize me or talk about me behind my back. They have the attitude that you should always agree with their opinion, and dont really accept your opinion. My Fiance is often frustrated with them because he feels they are \"narcissitic\" and they cause me to feel very sad or negative about things that should be exciting. Because of this growing up, I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety. I felt that if I went with them and found a dress, they wouldn't like it or they would be very negative about it. This is what led to me wanting to try on different styles of dresses without them. I wanted to figure out what I like, not what THEY like. \n     I did ask my sister (my maid of honor) to come with me to the dress appointment, and I also let my mom know I was going. My sister said she wanted to go, but she had to work. However, she did not feel like going to work, so she asked me to type a message to her boss to get her out of work, which I refused to do. Since no one else was available, I just asked one of my future sisters-in-law to go because I knew she would be supportive. \n     I tried on 6 dresses of all different styles at this fitting, but I just fell in love with the second dress. I was not expecting to actually find \"the\" dress at this appointment, but it just kind of happened. My gma had previously offered to pay for my dress, so I called her to the store to see it. I also called my sister, who was supposed to be at work. Turns out she only went to work for 2 hours, and got home around the time my appointment started. It was minutes from our house, she knew I was there and had the option to come. I told her I found something and wanted her to look. She was visibly annoyed, but she came.  I tried on 2 more dresses with my gma and sister there that I let them pick out. After those, they did say they liked the dress I found, and my mother, whom I facetimed, said she loved the dress and thought I should get it.\n     My gma got the dress for me. She seemed a little sad, but was happy I was happy. My sister mentioned that she was kind of hurt that I chose to go with my fiance's sister instead of her because she would have liked to see me try on dresses. I feel like she had the choice to be there, but decided not to come. \n     Now I am feeling incredibly guilty and selfish for how everything played out. My fiance believes that I gave the opportunity to come and look at other dresses and its their own actions that made it so they were not there. So, Reddit, AITA?",

We drove to the restaurant, got our table and ordered drinks. Then the disaster happened: Our table was kind of small, and we are a large family (all of my uncles, aunts and so on were invited too) so we had to sit a bit wider to fit everyone of us to the table (note, the restaurant is a bit small too). Then some entitled bitch, lets call her Karen, came in with her younger sugarboy and her goddamn noisy rathound( or chihuaha or how you call them) to sit on the other table, back to back with me. (Note, she was fat, not chubby but fat) She sat down on the seat back to me, and needed more space to sit there, but she didn't ask me to make room for her, she just shoved the seat against my back till i made room myself (which i thought was rude) but i didn't react to that yet. When she finally got to sit in her seat, she shoved her seat against mine again, even though i had no place to make room anymore, but i even endured that one. But when she shived her arms violently against mine on MY! Armrest so she could reach her ratdog in her bag, i flipped.\n\nI stood up and asked her what the fuck she thinks she is doing, pushing me away without asking first and then just pushing back more for no reason whatsoever. Entitled Karen looked at me like:\" why is someone like you even talking to me\" which made me even angrier so i told her to back the hell away or something happens. With a big grunt of hers she moved her seat more to her table( she had more than enough room for her, even after that move) so i could sit comfortably again.\n\nMy parents looked at me like I just did the unthinkable.

At the same time we planned for my parents to come for one of the weeks and are visiting from my home country. We planned to stay together and do activities in that time. My Mom generously said my Dad and her would cover things while we were together. Awesome. I'm super thankful for them doing this. So one of the days we finish a small fishing trip and some wine tasting and my partner and I had discussed maybe doing dinner just the two of us. I ask/let my Mom know that we wanted to have a dinner out, just the two of us and they are all sweet with it and say they're planning on eating in. Side note, my Dad still cooks like 6 people still live in a house so already on our holiday we have too much food. So we eventually find a place, order, eat and have some leftovers of a half n' half pizza. We end up going back to the AirBnb and I go to chill in the our room. My Mom comes in chewing on a piece of my partner's pizza and sits down on the bed staring at me. I kinda gave her this look to which she says something along the lines of \"What..why are you looking at me like that/what's the matter??\" I think I said something like \"Well, that's Dan's pizza... you should have asked.\" Immediately she gets angry/hurt/defensive, says something (can't remember), I respond then she leaves. Suddenly outside the room on the balcony I hear her talking quite upset to my partner about what I said.   \n\n\nDan didn't know at all what was going on. He had come out of the toilet and was having a smoke when she came up. (D for Dan, M for Mom)\n\nM: \"Sorry Dan I ate a piece of pizza, I hope thats fine\"\n\nD: \"Absolutely, not a problem, but I would liked to be asked in the future.\"\n\nM: \"Why?\"\n\nD: \"Its just common courtesy.\"\n\nM: \"But we've paid for everything. We've paid for the trip, accomodation, activities. I don't have to ask for a bit of pizza.\"\n\nD: \"Its still common courtesy to ask regardless of what has been done.\"\n\nM: \"Well I've given you all this and I expect the same in return.\"\n\nAt this point we were just trying to get across that common courtesy should be used no matter the case. We paid for the pizza and still may have wanted it, but were happy to share. We tried giving other examples but it boiled down to her believing/expectation that if she gives then she expects to receive no questions in return. We tried to explain that she made it seem like listing what they've paid for was more a gift with strings attached rather than an unconditional gift. We also said that while those might be her expectations, other people (like us) don't necessarily expect the same of others.\n\nIt ended with silence, in the morning it was the same and is still technically unresolved but I was left feeling like I wasn't wrong but guilty because she/my Dad had paid for everything. Reddit, am AITA somewhere in this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Mom and Dad paid for part of a two week trip we (including my partner) spent together. Mom got upset when I said she should have asked before taking a slice of pizza from our dinner out. My partner and I were just bringing up common courtesy while she felt that paying for accommodation, activities and groceries entitled her to a simple slice of pizza/not needing to ask. AITA for saying she should have just asked first.",

A lot. A few years ago when we used our PS3 a lot, he broke about 4 controllers in separate fits of rage, and during his fortnite addiction, I heard some loud banging from across the hallway. The next day, he started asking for my controller.\n\nThis controller is simply a wired Xbox controller made for people who want to play PC games using a controller but don't want to spend the 60 bucks on a wireless controller that I got for my birthday. I use this controller a lot for the sort of couch co-op or games that have very simple controls (Think GBA emulation, The Binding of Isaac, Super Treasure Arena, etc.).\n\nSo I say okay at first, but tell Zam he needs to save money up for a controller of his own. He says he will, and I'm alright with this deal.\n\nThat was three months ago, and he has yet to get a new controller, and I've heard him abuse mine more than once.\n\nEventually, I wanted to play some Isaac with my computer connected to the TV so I could sit on my bed while playing, and asked if I could use the controller once he was done with his round of fortnite. He muttered sure and continued playing. The round ends, and he doesn't give it back. Instead, he just queues up again. I tell him to give it back, and he says \"I just started this round, let me finish R\\*tard\". I'm livid at this point, so I unplug the controller, turn off the xbox, take the controller, and walk out of the room. (This was probably an overreaction, but he used R\\*tard specifically against me because I have Asperger's Syndrome). He calls me an asshole for doing that and he attempts to grab me and shove me against a wall. I shove him away, he stumbles, then he runs down to mom, crying, and tells her that I beat him up (He's 12, and he wasn't crying when he got stabbed by a fucking fish hook from his own stupidity). I got grounded for a week on account of \"Treating my brother like crap\", and he taunted me by using my controller the entire time I was grounded.\n\nI had enough, and I've taken it; every time he asks for it I say no.\n\nHe still insists I'm an ass for doing so, and that's the question: Am I The Asshole?

We become amazing friends and spend so much time together and literally can find any way to have a good time.\n\nBut then there is their best friend, (they have the same best friend) Adam. Adam is 24.\n\nAt first Adam came across as friendly and interested in getting to know me. But then one day when I'm in the car with Adam and Levi, I start going through what I like to refer as a \"lull\" where I don't initiate any conversation and just become quiet but it's kinda like I'm socially spent and I just feel \"low\" and at the time I assumed I was depressed but never went to get it checked out.\n\nWell ever since that time Adam started treating me different. If we were all in a car he would talk and interact with every single person except me, even if I said some kind of comment directed at him. The only time he would seldom \"talk\" to me was indirectly when someone brought up something about me that i did that was funny or silly in a joking way and he would take it more serious and thrown in a passige aggressive remark. \n\nIt was like Levi and Ian didn't see it. And at first I thought I was going crazy and just paranoid and I remember literally telling Ian \"I don't think Adam likes me\" and his response was \"I think he just doesn't know you\". \n\nI never experienced this with Levi and Ian. It was like day and night. It was so fun to be around them that I put up with Adam's behavior, even when it meant he would \"control\" the group and be the person deciding what we would do. \n\nLevi and Ian eventually notice my \"lulls\". It was first brought up with Levi asking me what I wanted the most in the world and I said to be on vacation for a weekend. I hadn't gone on vacation in two years due to financial circumstances with my family, my dad having lost his job of 20 years a couple years back.\n\nThen Levi mentions that his family (middle class like mine but on leaning toward upper middle class) had a cabin in the state just north of hours and says would I be down for going on a vacation and I said yeah that was so nice of him. He says we can plan for the end of the summer (it was late June at this point)\n\nIf becomes evident Adam is going on this trip as Levi sends me details of dates and what to bring. I wondered if this was something I really wanted to do as it's been like going to the dentists office Everytime I'm around Adam no matter how hard I try to be his friend, and I want to be his friend.\n\nSo the day comes and it's like I should have turned back and ran but I didn't the moment I found out we were traveling all in Adam's car and suddenly 20 minutes in the driving of a 4 hour drive I'm regretting coming. It's like they don't see that I'm being excluded from the conversation or that anytime i mention something Adam brings up something that he, Levi and Ian exclusively do (they always hang out together and Adam keeps mentioning how next Saturday they should do this or that and Levi tries to act dumb and says \"Saturday\"? And Adam says we always hang out on Saturday. (Adam is making it obvious he wants me to know that they hang out every Saturday without me and it bothers me not that they do but that he's trying to antagonize me with it) \n\nAnd then we get to the trip. It's hell. \nThree days of doing things I've never done before but Adam wants to do and it's like Ian and Levi don't see it and remain who they are usually but at the same different people in terms of acting oblivious to Adam's behavior and to me it's like I'm the only one who sees a fire but everyone around me doesn't even smell the smoke.\n\nI try to hide my \"lulls\" because I know it will upset Adam. I get quiet and try to collect myself during this hellish time and try to be positive but it's too much. A couple times I put on my sunglasses and wipe tears as I pretend to be readjusting them.\n\nThen the day before the last day of the trip I'm in the room I sleep in in the cabin and Adam comes down stairs and says \"whats wrong /jillerski?\" And I say \"what do you mean?\" And he sits down and motions me to sit down (on the bed in front of him because there are two beds in the room) \n\nHis exact words \"you're like a roller, coaster. You're fun to be around and then ten minutes later you're bringing everyone down.\" And I'm like \"....I'm sorry.\" I feel bad because in general I hate bothering people. He says \"this trip wasn't cheap, and you won't be invited again unless you start getting your act together.\" And I tell him I'm sorry that I've been feeling down because of my family's economic problems and that sometimes I don't feel good and he said \"well just pretend to be happy.\" \"You're starting to bring everyone down and it's ruining the trip for Levi and Ian.\" And I said ok and I smiled and went outside and saw Levi and Ian sitting in the boat (we were gonna go out for the day) and they are acting like two people who are trying too hard to not act like they knew what went down. And we go out and I pretend to be happy the whole trip and smiles smiles smiles. \n\nWhen I get home eventually and I get signal back in my phone (couldn't talk to anyone outside of the 4 of us because I had no signal) I get a text from Ian saying \"I hope Adam didn't say anything that bothered you\" and I just stopped hanging out with them and maybe I am the asshole for ruining the trip they generously provided. And maybe I'm even a bigger asshole for not hanging out with them ever again.",

Anyways I was dating my last girlfriend for around a month before she broke up with me. We had been flirting and texting with a some real dates, but since her parents were strict and I'm reserved we never really hung out for too long. This is all going great the usual I love yous, then we were hanging out with her friends she had to leave to go home. She texted me after she left, but I didnt even realise she had gone. So while talking to her friends I jokingly sent \"lol are you too embarrassed of me?\" Long story short she dumped me right after that. AITA here?",

My brother's team starts to behind in goals, and the opponents and their coach seem to think this is a great opportunity to be crazily disrespectful, making dirty fouls, clapping loudly whenever our team misses a pass, insulting the crowd and making fun of my little brother's team (\"hey let's try and get that 10 goal lead\"). Things are clearly heating up, and I'm slowly getting mad and excited, even though I still remain quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game ends, my mom and I are heading out, while my father waits inside gymnasium for my brother. The enemy team's players come out: they're loud, obnoxious, and complaining about a lack of fair-play from our team. I'm out of the car, while my mom's sitting in it. I overhear them trashtalk my club one too many times, and it makes my blood boil. I open the car's door and tell my mom I'm going to see them. I call the other team's coach, and tell him that I reckon he's being pretty arrogant for a coach that didn't see his team win a single game the year prior, and lose every week-end by 40 to 10. By the time I end my sentence, my mom has jumped out of the car, stepped in and is insulting the coach. I know she's short-tempered and really hot-headed, so I'm considering holding her back ; but the coach is already getting inside his car. I turn around and start walking towards our car, certain my mom is right behind me, but after a few steps I hear them both still arguing. When I look back, my mom has opened the coach's car, and she's almost stepped in yelling at his face. I'm pretty paralysed at this point, still very stirred up. I don't move until a few seconds later, when my mom finally comes back to the car, sits in and lets out a sigh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know what I did probably wasn't the right nor best thing to do, but I just felt like this time I wouldn't let it go ; but I also realise that was she did was very wrong, and that the guy could've hit her. She then asks me that I don't tell my father, as he'd be really angry at her for what she did, because it could've turned out real bad for her. But I also don't want her to do that again, when noone else will be by her side to help her if it turns bitter.

She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?",

I also just remembered this sub while being confused andhope this is the right place. I donâ€™t really am a frequent reddit user and made a new account just for this. So I donâ€™t really know how all of this works but here I go.\n\nSo I am currently having quite a hard time with one group of friends from high school. Itâ€™s been around half a year now where from my perspective they started becoming more and more distant. Or rather me and my best friend at that time. The last time we did anything together was a week before Christmas and since then it especially went down the drain.\nI should probably add that both of us are kinda broken on the mental side which lead to us not really being able to react properly at that time making us grow apart quite a bit.\nIt ended with me becoming distant or excluded from the rest of this group of friends. They ignored me, wouldnâ€™t talk to me and did stuff without me. \n\nThen in the beginning of this year my mind cleared up a bit. But they kept ignoring me. One day then I was told I was too negative und that that only dragged them down so they started to avoid me. And I can at that point only agree that I was still pretty negative and all.\nBut them ignoring me didnâ€™t really make that better at all und made me grow more annoyed and confused which in tirn would make us grow even further apart.\n\nSo I decided to offer a full turn. I wouldnâ€™t be negative and just stop doing so and they in turn wouldnâ€™t ignore me. And then we did that.\nOr so I thought. I took extra notice on my behavior and all and didnâ€™t really do anything they complained about (yes Iâ€™m certain about that. I even kept track and wrote that down for a bit).\nBut even though they agreed they didnâ€™t do anything of the agreement. They stayed distant and kept treating me like air.\n\nAnd now a few days ago after I tried to initiate talking and all, which failedin both ways. When I talked about stuff I was interested in and that happened to me or just asked general questions I was really just talking to a wall. Now I tried going with something they ((ex)best friend) was interested in.\n\nAgain I need to say how I made these friends rather recently when one of them transferred to my school 1.5 years ago. And they also were the first proper friends (or so I would say) in highschool (we are close to finishing but my mind stopped me from being able to properly interact with others before them).\nAnd through my (ex)best friend. I opened up quite a bit and was able to start doing things I always wanted to do (join a theatre group, considering going to a dance school) but also stuff irrelevant to them (eg. school chorus).\n\nGoing back to the other thing I tried. After I tried talking about that topic and before that aswell in a way I now realize. \nThey accused me of copying them and that being the only reason I do those things (subjective interpretation of what they said). They also wrote that they would still be avoiding me because I would be so negative and annoyed which I have to admit, I started tobe again after they did nothing of their part while I kept pretending that it didnâ€™t bother me to not be negative.\n\nSo AITA for reacting negatively and annoyed (I would be ... I donâ€™t really know ... unfriendly I guess) after they ignored me for so long me being sad about it, reconciling afterwards but them not doing what they said they would. \nAnd especially now after they simply told me that they will avoid me even more after I didnâ€™t just remain cold after all of that and also accusing me of just copying them and being to only reason I do the things I like.\n\nAm I in the wrong for reacting negative to this.\n\nI donâ€™t remember what I am supposed to write at the end and I just hope I didnâ€™t come to the wrong place cause I donâ€™t know if this is appropriate for this sub nor if it violates the rules but I really donâ€™t know.\n\nI also apologize for the outdrawn sentences I know they are/were annoying if you read this far.

I just felt like this was something no one talked about, so I'm attempting to now. I've only recently actively looked into this sub, but I've fleetingly seen posts for quite some time now that have really grabbed my attention. People seem to write in often where the scenario they depict is almost too outrageous and ridiculous to believe, or they seem very obvious that OP would is NTA. It really looks like people take the catharsis to a little too close heart, and forgot that honesty and transparency is needed in order for any of the resolution to be genuine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only outlook I have in these evident posts being genuine is kind of a cynical one. It's sad to say, but I think it's really possible there are plenty of people who really don't know or know how to expect someone close to them to be a decent human being with fairness and compassion. They often land themselves with people who aren't worth a damn because they don't know they deserve better or the right to fight for improving their quality of life with family if they've truly been wronging you. I really hope that's not the case, but, either way, it boils down to the conditioned inability to stomp out the bullshit, or you being the one creating it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't doubt that many of you have candidly presented yourselves as unbiased as you could, but, what's funny is that no one has pointed out how absolutely absurd it is to expect someone to \"depict both sides of the story\", like the sub states. You will always be speaking for the other person. No matter how bipartisan you are about the ordeal, phrasing is everything, and anyone can tell a story differently without changing the events to make themselves the victor and the other the villain. These nameless people the OP has conflict would almost always have a better chance at gaining favor or defending themselves if they were able phrase things the way they wanted to, or at all for that matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the other extreme, there's nothing stopping anyone from making up a dishonest, slanderous story to reap the affirmation they might desperately desire to quell their unchanging, narrowed outlook on any given situation. I don't blame them to be honest, because it seems like something we all do to some extent. Reddit, and social media in general is a great place to escape to and experience a rare and odd form of gratification, especially in the way you present yourself to other people. You get to control how much or how little you want someone to know, and since verification of these types of \"text only\" stories doesn't really exist, there's nothing stopping you from completely inflating your ego and confirming how \"right\" you are, even at the expense of the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is in no way a novel concept, but I feel I really need to say that some things are better left unsaid if they can't be told sincerely. If you need some kind of break from reality or can't face the decisions you make, that is entirely your choice and freedom to do so. I just don't think it serves any kind of long-term benefit to pose as these relatively innocent, guiltless people if that's not how you exist in the real world.",

My sister and I were cut off from competing through our own region because our original partners told us we couldnâ€™t work with them the day the project was due (so we couldnâ€™t have time to even put something together). So we joined forces with these other two girls we met through this competition who live in a different region to compete through their region.

From the ages of 14-18ish my life was chaotic because of situations I put myself in. I was constantly gossiping about people, spreading other peopleâ€™s secrets, getting way too drunk, victimizing myself when things would go wrong, talking about vulgar things a work to get attention (like going into extreme detail about my sex life to coworkers I barely spoke to), etc. \n\nWhen I was 18 and had dropped out of college after graduating 2nd in my class in high school, I realized I didnâ€™t like the person I was becoming and was embarrassed by my actions. So from there it took a lot of mindfulness and practice to be a better person, and although I still sometimes catch myself starting to do my past behaviors, I do genuinely feel like Iâ€™m a good person that makes a positive impact on other peopleâ€™s lives. \n\nNow to the current situation:\n\nI have a best friend, D, who Iâ€™ve been close with since middle school.  She loves having big groups of friends rather than close, individual friends so she always wants me to hang out with her friends.  The problem is, most of her friends act the way I did when I was 18. It was so so hard for me to break those habits so I donâ€™t want those behaviors around me. \n\nFor example, Dâ€™s other best friend, H, is constantly flirting with married coworkers and slept with her exâ€™s brother to make him jealous.  I donâ€™t want to be around H because it frustrates me to hear these stories and I donâ€™t want that kind of toxic energy around me anymore. I figured since I havenâ€™t known her very long (only a few months) it wouldnâ€™t be very damaging to stop the friendship.   D told me I was being very judgmental about situations that donâ€™t affect me at all and can just be funny stories to hear about. \n\nAnother example is with Dâ€™s friend A. Long story short, A had a one night stand with a guy, the guy didnâ€™t want a relationship, so sheâ€™s been harassing him for the past YEAR, lied about aborting his kid (she was never pregnant), stalks his current girlfriend, creates fake profiles and phone numbers to contact him since he blocks her every time, etc. When he rejects her, she cuts her arm and sends him pictures. I donâ€™t want all that in my life. D says I shouldnâ€™t take it too seriously since A isnâ€™t hurting me directly. \n\nSo, AITA for judging these people and not wanting to be friends with them?\n\nTl;dr My best friend has very chaotic (imo) people in her life that I donâ€™t want in mine.

I decided to swallow my pride and apologize to her. I thought I did so in a very carefully constructed way, telling I should not have done the things I did and that I was sorry. She did not respond. It might have been her way of handling the argument we had. Cooling down before sending a message, so that it would not be written out of anger. I decided to text my mom asking if I had done anything wrong.\n\nAs time went by, I was getting more annoyed, since I was the one reaching out and swallowing my pride. I did not want to show any of this anger to my sister though, since we have always been very close and me hurting her might sent her back into mental instability. I ended up venting a lot of my anger towards my mother and saying that I want my sister to apologize to me. She managed to calm me down and I went to sleep. \n\nThis morning, I saw that my sister had sent some messages and I was secretly hoping they were apologies. However, These messages were just to show her side of the story and telling me she does not want to include our mother in our arguments. Then there were some casual messages afterwards to try and end this entire situation. This almost broke my patience, since I felt the only reason I included our mother was to protect her from myself. Additionally, she still ignored the apology message I had sent the night before. I sent one message saying that I did not like it that she ignored my apology, because I had to use a lot of self-control to type it. I think it might have been her way of putting this entire situation behind her and moving on. I feel that I need her to at least say that she appreciates that I apologized.\n\nNow I feel like I might sent some hurtful messages if I contact her again, since my patience is almost spent, but I still want the opinion of others. She was right that I should have not included our mother, but the situation gnawed at me and I had to get a second opinion. \n\nSo now I would like to ask you guys: Am I the asshole by saying I want her to acknowledge my apology?",

Eventually we did decide to start dating and see where it would go. It was a strain on both of us as we had difficulty communicating and finding time with each other. We broke up for about 2 months. \n\nDuring that break she was on tinder and starting sleeping with a guy. Things happen, she was single and I completely understand. We ended up starting to be friendly again and fell right back into dating. She had only been seeing this guy for a couple of weeks and only knew him from Tinder. \n\nAfter we got back together I noticed that she kept chatting with him. What really got to me was on New Years Eve he texted her  and she was chatting with him briefly. I had a very frank discussion with her that it seemed strange to me and it felt like she wasn't cheating but basically keeping him in reserve if it didn't work out between us. She said she would stop talking to him. After that, we still both had our traveling jobs and would only see each other monthly and really didn't learn anything from the previous times so eventually we wound up breaking up again. It's been about 6 months and we're doing our best to renew our friendship as much as possible but she admitted he was the first person she slept with after we broke up. \n\nIn our time, I was never insecure about being on the road, I feel very secure we wouldn't cheat on each other but that was the one thing I was insecure about and it ended up manifesting itself to be true. She says it's not wrong, which is true, but I still feel disrespected. \n\nThoughts? ",

One player in the group who has been a friend for years (henceforth referred to as R) constantly interrupts the game by talking loudly, arguing with my rules, and generally trying to get everything to go his way. Others in the group have complained about his disruptions as well, and I have had many conversations with him on how to improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to the current story. The session was already going awry because the group kept splitting off and fighting amongst themselves. I honestly don't care what their characters do, but I do care when the players yell and fight as it causes a disruptive environment. So R had been goofing off with another player, Z, all night. They sat in the corner and talked and didn't pay attention which slowed play down for others since I had to keep repeating myself for them. Z has really never been a problem so I simply told her to quiet down and she apologized (even though the behavior continued). R, however, refused to acknowledge what he was doing was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end of the night, I was fed up. About 10 minuted before the session was due to end, I tossed a marker onto the table which R then picked up and hurled at my face (probably trying to be funny). I was pissed. So I waited until it was his turn in combat again and told him to either pick up the marker or have disadvantage on the rest of his rolls (roll twice and take the lowest). He refused and another friend picked up the marker to avoid confrontation. So I then told R to either apologize for his behavior or have the same punishment. He refused and said he would continue playing without listening. I skipped his turn and continued playing with the others. He proceeded to quit the game and then sulk around for the last ten minutes (because his car was trapped between others and he couldn't storm out like he wanted to).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was ready to go to bed after dropping off another friend, but I instead came home to 15 messages from R. He began by pouring out his heart about how much he was looking forward to the evening and I ruined it, and how he spent his own money to pay for snacks (we paid to feed him dinner), and generally being manipulative. He called me an ass/asshole exactly 7 times. He complained that I singled him out instead of dealing even punishments. I was reading these messages and crying (I cry when I get frustrated) so my mom snatched the phone from my hand and read the messages. He is no longer allowed at our house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I will eventually forgive him, but I was tired for taking to high road for once. So was he right?

I stopped texting them, didn't ask them to do anything, etc. Just to see if anything happened. And nothing did. No one tried getting in touch.

I am 6ft5 and get a little bit anxious when I feel like I'm in a confined space, not panic attack bad but I find it difficult to relax and my stomach goes a bit mad. My stop is the first stop so the bus is empty, and most of the seats are difficult to fit my legs behind. As a result I have a really uncomfortable journey. That is unless I get one of the seats on the top deck of the bus at the front, where there is legroom a plenty. It's the only seat I can comfortably sit in. \n\nThe bus stop is pretty busy and most people want this seat, however the vast majority of people are significantly shorter than me, and I am always the tallest person there. So when the bus pulls up I will weave between people to get round them and get that seat. My reasoning is that they will suffer little to no discomfort from sitting in the seats with less legroom. To clarify this isn't a queue where you are rewarded for being early, it's a bit of a free for all and you're rewarded for guessing where the doors stop. The unwritten rule is that if you guess right you are rewarded by getting to go on the bus first, generally people don't push past each other once on the bus has stopped. I however flout this rule believing my need for the leg room seat to be greater. \n\nI mentioned this to a friend and she said 'ahh tall white male assumes he's entitled to the best seat on the bus, typical'. She was joking but it got me thinking, should I actually be doing this or am I being a selfish asshole. \n\nA few clarifications: \n\nI do not use my size to physically push past people, for a tall lad I'm quite nimble it's more of a weave. \n\nThe queue system is respected generally once the bus has stopped\n\nIf it was a traditional queuing system I would go early, let a bus go by and make sure I was first in line for the next bus. \n\n**TL;DR: Am I (a tall man) the asshole for weaving past people to get a better leg room seat?**",

After the month of drunk driving snaps is when I realized this could end poorly.\n\nThe incident. \n\nOn one of the weekends she wasnâ€™t scheduled to work, we went out for a late dinner with a mutual friend. She had been drinking all day and had 2 drinks at the restaurant when she became unresponsive and passed out in her seat in the restaurant around 9:30 or so. She had never passed out before. Blacked out-many times, but she didnâ€™t sound inebriated or display any sign of drunkenness whatsoever in any of those situations. We were both pretty fucking embarrassed and I was a smidge angry to have to drag a passed out women from restaurant. The mutual friend that I had dinner with also was aware of my fwbâ€™s drinking problems and that she was in a downward spiral. In jest, one of us had mentioned,\n\nâ€œWe should just drop her ass off in detox for alcohol poisoning so she can finally have her god damn wake up call. She wont remember the last 8 hours of today anyways. She will probably think a stranger dropped her off and would be none the wiser.â€? \n\nSo thats exactly what we did. I left and went home. She came to and sobered up there, and had no idea how she got there, or any recollections of the evening. I lied to her and said we got dinner and a few drinks, and then she ran off as she was prone to and we couldnâ€™t find her. A week later or so, she got her hospital bill which was a few grand she couldnâ€™t afford. I stopped seeing around this time, so Iâ€™m not sure if â€œshe had her wake up call or not.â€? \n\nTLDR: dropped an alcoholic off at detox to give them a wake up call when I could have easily just taken care of them at home myself.",

We currently have pre-season training going on and I see the kids a few times a week to run around the indoor track or do weightlifting. It's always run by the head coach and myself (assistant coach) but because I work closer to the school, sometimes I get to the school first and get practice underway until the head coach arrives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe athletes had practice on Valentine's Day, and I decided to change things up a bit. The head coach was still en route so I gathered the troops and talked to them about Galentine's Day while we waited. In my monologue, I suggested they recognize all the strong women that came before and use this day to turn to each other and make a commitment to celebrate and unite as strong, young leaders. I finished my statement by saying it's hard being a woman in today's culture and girls should stick together and work to raise each other. My speech lasted about 60 seconds, most of the kids seemed receptive, and afterwards practice went on as usual. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next afternoon I get an email from the school's athletic director with the head coach and some other big honchos cc'd in. He instructed me, in no gentle terms, that I was a coach and my interactions with the students should be strictly lacrosse related. The AD was not thrilled with the fact I was \"pushing an agenda\" without the head coach present and gave me a slap on the wrist for \"unprofessional behavior\", implying that I wouldn't get a third chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached out to the head coach immediately to ask what the fuck was going on. She told me although my intentions were good, apparently some athletes thought I was specifically targeting them in my speech for being mean to other girls on the team. One told her parent who went over the coaches' heads straight to the athletic director. Head coach acknowledged that I had the best of intentions, but it wasn't my place to say that to my athletes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am utterly flabbergasted. I thought telling high school girls \"women are great, be excellent to each other\" was simple and safe but apparently not. I thought I was doing something good but everyone around me seems to believe I stepped out of line. ",

It was gone by that night. \n\nI had received a different bottle of wine as a Christmas gift from my mom. I left it on the table for the next few days, intending to put it away, but it kept slipping my mind. It was one of those Game of Thrones bottles with a pretty cool label. Game of Thrones is a big deal in our house, and I had wanted to open it for the premiere. \n\nI came home from work Friday to find it opened and half drank. Pretty bummed, I wanted to know who did it so I could explain that it had been mine. When I found out, I texted him and just let him know what was up - that was mine and had been a gift. He immediately replied that it was the wine our other roommate had offered to him before it was offered to me. I explained that no, that bottle was gone. The one he was drinking tonight was mine. I got no reply. \n\nThe next day I was busy and really only saw him in passing. On Sunday afternoon when I saw him again, I asked if he'd be willing to replace the bottle or if I was just eating the loss. He got a little annoyed and said people drink his stuff all the time and he never asks for it to be replaced. Now, there is one person in this house who drinks other people's alcohol on a regular basis and it's not either one of us. And he knows that. I said I only cared because it was a Christmas gift that I had a plan for, then walked off to my room, deciding not to pursue it further at that point. I realized it was partially my fault for leaving it out. As I entered my room and pushed the door closed it shut rather forcefully. Totally unintentional, I swear. I wasn't really feeling more than disappointed and a little frustrated at this point, and I haven't intentionally slammed a door in anger since I was a kid. \n\nWe ran into each other a little bit later and he asked, \"You do understand it was a mistake, right?\" I said a bit tersely \"yeah, but you haven't even apologized for it.\" He started raising his voice at me at this point, and I definitely started to raise mine back in reflex. He was saying a lot about how it matters to him when people drink his beers but he never asks for it back or an apology. He kept saying it was a mistake, and I said I agreed that I shouldn't have left it out but once he realized it was mine instead of the other bottle that an apology would be warranted. That's when he screamed at me that he didn't make any mistake, but rather that I did. His reasoning was that I should have known that he would think it was the other bottle (the one opened, drank by all, and emptied 3 days prior) and open it and drink it, and my refusal to reconcile with my mistake was not his problem. \n\nIt was at this point that I got confused and dropped my raised tone. I said that made no sense. How could I have known that he would think that? He kept yelling, yelled that I was too emotional, then walked off. Now unfortunately he is also the landlord's son. He told me he wanted me out in 30 days. I thought it was just something said in anger and decided to let him cool off. I waited until I was about to go to bed that night and apologized for getting so heated and making him upset, because I was. I can be a little reactionary when I feel people getting upset with me and that's what happened here. My emotions were especially out of wack because I was/am stil dealing with being sexually assaulted on Christmas eve. Not an excuse for getting heated and I will own up to that, but it explains it a little. I never wanted a blow out fight over this, just a \"shit, sorry dude\" at minimum. Regardless, he told me my apology means jack shit to him, and that anybody willing to \"come at him\" in his own house like that would be willing to do it again. He said he lets us live here out of the kindness of his own heart and I abused that.\n\nHe served me with a notice on New Year's Eve in front of a roommate and a party guest. Now I'm being kicked out of my house over wanting an apology for a bottle of wine. Am I the asshole?",

We live in a HCOL area so this was a big deal for us, a very significant part of our lives. Prior to that we had each been saving and living in random shared accommodation for years, so a huge motivation for us to buy was to have our own space together.\n\nThe property we got is somewhere we hope to one day start a family and so it is more than we need for two people. We considered getting a lodger and one of my best friends (let's call them J) was looking for somewhere at the same time. Despite being wary of ruining an important friendship through the friction of living together, we decided it made sense. This was the first time in my life that I was in a position like this and for reasons I can't really explain it was and I guess still is important to me that I was giving a friend a  good deal. We settled on offering J the room for 600 instead of 900.\n\nWe lived together like this with no problems for a while and then for work reasons my partner moved overseas. This means that we will see each other approximately 4 times a year for the next 3 years. I continued to live in the property with J for the next few months with no issues.\n\nThe first time my partner got time off work to visit was over Christmas. A few weeks before this we asked J if we could have the place to ourselves for a couple of days while my partner was here. His response did not seem particularly enthusiastic, but nor did I notice any particular resentment about it. J said he would work something out, and if necessary stay with his girlfriend. We did not discuss specifics such as dates and I was quite content that there were no problems.\n\nFast forward to the week before my wife got home and she wanted to confirm that it was still ok for us to have the place to ourselves so she sent a message with the dates we thought would be most convenient for J given the plans we knew he had over Christmas. His reply was very snippy and said he had not realised this was still a thing and it was not ideal to be unable to come home but that he would stay with his gf. We thought this was really weird but as he was away at the time we didn't have a chance to speak in person we just said thanks and left it at that.\n\nOver the next week J was very off with me, refusing to engage in conversation (messages) with me etc. This was out of character and definitely a consequence of simmering resentment that my wife and I didn't understand. Finally, my wife arrives home and we don't have much on our minds except each other and we have an amazing day spending our first Christmas together (not actually Christmas, just another day we chose to call that) as a married couple in our home that we had bought together (bonus: it was one of the best days of my life). As agreed J stayed with his girlfriend and we are grateful for this, despite being wary about his message and feeling that hanging over us. \n\nThe next day he sends a very hostile message asking us to do him a favour and next time my wife was visiting not to ask him not to be in the house he rents from us. I reply asking if that was everything that was bothering him and he confirmed there was nothing else. We suggested that we talk about it when he was home.\n\nHe arrives home and stays in his room for a couple of days (unprecedented behaviour for him) until eventually I ask him if he wants to talk. Basically, he said his problem was that it was inconvenient to him that we would ask him to be out of the house and that he found it mind blowing that we would think it was an acceptable request. He had run it past other people and they unanimously agreed with him.\n\nIn reply we were pretty firm that we didn't think it was an unreasonable request and that he should have said if he was unhappy so we could work something out that didn't inconvenience him. He said it was the general fact he couldn't come home that was inconvenient rather than the specifics. I know it's not really relevant, but for context his long term girlfriend lives reasonably close by and it's not unusual for him to stay with her. Obviously we would not have asked him to sleep on the streets or get a hotel or something. The conversation ended with an agreement that it came down to a difference of opinion about whether the request was normal and acceptable.\n\nThat was a couple of days ago now, but I have since been feeling rather bitter about the whole situation. I feel like a close friend of both of us should understand our need for some time alone in the brief spells we get together. I also feel extremely resentful about his bitterness towards us, and the fact he was speaking to other people about how unreasonable we are, despite the fact we give him a significant discount on his rent for being our friend.\n\nI have tried to be as unbiased as possible writing this, I hope I have managed to present an accurate picture because I am looking for honest feedback about whether my feelings are justified and whether I should set them out plainly to J.",

This account is mainly for a game but I do sometimes branch off and can be considered a throwaway.\n\n\nContext: This happened in high school, I believe my second year with Friday's being a shorter day and during break time, there was a lot more on offer including hotdogs with the usual bacon rolls, sausage rolls and there was plenty of choices normally. I should also mention I have autism which is kind of vital.\n\n\nStory: One day, after one of my classes, I went to the canteen and waited in one of the three lines with it being for hot food. I was behind the deputy head and trying to look to see what was left since I was quite a bit behind and even said to myself \"I hope there is still some hotdogs left\" since I liked having a hotdog on Friday.\n\nThat was when the deputy head looked back and said \"There's nothing there for you\" and, due to my autism, I took it literally and just left the queue and went off to the extension of the school as that was where my next class was. I was never great with jokes and always took them literally like if someone said I was in trouble, I would believe it and be worried at what I did.\n\nAnyway, I'm now in my maths class after the bell went off and a few minutes into it, the deputy head knocks on the door and asks to see me. He wondered why I wasn't in the queue anymore and I explained to him that he said there wasn't anything there. He said he was just joking around and offered to let me go back to the canteen to go get something. I refused since, in my mind, there wouldn't be much I'd want and I would be wasting 5-10 minutes in a class I really struggled with plus I wouldn't be able to explain it.\n\nI should mention that, after the confrontation and him saying it was a joke, I did start crying, high school was hell for me so I guess it all piled up at the time and the deputy head did say for me to wait after class as they would get something for me. I didn't believe it considering his past action before I went back into class. I imagine people were looking at me but the teacher did give me some tissues and didn't ask me any questions.\n\nAt the end of class, I waited for a minute but he never showed up and so I had to rush to next classroom which was on the opposite side of the main school which was History. I believe 20 minutes into the class, the deputy head found it and walked over to give me a bag containing two different sandwiches, a bottle of water and some grapes.\n\nI got a lot of questioning looks and my friend asked what I got and I just said quietly as I put it next to my bag \"I don't know why I got this...\" but I never threw it away and after my last class, I just went home as it was the end of the day and aside from one sandwich, I did eat it all.\n\n\nHowever, thinking back on it recently, I really feel like I was in the wrong for taking a simple joke so seriously and I feel like I might have unintentionally guilt tripped the deputy head without realizing it. As for the deputy head, I think he knew I should have something to eat since it was a lot of time to go without anything to eat or drink so that was probably their reason (about 6-7 hours) but still...\n\nTLDR: I took a joke seriously and left the canteen without food. The deputy head told me it was a joke after taking me out of class and did offer solutions with me leaving class for time but I refused. They then said to wait after class but I didn't, thinking it was another joke and not trusting but he did give me a bag of food in my next class.\n\nAITA for that situation in the past?",

Grandparents dead, no contact with any other family members. Me, my two brothers, and her are the extent of the family.\n\nSo let me start this off by saying that my mother is dying. She has probably a month to live, and that's being hopeful. I'm not going to bother going into the details, and if I'm being quite honest, I'm not 100% sure of all of them. Apparently it's common for patients with it to have heart attacks or strokes, and after she had one stroke she asked that if she had another one to not help her and let her go. I'm not certain if the hospital is allowed to do that, but that was her request (the reason I'm not sure of all the details is because I'm not at the hospital with her. My older brother stays with her, and me and my other brother try to make it to any important news sharing from the doctor. \n\nWhen we were younger, my mother always said she wanted to see all of us settle down and start a family with someone we loved, so we could have what she never got to. Both of my older brothers succeeded and made her happy with that, but I have not. However, I have been in an extremely casual relationship for the past year. I'm talking basically a FWB type thing but slightly more serious. We've gone out on dates with other people in that time with no jealousy, but if either of us ever wanted to maybe make things more serious, we'd be open to the possibility of it. I've brought her home to holidays and such at home, but my mom is aware of how casual we are. \n\nSo with my mother's wish she always expressed when we were younger, and the current... situation, I've been considering telling my mom that my \"girlfriend\" and I are engaged, so that she can die at least thinking I'm on my way to creating the life she always wanted for me. When I told my brothers my idea, they had different responses. The oldest said I was an asshole for even considering manipulating our mother, but the other understands where I'm coming from and would be okay with me doing it, even if he wouldn't do it if he was in my situation. I also talked to my \"girlfriend\" and she said she would do it if I thought it was for the best. I'm just worried that if I do my oldest brother will think I'm an asshole and resent me for it, and honestly I'm not too sure if it's the best idea myself.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA?",

It's Super Bowl Sunday and the Lunar New Year (we're Vietnamese) is this coming Tuesday, so I thought it would be nice to spend some time with them. \n\nAs a full-time student and a part-time worker, I called out weeks ahead of time so I could make this visit. That being said, since I didn't have work this weekend, I thought that it'd be nice to finish up on this portfolio I'm working on since I don't normally get this much freetime during the week. For this portfolio I needed 10 of my best design pieces, a cover letter, and 2 essays. This seems pretty standard, but I'm taking this application very seriously as the program accepts only 30 students per year. And unfortunately this is something I have to do on the side, since my current classes and work are also a priority. Therefore I also had a couple of assignments to complete this weekend as well.\n\nSo on Friday night and all of Saturday, I basically worked my ass off doing as much work as I could, so I could do some more and on Sunday and be finished by the time the game kicks off. But earlier today, as I was still doing my homework the door bell rang and I discovered that my parents invited friends and family over for lunch and to hang out during the Super Bowl. This was something my parents didn't tell me about as I was expecting to have some alone time with them later tonight when we're watching the Super Bowl and having dinner. Since I was still busy with my work I kept myself shut in my room and didn't bother making menial small talk. \n\nIt wasn't until a bit when my parents came into my room and asked me to come out and hang out for a bit. I kindly declined, since I thought they would understand my circumstances. But after that, they would come back every 5 or so minutes to get me to come out and get some lunch despite how busy I was. But even then, I was indecent and still in my sleep wear, since trying to finish up my assignments was the first thing I did when I got up this morning. After a few more attempts, I finally snapped and raised my voice at them, enough to where (though not intentional) everyone in the kitchen and living room could hear me. I basically told my parents to leave me alone to let me do my homework and that I'll come out whenever I'm finished. They left, then my mom came back, brought food to my room, and has left me alone for the last hour or so. All I wanted to do was finish my work and watch the Super Bowl with my mom and dad, but I feel terrible about it as it must be embarrassingly awkward for their guests.\n\nOne half of me says yes I am the asshole, while the other says it was justified. Needless to say, I definitely could have handled the situation a lot better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tldr:** \n\nI came home to visit my mom and dad for the weekend, with a shit ton of homework due on Sunday along with portfolio work I needed to do to apply for a very competitive undergrad program. They had guests come over to watch the Super Bowl and celebrate the Lunar New Year, which I was not told about. After my dad was becoming very insistent on me coming out to have lunch with everyone, I raised my voice at him and told him to leave me alone so I could do my work.",

If I see the trash is full, I take it out. Every now and again I'll go ahead and clean an entire room, but I don't feel the need to announce when I clean. I especially don't announce it if all I've done is wipe down the stove or counters. \n\nA couple of my roommates on the other hand, make it known when they clean something, which is fine, but it's how they say it that annoys me. For example, one of my roommates cleaned the kitchen and ended the text with telling us to keep up with dishes for the rest of the semester. We're all guilty of occasionally letting dishes rack up, but telling us to keep up with them for the rest of the semester rubbed me the wrong way. I hand wash all my dishes almost immediately after using them because I know if I don't, I will forget about them. So typically, it's not my dishes that rack up. Or in some instances, they'll be passive aggressive after they've cleaned up. I think the thing that gets to me the most is that they just assume I don't clean. I don't expect anyone to assume it was me that cleaned the kitchen if I don't say so, but they'll just assume someone else did and then jump to a conclusion. \n\nLast year I lived with different roommates and never had any issues with not being clean. I did the same thing I do now and never had any issues. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I don't say anything when they send these texts, but I just want to make sure I'm not getting in my own head. My thought process is that we all live here, we all clean. We're just doing what we're supposed to do so why make a big deal out of it?

We know American men who have lived in the Philippines who said tons of women their desperately want an American husband so they can live in the US, so we strongly believe that's what's going on here.

I have no problem with my friends or anyone high but heâ€™s the worst when heâ€™s high. I used to smoke but iâ€™m 3 months sober. He recently tried pushing me to take a hit when we were all hanging out on the weekend. I told him no about 4-5 times and he proceeds to ask why.

The way she acted around me was always a little off, and Jim definitely noticed too. But after Jim moved, things started to get...weird. It started when she made a passing comments about how she would date me or how attractive she thought I was. I didn't think much of it at first, because she's an inordinately nice person, and I figured she was just trying to raise my spirits after my past relationship. Because we're good friends, we message each a lot, and she always tells me how I'm pretty much her closest friend. The second to last time we hung out, we were watching a movie, and she decided to lean up to me and cuddle. Well, no big deal, I figured-after all, I think two friends can cuddle without it being sexual, and have with other female friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell at this point its pretty obvious that some sexual tension was building. The last time I hung out with her, we both got *extremely* drunk. She made some comments about how hard she was trying to not make out with me or take things further. Now, even in my borderline black-out levels of drunkenness, I had zero intention of taking things further, as I believe that would be incredibly scummy and immoral. However, by the end of the night we ended up cuddling in bed together-and I mean *really* cuddling. In the morning when I sobered up, I felt really bad about the whole situation. I thought i made that pretty clear, but she has a habit of not talking about these kinda things and acting like nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell a couple days ago, Jim was talking to me and told me that Ashley had \"a thing\" with another close friend of ours (this one we'll call Bob). All I really know is that she spent two nights over at Bob's house, and he then later texted Jim and told him that he \"didn't want to go behind his back\" and that he and Ashley were planning on having \"a thing\". Neither Jim nor I were fully sure on what he meant by that, but he didn't want me to talk to her about it, as he doesn't want her to know he told me and didn't keep it between him and Bob. He said he was OK with it but that he didn't understand why Bob would be OK with it. While I'm almost positive that they did not have sex, I am 100% sure that some wicked intense cuddling was happening, and maybe some slightly sexual stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAshley never told me about any of this, and obviously has no intention to. Oddly enough, I feel used and cheap. Maybe I shouldn't, but I feel like she was kinda toying with me. I'm a pretty emotional person, so suppose I felt like we just had developed a closer bond, and the fact that she does shit with Bob  within the a month kinda hurts. She wont tell me about it because she knows it will hurt me. While I had no intention of trying things with her, the fact that she would do all this weird flirty stuff with me, not really talk about it, and then spend two nights at one of my close friend's house doing god knows what makes me feel used. I don't want to paint her in a bad light, though, as we are extremely close, and she has never been anything but overtly nice to me, and I have confided things to her that I would never  tell anyone else. That being said, with this whole situation, I told her that I no longer want to hang out with her 1 on 1, and I really don't feel like speaking to her at the moment. I know that I said earlier that two people can cuddle without it being sexual, but this whole situation with Bob feels off to me. Idk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling used and being mad at her?",

It came time for me to go up and talk to the judge and DA to see if I couldn't get the ticket dismissed or bumped down so it wouldn't affect my time with enlisting. He asked if I wanted him to come up with me and I said yes, but let me do the talking I want you there as support (because yes he is very much who I look to if I get nervous or stumble) he agreed he wouldn't say anything. So the judge asked me if I wanted any documents explaining what unreasonable speed is due to it being a vague area. I was about to say no when my father starting viciously shaking his head yes, so I said yes. The judge said it may take up to 30 days for them to get some documentation from the State Trooper explaining, he asked me if there was a date I would prefer to come in on and just before I was about to explain my situation and that I didn't need the document I just need the whole court process over with so I could continue with the recruitment process my dad just started talking and explaining everything and said we could talk to the DA to lower the ticket. My dad then proceeded to not even let me talk to the DA and instead took complete control of the situation for me.\n\nAfter we had left the court room I confronted him saying that was exactly what I didn't want him to do.

I just got quiet and didn't say anything and he just kept pushing the issue saying he doesn't understand why I'm upset. I was set off by this and told him that he always does this, he needs to step back and let me fight my own battles. He didn't understand this and got extremely upset with me over this, explained that he only wants to help me.

Leash law is in the surrounding area outside the property as well as mandatory in the complex. \nLast August someone moved down the hall from us with a lab puppy. No biggie, it was a small puppy and they had it off leash every now and then. He was just a little chonk so no harm, I suppose. \n\nHowever, now he is almost a fully grown dog and I'd guess around 80 pounds. It's pretty much daily that he's off leash and running around the apartment with my neighbor. My neighbor relies on an electric collar to make his dog behave, which works only after he's repeatedly called him and shocked him multiple times.\n\nTo avoid problems, I try to time when I go out with my dogs bc I don't want to be caught on the stairs/in the hallway at the same time with mine and his dog, but we've had run-ins before where I quickly have to duck away with mine.\n I'm not going to act like my dogs are perfect, one is reactive but I'm working on him. The other is pretty okay with other dogs as long as they don't invade her space. Even so, they are always on leash so I can control them, unlike my neighbor who relies on his dog listening to him and his collar.\n\nI contacted the front office (last October) about this happening and they told me to take a picture of them and email it. At this point, I've emailed them over a dozen times and I believe they have fined him once but it hasn't changed this problem.\n\nTonight we had a run-in and his dog was very close to mine. He finally got his dog away after shocking it a few times. I hadn't said anything to him until this point about it, but I spoke up and said \"Hey, he's a pretty big dog, he probably needs a leash.\"\nHe was pretty dismissive, \"Oh he's fine, he's just training.\"\n\nI have already reported him this week so I'm not sure if the office is already planning on doing something, but am I an asshole for continuing to report him?",

It raises my anxiety to the point where my heart is beating like rabbit's, blood pressure is high, and sleeping gets pretty difficult. \n\n*Anyway, it's absurd, and I know that. Just giving some context as to why this drives me fucking bonkers.*\n\nMy partner says I should just bang on the ceiling when they do it, and they'll knock it off -- but I can't bring myself to do that, because I feel like nobody responds positively to that. (Why the hell should they?) \n\nSo. Would I be the asshole if I: \n1) Took my partner's passive-aggressive suggestion to just bang back at them. \n2) Took the time to go up to the apartment, introduce myself, and ask them to pretty-please stop drumming on the floor. At least in the fucking bedroom. At least at night. Please. \nor 3) (The one I'm least inclined to do) File a complaint with building management. \n\nI think #2 is the least asshole-ish option, but my partner says it'd be weird. \n\nSo, internet -- WIBTA?

I'm now 29 and moved back into my parents house. I like to have a nice clean house so i keep my room clean and sometimes go on cleaning sprees where I'll clean the whole house.\n\nWe have had some drama in the past because of this. Basically, I try to clean something and my parents freak out, I mean like full blown insanity. I don't even clean it, I just suggest I might try cleaning it and ask if their OK with it. Its at this point that they just start yelling and say \"get out, get out right now, its our stuff don't touch it.\" And I try to remain calm but for some reason I don't instantly comply with their demands because in the moment I just freeze rather than instantly walk out of the room. their yelling gets louder and more aggressive and angrier which ends up making me mad so i may lose my temper and say something like \"fine, you want to yell at me for doing nothing... i might as well clean something\" I realize this is an asshole thing to do but I havenâ€™t done this in a while but done it before so I guess this is what my parents are worried about.\n\nI hadn't cleaned up their part of the house like their room or their office in years and tonight I finished cleaning my room and since it was my moms birthday (my mom usually actually likes when I clean but I think since my dad hates it so much she agrees with him) and they don't have a problem with just dusting their problem is when it comes to moving their stuff around/organizing. So I figured I would do some dusting, no problem, everyone is happy.\n\nmy mom comes to see the room, everything is fine. I ask her nicely \"Can I straighten out this pile of papers? Just straighten out not move or anything\" She says well OK. So I start straightening out the papers. Then my dad comes up like a tyrant lunatic, doesn't even know whats going on and starts with the \"get out! get out! get out!\" And like I said I just freeze so they keep getting louder. my mom instantly sides with my dad and everyone's yelling at me and i'm generally calm and waiting for them to stop yelling so loud so I can decide what to do.\n\nSo yes, I probably shouldn't mess with my parents stuff in their room.\n\nI probably should leave their room the second they tell me to.\n\nAnd yes I should probably move out and get my own house.\n\nBut I still have the aching desire to make their house perfect.\n\nIn the times when I've managed to clean things it in the past and created trouble none of their stuff is ever lost and they usually really like how everything is so clean in the end. So sometimes I think maybe I should just let them get angry and clean their room for the greater good. Well lately I don't (past 15 years) because they are so insane about it.\n\nSo am I the asshole? and what should I do about still wanting to make the house clean? or is that a question for [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice)",

Some necessary context to help you decide if Iâ€™m wrong here - \n\nIâ€™ve never liked her fiancÃ©, even before they got together. I was vocal about my disdain, up until they started dating.

Now to the actual question. \n\nMy parents are not good at planning parties. Her fiancÃ©â€™s parents are far away. My MIL is wonderful at party planning and is a saint, so my own mother asked her for help. But my MIL and I live a few hours from them. \n\nFor the past 4-5 months I have been transporting wedding items back and forth from my parentsâ€™ house to my MILâ€™s house. I travel for work, so sometimes these transfers have taken place during my work trips (which isnâ€™t out right prohibited, but it does make me feel sketchy. Which I expressed to my mother and she blew me off). These trips arenâ€™t super often, but probably one or two every other week. \n\nNow the wedding is three days away and there is still a lot to be transported. I have already volunteered to take off work Friday and drive down really early in the morning to get everything there. The wedding isnâ€™t until Saturday. My sister just texted me on behalf of my mother asking me to leave work early on Thursday as well so that I can get there sooner and make sure we have everything we need. \n\nI really donâ€™t want to do that. Iâ€™m taking my vacation time for this already. And Iâ€™ve already taken lots of time out of work to make trips for them. I want to tell my mom (who works from home) to make the drive herself tomorrow if she wants everything there so soon. But I am having a hard time deciding if Iâ€™m just being really selfish and mean because I already donâ€™t want this wedding to happen, or if theyâ€™re being unreasonable asking me to leave work a day and a half early for items they could have retrieved themselves much sooner. \n\nSo, AITA?

One guy \\[\\~20\\] in the discord has been having some \"financial issues\" and has know my girlfriend for about half a year. Around August of LAST YEAR he asked her for money to buy some souvenirs at some PAX convention because he didn't have any money left over from his airfare/hotel. Being the incredibly nice person my girlfriend is, she gave him about $250 for a total. It turns out that within a week he's purchased some new video games. Suspicious, me and a couple friends figured he just used the money she gave him to buy them. He claimed he gets \"grants\" from his school that average around $2000 or something and he would pay her back yet come September. He then asked her for another $250 to buy a Razer mouse and keyboard that was \"on sale\" and could get it cheap and that he would pay her back. Again, being the nice person my girlfriend is, she gave him the money. Welllll come September and he says he needs until October. Alright...getting suspicious again, but I try to stay out of it because I hate internet/Discord drama. So he then gets back to her around the end of October/early November and pays her HALF claiming he would \"give her the rest plus interest.\" Unsurprisingly, he asks for another $250 for reasons my girlfriend won't tell me because I've expressed serious anger about it before. He then tells her sometime December that \"plans have changed\" and he's going to be joining up with the US military, whatever the hell that has to do with anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's now late February THIS YEAR and he has yet to pay her back. It came up again in a conversation with her and in a blind rage I went on to Discord and messaged him saying stuff like \"you're a pathetic adult,\" \"stop leeching off girls you've never met,\" and \"if you need financial help get it in real life not Discord strangers.\" He replied obviously angry saying stuff like \"You're so tough behind a screen\" and \"You don't know the full story so shut the fuck up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I don't know the full story and frankly I don't care but if you need help you shouldn't be leeching off of someone you've never met to purchase expensive and unnecessary stuff and claiming to pay them back. Someone like him has no right to ask for MORE MONEY claiming to pay them back after already $500 in debt to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Girlfriend is now pissed at me because she got angry texts from him saying things like \"Keep your boyfriend in check\" and \"I don't need his shit when he doesn't know anything about it.\" She is in school and said she doesn't want anymore drama. Should I have just stayed out of it or was I in the right to get involved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Guy asks for $700 from my girlfriend and says he will pay her back but hasn't in in about 6 months, got pissed off any messaged him on Discord.

I came to a university about an hour and a half from my home and my boyfriend from back home would come to visit every weekend. \n\nFor some background, my parents have always been kind of ...weird? I hesitate to call them outright abusive, but going out to see my friends would always result in them making me feel guilty about not staying home with my family. Iâ€™d be expected to watch my sister (8) and brother (6) all summer long and during the week.\n\nThey were always specifically weird about me dating. My best friend when I was in 9th grade asked me out and I said yes. Yes we were both girls; yes Iâ€™m bi. Anyway, my parents flipped actual shit. I had come out to them, but I donâ€™t think it was about that. They wanted me to explain why EXACTLY I liked my friend and wouldnâ€™t accept the answers I would give. They cut me off from my only 2 friends and put me on â€œsuicide watchâ€? (my mom is a psych nurse). When I told my psychiatrist I felt depressed and had considered suicide, my parents yelled at me and told me it wasnâ€™t that big of a deal. \n\nFlash forward to the fall of junior year, I start talking more and more to this guy that had always been part of my friend group but I never got to know that well. I tell my parents I want to date him. I immediately am told that Iâ€™ll never be left alone with him and that heâ€™s not good enough for me and this and that. I broke it off with him quickly due to the intense pressure they had been putting on the relationship. Not too long afterwards, we started dating again because thatâ€™s what horny 16 year olds do. It had been kind of rough, but once he got his own car, we were able to sneak around pretty well. \n\nMy parents always suspected we were together. I told them we were casually dating but not official and I honestly think they have forgotten I told them that. My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years as of October though, and Iâ€™m honestly really happy in my relationship. \n\nFlash forward to early October this year: my parents find a corner of one of those sex ed condoms in my room back home and call me while Iâ€™m studying in the library. Iâ€™m essentially told Iâ€™m a whore (which Iâ€™ve actually been called due to my being on birth control because of suspected endometriosis), to send my phone (which my step father pays for... I wasnâ€™t ever able to get a job back home because I was expected to babysit and no one would teach me how to drive) back to my parents, and that my parents wouldnâ€™t be sending me the prescription for my Vyvanse (which Iâ€™ve been on for about 6 years for ADHD). I was accused of having sex in the house â€” something that would have been nearly impossible due to my parentâ€™s schedules and also I just wouldnâ€™t do that. \n\nNeedless to say, university was pretty difficult while I was unmedicated. I also got a statement from my school telling me that I owed them some $5,000. Seeing as my parents had effectively disowned me and my school wasnâ€™t going to let me register for classes next semester because I had literally $200 in my bank account, I stopped going to classes and found a job. \n\nI was applying for a job at a coffee shop and an insurance agent from across the street told me to come in to her office and sheâ€™d interview me right then and there for a job as a telemarketer. Long story short, I ended up being pretty decent so she paid for me to take the licensing exam and Iâ€™m currently just waiting for the state to process my application. \n\nMy boyfriend from back home went to the local community college because heâ€™s going to be able to go for 2 years debt free and then transfer to a university for comp sci. Heâ€™s moving down here on Friday (and Iâ€™m moving in with him) and heâ€™s gonna go to the community here. Before you tell me how silly that is because weâ€™re only 18, trust me I know, but really there wasnâ€™t any other way I could get an apartment that I can afford before I get kicked out of my dorm because itâ€™s the end of the semester. His parents are helping us out so much and I will be eternally grateful for them. \n\nMy parents wanted me to come home for thanksgiving. Apparently my mom (39) has been having seizures? My family has a history of weird made-up sounding medical conditions and Iâ€™m honestly not even sure whatâ€™s real or not in regards to that. I didnâ€™t go home if that isnâ€™t obvious. I also donâ€™t think I want to come home for Christmas either. \n\nMy parents tell me itâ€™s not fair to my brother and sister that I donâ€™t come home, but I honestly fear for my safety if I were to go back home. My mom has filed a PFA against my step dad essentially for false imprisonment before and I honestly would have been able to do the same at least 3 times. \n\nTo be clear, my mom and I talk sporadically, but itâ€™s not like sheâ€™s offering to talk about whatâ€™s going on. They came down here after the incident to have dinner with my boyfriend and I go talk about what happened. It was actually terrible. They put my sister in the chair between him and I and they were essentially interrogating me the whole time. My step dad kept offering me money (which he wouldnâ€™t have actually given me) to break up with my boyfriend. My boyfriend isnâ€™t like a terrible person or anything. He was a decent student I high school and my friend group is really just d&amp;d and mtg nerds. I was very involved in high school (president of like 3 clubs) and he supported me every step of the way. My parents know all of this. \n\n\nI know there are probably gaps that I didnâ€™t fill in all the way, so feel free to ask questions. Iâ€™m also on mobile so idk if the formatting is gonna be weird or not. \n\nTl;dr: am I the asshole for not wanting to go home for the holidays after my parents disowned me?",

I have absolutely no clue what sized guards she used, what type of clippers, or anything to do with what I was paying her to do. A few weeks back I learned that she retired and my hair has been getting pretty shaggy since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a job interview tomorrow so I finally decided to find a new stylist. I went to my normal shop, sat in a new (to me) person's chair, and tried to explain what I wanted. I told her that I believed the sides were usually a 2.5-3 with the top longer because that's what I styled. I also said that I'd like to start with cleaning everything up and working down from there because I wanted to look good for my interview. I don't know where the miscommunication happened, but before I knew what was happening she popped on a 3 and did one long line right along the top of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short I sat there in silent rage as I lost all of my hair, paid, and walked out without leaving a tip. I talked to my buddy after calming down a bit and he says I should have tipped because she did her job and it was my fault for not better explaining or showing a picture of what I wanted.\n\nI understand the logic there and if I went to Great Clips I probably would've done just that and never would've made this post. The issue is that I pay $40 just for a basic cut at my barbershop and I feel that extra cost goes to having a stylist that knows better than to chop off large chunks of a customer's hair before making 100% sure that they understand the size they're asking for. On top of that, I clearly said a 3 on the side while keeping the top longer so why would I get a buzz cut out of that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is what I had](https://menhairstylist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/short-messy-hairstyles-for-men.jpg)\n\n[This is what I wanted](https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Spiked-Fringe-Textured-Top-High-Fade.jpg)\n\n[This is what I got](https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Number-4-Haircut-Buzz-Cut.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AItA for not tipping?

            "input": "Let me begin by stating I do not like dogs, but I like our friend/roommate so I was happy to put up with them. \n\nSo at the beginning of September, we moved in with a friend (I will call her Pat) who has two service dogs. These service dogs are not truly trained as service dogs. When moving in, Pat said she wanted the big room in the house so she could keep her dogs in there while she was at work. My wife and I agreed to this. We moved in, and she let the dogs roam around outside the room. We didn't mind, as they weren't bad or misbehaved in any way. Then the landlord didn't like the dogs being left outside the house, so she brought them inside and left them inside while she was away at work. \n\nOver the past two months, we have been coming home to find dog poop in the kitchen, hallway, and living room area. Not just in a single pile, but its normally spread out. It was one of the dogs in particular, so Pat said she would keep the dog in her room after a month of talking to her about it. We were happy and didn't mind the other dog being out as the second dog wasn't really a problem. Well, this week the second dog pooped TWICE in the house. The first time, my wife came home to it and there were over 10 spots where there was poo. The second time was 2 days ago. Pat had let out the two dogs in the morning. My wife got home and let out the second dog again. The dog peed outside, then came inside and pooped twice on the floor. My wife and I talked to each other about it, then she had to go to work. We messaged each other more about this via Telegram app, venting to each other our frustrations about this. We didn't say anything mean about our roommate, but just that this was her problem, and that she really needed to do something about the dogs pooping (mind you they have pooped in the house over 15 times in the past 2 months).\n\nThen last night we went out for a Thanksgiving dinner, and at the end of it I get a call from our roommate. In the past, I told her that if my computer is unlocked, she can use it to game or browse the internet or watch videos. I don't mind since she doesn't have her own. Well, I left Telegram open and she decided to read the messages between me and my wife. Again, we didn't insult her, we said nothing bad ABOUT her, just voiced our opinions that we hated having the dogs poop in the house and that we should talk to her again about this. She decided that she didn't like my wife and I \"talking trash behind her back, or talking behind her back at all\" and that she was going to move out. Today she began to move out her stuff from the house. \n\nWe have talked to her about the dog situation several times. She has brought up that she will get diapers for her dogs, or hire a dog walker. She has done none of those, stating she doesn't have a lot of money. But she goes out and eats a lot, spends money on weed (we do too, but not as much cuz she wont use edibles), buys new expensive wigs, and even bought a new mattress pad for her bed. She has friends who she borrows money from, but this doesn't seem to be as important. My wife and I are just very tired of coming home to find smelly dog shit everywhere, and we were just venting to each other about it. We of course don't share all of our feelings with her because we are roommates and we are trying to be nice and accommodating. We also don't want to keep bringing these things up over and over and over because then we feel we are nagging her. Are we the assholes for venting to each other and not just straight out complaining to her like she wanted us to?",

            "input": "  \n\nTLDR: My sister is angry because I suggested that instead of just shutting down the Go Fund Me her daughter started for her and sending the funds to the adoption agency because she changed her mind about adopting, she should post an update explaining this to the donors and giving them a chance to have their money returned if thatâ€™s what they wanted.\n\nIâ€™m going to try to keep this short but include everything that could be relevant. Iâ€™ve talked with a few people close to me about it and they say Iâ€™m NTA but I want to hear some objective opinions and maybe get some insight into what might be going on from people outside of the situation.\n\nMy sister, weâ€™ll call her Susan, is very angry with me/basically not talking to me after a conversation we had. Iâ€™m really hurt and donâ€™t understand why. Weâ€™ve had issues in the past but nothing we havenâ€™t gotten through, and I thought we were close.\n\nA while ago she decided to adopt a child from overseas, which can cost upwards of $35,000, and one of her daughters, weâ€™ll call her Lisa, started a Go Fund Me (GFM) to fund part of the cost of the adoption. In general I donâ€™t like GFM or the philosophy behind it. I think people should work for what they want, not ask other people to pay for it. Even though Iâ€™m a bleeding heart liberal in some ways, I have a Libertarian streak. \n\nHaving said that, itâ€™s not always black and white and when Lisa started a GFM for an emergency dental surgery that sounded very scary over a year ago, I contributed to it, and I contributed to Susanâ€™s adoption GFM in the last month because itâ€™s a really good cause and adoptions are ridiculously expensive, but mostly because I love my sister and wanted her to feel supported. So I contributed to the first one because I was afraid my niece was basically going to die without the surgery (it was a huge tumor inside of her mouth, or something along those lines), and I contributed to the adoption one for the reasons I already stated. I will never contribute to another GFM again as long as I live.\n\nSusan asked me to forward the GFM page to friends/put it on social media. I told her I donâ€™t have social media and she said what about Reddit? (because Iâ€™m always sending her stuff from Reddit). I told her Redditâ€™s not like that, or at least not the way I use it. But I was trying to think of different ways to help her raise money, like doing a raffle or a race or something. I wanted to do something more quickly though and ended up making a donation and sharing the link with several close friends, 5 of whom donated. This was very hard for me to do because I really, really donâ€™t like asking friends to do this kind of thing. Like I said I donâ€™t believe in the GFM mindset to begin with, and I donâ€™t like putting friends in the position of saying yes or no. But I did it for my sister despite feeling very awkward and uncomfortable, which I never told her about. So this might be importantâ€”she never had a clue how I feel about GFM, or knew that it was difficult for me to ask my friends. No reason to tell her that and make her feel bad. Either donate happily without complaint, or donâ€™t.\n\nFast forward to the conversation. We were talking on the phone about a week ago and she told me sheâ€™s been having a really hard time. Our whole family is sad right now because my other sisterâ€™s husband, our brother-in-law, an amazing, wonderful person, died unexpectedly three months ago. So weâ€™re all grieving for him and for my other sister. Our dad died last December too and even though (or because) I wasnâ€™t close to him, itâ€™s been hard, and Iâ€™m sure to differing degrees that was hard on Susan, too. But the bottom line is Susan has been really sad and emotional. The reasons behind why she wanted to adopt and why she ultimately decided not to after all are related to trauma from her past that sheâ€™s still working through. There is a lot more to this but the bottom line is sheâ€™s having a hard time, and we talked about all of this for maybe over an hour. \n\nAs we were getting off the phone, I said â€œThis is obviously not the most important thing about this situation, but can I ask what youâ€™re doing to the GFM?â€? Itâ€™s in quotes because I worded it very carefully in my head first because I didnâ€™t want her to feel I was discounting all the emotional things she's going through. She said that Lisa was the one who set it up and they were just going to shut it down and donate the money raised to the same adoption agency for the same child, but for the next person in line who wanted to adopt him. \n\nI suggested that they do a final post explaining briefly that the adoption wasnâ€™t going to happen and what was going to happen to the money, so people would know. I told her I did not want my own money back at all, but that it would be nice to offer people their money back if thatâ€™s what they preferred, since although it was going to almost the same thing, itâ€™s not exactly the same thing. Susan really didnâ€™t seem to understand this and said that there was no way to make everyone happy. That even if they did make a final post explaining what they were doing, 50% of the people would still be unhappy. I said that might be true, but it doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not a good thing to do. I said that itâ€™s nice when people donate money to let them know what happened to it, especially if what they initially donated forâ€”in this case Susan adopting a childâ€”doesnâ€™t happen. \n\nSusan said she didn't think this way. That when she donates to a cause, she knows she's \"pure of heart\" and she has good karma and she doesn't worry about what ends up happening to the money. I said that's not how I approach donating at all. That when I donate to a cause, I'm \"pure of heart,\" too, but that I expect the money to go to what I was donating to and if it doesn't, I think that's fraud. Obviously she and I are on very different spectrums when it comes to charity, and maybe just in our approach to life? I don't know, maybe this is why I'm not understanding why she's so upset.\n\nI said that for instance what about the GFM that Lisa started for the oral surgery over a year ago? The last I heard, as of a couple of months ago when I last asked Susan, Lisa hadnâ€™t had the surgery, and I hadnâ€™t heard any updates. My sister said Lisa had just had the surgery yesterday. I am wondering if this is what upset my sister, that I was asking about that. But all I was saying was that people like updates and to know how the money was used. So she said she was going to check with Lisa and see if there was a way to return peopleâ€™s money for the adoption GFM and I told her there was no rush. I told her again I did not want my money back, but I wanted to offer my friends their money back in case thatâ€™s what they wanted. \n\nSusan did not seem to understand AT ALL why I was so concerned about my friends. But I felt responsible. Susan said â€œBut all you did was send them a link to tell them this was available to donate to if they wanted to.â€? I said no, thatâ€™s not the way it is at all. They could give their money to a million causes. They only donated to this one because Iâ€™m their friend and they care about me, and by virtue of that they care about her. So I felt responsible. She did not get that, not a bit.\n\nSo 5 minutes after we get off the phone, I realize none of this is necessary. I call her back and tell her I want to do the donation to the charity, so I will pay my friends back, explain the adoption isnâ€™t going through and so we wanted to return the money. But it will be out of my pocket because I am totally happy to donate to this cause. But my sister doesnâ€™t want to do that. She says she wants to talk to Lisa. Maybe 15 minutes later she texts me and says sheâ€™s sending me the money and a few minutes later I have the full amount in my accountâ€”the money I donated (even though I said I didnâ€™t want it back) and the money my friends donated. I emailed her that I got the money but I donâ€™t know why she returned my donation , too, when I told her not to. I also didnâ€™t tell her to return my friendsâ€™ moneyâ€”I just wanted to offer it back to them and let them have a say. They probably would have said not to worry about it. \n\nSo I feel like by handling it all this way she twisted what I asked for. I didnâ€™t ask for my money back. I didnâ€™t even ask for my friendsâ€™ money back. Just to offer to give it back if they wanted it. Why was that so bad? Why is it so hard to do a final post telling everyone who was kind and generous enough to donate what happened to their money? \n\nI told her about the site Go Fraud Me and how people use GFM to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars by doing things like lying and saying they have cancer. Not that sheâ€™s doing that! Of course not. Just that it makes people cynical. I said in the email that itâ€™s my own personal conviction that when you accept money from people for a charitable cause, you have to be a good steward of those peopleâ€™s money. I said it that way so she wouldnâ€™t feel I was judging her. Itâ€™s MY personal conviction.\n\nBut still I felt really bad because I know sheâ€™s going through an emotional time, and so I dropped off a really beautiful bouquet of flowers for her later that day. She wasnâ€™t home so I left them on her porch and texted her letting her know I left her something. The flowers were meaningful because she told me during the conversation about how this summer she made everyone a bouquet of flowers from her garden and not one for herself, and this is related to how she never takes care of herself. So I got her fresh flowers. About four hours later she hadnâ€™t responded so I texted and asked if she got the flowers. A couple hours later she responded very coldly. â€œYes. Thank you. I donâ€™t want to talk and want to be alone.â€? So Iâ€™ve left her alone but I feel her cold treatment of me is really unfair.\n\nAll I did was say that people who give you money o",

Says I prefer my wifes family to my own. My Dad sent me a text today that says \"Your daughters grandparents lose out to an aunt.\" As if there were some sort of relational hierarchy. I also told them that I think it would be easiest to let my daughter stay the night another weekend and just let my SIL take her this weekend. So not just \"no\" (they were very excited that this was the first time my daughter was to spend the night with them), I did offer a solution as well.\n\nThis is all compounded by my family feeling like we tend to favor her family, which I believe is because we kind of do because we don't fight with them. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR\n\nAccidentally double booked both my Sister in law and mother and sister to watch my daughter for a weekend.

He also was definitely faster than me, as a general rule I don't give valuables to strangers who I think can outrun me. \n\nAfter my denial, he said \" I understand your concerned for your safety, but you're also an ignorant pussy\" and continues slagging me off for 5 minutes. He then proceeds to threaten me by punching me in the face. One of the lines I recall and will deeply reside in my mind is \"I TELL YOU MY GIRLFRIEND IS BEING RAPED AND YOU DONT HELP ME!\" which looking back now, I should've. He then says if I don't leave the restaurant he'll punch me, so I left. I walk around the restaurant to make sure he doesn't hurt the cashier, (I was the only one there). After a while the cashier gives him a phone and I hear yelling . Strange thing was he didn't call the police.\n\nHe stated that I shouldn't be around him, whilst he was having a fag near the entrance, I ask if I am now allowed inside to collect my order, to which he says yes after asking multiple times.\nWhilst I collect my order I am told he lived upstairs.\n\nI think I'm an arsehole. I think what I should have done was hold his phones for ransom whilst he uses mine. I was stressed, and put under pressure. In my only defense, I thought it was a  mugging, I don't ever trust strangers and he did come across as really dodgy. The area where I live is renowned for crooks, high speed chases and general criminal activity ",

My roommate tried to fill the void but it wasn't enough for her. On many occasions, she has said hurtful things to him on why they should break up. Things like \"Give me reasons why we should stay together\" or \"You may think we have good conversations but i don't\". Everytime she comes over to see him, she ends up just watching youtube videos or they end up spooning for 2 hours. Ive heard their conversations and there are many awkward silences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has dumped him 8 times. Every time it is because something upset her and he did not respond appropriately. She then dumps him and blocks him on FB. A week or two goes by and then she realizes that shes lonely and misses him. He always welcomes her back with open arms. Its gotten so bad that I can predict correctly within 3 days the next time they break up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey share the same major but next year, she will be working across the country.

My boyfriend of about 5 months graduated last May with his BA in history. He's currently working a sales job that he mostly likes, but doesn't love.\n\nThat out of the way, here's the situation. Boyfriend loves history, and intends to go to grad school soon with the intention of getting a PhD in history and becoming a professor. Thing is, the job situation for history professors is [atrociously terrible](http://www.megankatenelson.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/AHA-Today-November-16-2017-1.png). I know everyone in the humanities (or the arts, for that matter) thinks they can beat the odds, but I don't think he understands how bad the odds are. I also think he doesn't understand what grad school is actually like, and he's expressed a very rose-tinted view of being a professor (he called it \"a six-figure job where you get summers off\", which is inconsistent both with actual salary data and with my personal experience).  This is something he's really passionate about, but I think he's setting himself up for a lot disappointment and heartbreak.\n\nI know that, as his girlfriend, I should be supportive. We aren't financially tied, so it doesn't hurt me financially if he goes into debt. Even though I love him a lot, I know that realistically its unlikely we'll be together by the time he finishes he finishes his degree (things change, people move, etc). I just see what dismal prospects lie down this path, and I don't want that for him.\n\nThere's also the issue that as a history major myself, I also wanted to be a professor before my parents convinced me against it and diverted me to a (hopefully) more realistic career path. It's not something I want anymore, other than in the sense of, \"in a perfect world...\", but I feel like if the topic comes up I have to lie and say that I was never interested in to job, or I have to a hypocrite and say that I want something for him that I don't think is a good idea for me. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I expressed my concerns for him, or should I just keep my mouth shut?",

It been 7 years, in those 7 years, I should be in school and learn something. Honestly, it was my fault too. If I had just try to search for a school myself when I was 11, maybe I couldn't end up like this. Even so, I wonder will he pay for it? Last time I asked....he lied to me and i never end up going to a school for another year.\n\nI feel like i'm demanding him so much. But people are telling me they, his family, took more than we did. But still, aren't i too much? \n\nI just want to get a stable life and able to go school. Get a job and leave this place with my mom. I thought of bringing him along, but it will upsets mom. He might try to get me into something too...like mom said he did it to her. Get something from me.\n\nI thought of giving him money each month when I get a job. After all...he's my father and i'm grateful...he even give us money. It may be hundreds of dollar like 200 and expect us to live on that for the whole month, but it's still better than nothing.\n\nMom wants revenge. BY selling the house and leaving him.

But for someone like him, wasting all money on gamble and have little savings...I wonder if he is going to suffer. If he is...I feel bad. BUt there seems to be no way of settling these... he'll never listen and won't quit gamble if i recommend him to do so.\n\nAM I an A-H for wanting things and him paying for all of it and still leave him?\n\nAlso if you read all these, wow...I...thank you.

TL;DR at end.)\n\nIâ€™m a chef, I hired this guy as my sous almost two years ago.  He has diabetes.  Heâ€™s always sick, especially when itâ€™s really inconvenient, like when I am out of town or when we have really busy weeks with lots of banquets or offsite events.  I brought it up to him in the past, if he thought stress exacerbated it, because whenever we were really busy and I needed his help, boom! in the hospital.\n\nEventually, I had to take him off of salary bc he was missing too much work and I told him, you know I donâ€™t wanna fire you, I understand you donâ€™t have control over this, blah blah blah, but Iâ€™m not paying you a salary when I canâ€™t depend on you.  So I put him on an hourly wage instead and I promoted one of my other cooks as a sort of junior sous chef so I had a fall back for 1st sous chefs eventual sick days and to ease the stress on 1st sous so he wasnâ€™t pushing himself so hard.\n\nHeâ€™s got this stomach thing where it goes into paralysis and wonâ€™t digest the food sitting in this stomach and then when it starts pumping (?) again and drops all of the old food into his gut he gets really ill.  Apparently this happens with diabetes?  I have also, more than once, found him passed out on the floor of the employee room when heâ€™s gone up for a shot.  When he gets sick and goes home I wonâ€™t hear from him for days and have to contact his sons to see if heâ€™s dead.  I ask him about it after and he says he just comes to after days and has to look at a calendar to see how long he missed. \n\n1st sous chef has had this illness for 20 years.  He refuses to go to the doctor for regular treatment or even when heâ€™s ill.  When I say â€œin the hospitalâ€? itâ€™s because he gets so fucking sick that his kids call 911 (theyâ€™re all grown adults BTW).  He does take insulin, but thatâ€™s as far as any self treatment goes.  He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.  I know lots of other people with diabetes, my aunt for example has never ever had to go to the doctor for complications due to diabetes, neither did my friend in high school (and he was 17 and an idiot), and neither does my CURRENT prep cook, who ALSO has diabetes.  Because they take care of themselves! My prep cook brings himself little sugar free cookies and bananas to work with him and eats these cactus tortillas bc they have less sugar than corn. So itâ€™s increasingly frustrating to deal with his constant sickness, not because of the inconvenience to me and the business, I solved that with 2nd sous chef, but because weâ€™re all watching this dude kill himself in front of us and heâ€™s the most stubborn mother fucker in the world and itâ€™s breaking my heart.\n\nOk, so last Friday Iâ€™m up in my office doing some paperwork and go into the kitchen to check on things and 1st sous is gone, 2nd sous says he got really sick and left an hour earlier.  No big deal, weâ€™re extra staffed with a new guy training so Iâ€™m not worried about it and leave at my normal time.  Saturday 1st sous is a no show, I text and call, but as usual hear nothing.  2nd Sous coincidentally lives with 1st, so I ask him if heâ€™s okay and he says he hasnâ€™t talked to him that he was asleep when he got home the night before and was still sleeping when he left for work in the morning.  My days off are Sun. and Mon. and 2nd sous is going out of town to visit his fam for Thanksgiving, so I assume Iâ€™m going to be working on both of my days off to cover for 1st sous.  Câ€™est le vie, theyâ€™re super slow days so boring, but no biggie.\n\nTuesday comes and 1st sous comes in to talk to me.  We go outside and he tells me he found a diabetic ulcer on his foot and that it started to â€œstinkâ€? on Sunday.  He refuses to go the doctor bc he knows theyâ€™re going to tell him to amputate.  His plan is to cut off the dead tissue himself, apparently heâ€™s done this before (â€¦) and his friend gave him some weird oil shit thatâ€™s supposed to kill the infection before it can get into his blood stream (I forgot to mention, he says he is allergic to all antibiotics) I try and talk him out of it and tell him prosthesis have improved, heâ€™ll be able to do everything he can now, no one will even be able to tell, but he wonâ€™t even consider it because HE WONâ€™T STOP DRINKING AND SMOKING.  Like itâ€™s his fucking life blood, I was like, what?!  You wonâ€™t stop smoking to have more time with your kids?   And he shrugged and said heâ€™s raised 5 good men and they donâ€™t need him.  Basically he wants me to give him two weeks to â€œget back to normal.â€?  In my opinion, he is not going to get back to normal.  He is going to ignore this until he gets blood poisoning and dies.  I told him that I think he shouldnâ€™t waste what time he has left working and that he should spend it with his kids and he said, yeah maybe.\n\nThis situation has been really stressful in a lot of ways, I really care about him and I obviously donâ€™t want him to fucking die and he was crying telling me and I was crying and it was all very awful.  After our talk he went back inside and drank a whiskey while I input invoices, so what can ya do, heâ€™s not going to change for anything including his own life.\n\nThe owner of my place told me that I canâ€™t fire him over this.  I said Iâ€™m not going to watch him commit suicide in front of me and thatâ€™s not fucking fair to the staff and that itâ€™s not doing him any favors allowing him to continue working.

It might seem callous, but I really donâ€™t want to let him back.  I honestly think it would be better to fire him because if he was unemployed he could get Medicaid, maybe hospice care, maybe die with some dignity instead of fainting in the bathroom at the bar after a long shift without eating.  Even in the event that he pulls off some sort of miraculous hobo surgery on himself and gets all the necrotic tissue out, how long until it happens again?  His kids are all moving away, 2nd sous is moving out of their house, whoâ€™s going to call 911 next time? I worried I'm being selfish.  One of my cooks pointed out that maybe he really really loves cooking and wants to die doing it.  Ummm, I love cooking too, but I certainly would not be working myself into a grave were I in this situation, I love other things more. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR Sous chef is dying from complications from diabetes, refuses medical help, is literally going to cut away parts of his own foot, and wants me to hold his job for him until he recovers.  I think firing him is for his own good, the owner says I shouldnâ€™t, am I the asshole?",

Im not really good friends with her but we get along.\n\nRecently T has been talking to a different girl (A)  since he is no longer interested in staying with M. For the most part M is cool but she can get really dramatic and aggressive over the smallest things, and my friend has lost all romantic feelings for her. T has told me that he's only with her at this point for the sex.\n\nNow he's been getting serious with A (going to her house, kissing, I don't think they've fucked tho) but he still hasn't broken up with M. I've been clear with him that at this point its hardcore cheating and he should just end things with M to avoid any serious repercussions. He says that he'll do it but he has pussied out many times.\n\nJust now M texted me and asked me to keep something between us. I think it would have been better if I stayed out of it completely but stupidly I said yes. She then told me about how she thinks he's cheating on her because she saw some messages on his phone coming from A. I played dumb and said she was overthinking things, and that A was just a friend.\n\nShe explicitly told me not to share any of it with T, but honestly he's my one of my best friends. I may not agree with his decisions but I'll back him up no matter what. The way I see it, my loyalty ultimately lies with him and not M. So of course I sent him screenshots of the convo to basically say \"hey, she knows. Time to end it man.\"\n\nWell he ended up calling her, and he mentioned some things that were in the screenshots that I sent, so she figured out that I ended up telling him. She confronted me about it but I denied everything and left it at that.\n\nSo in conclusion, was I wrong to lie to her and break her trust? She must feel like shit after what I did, and I don't blame her. Was there a better way to cover for T?",

Two, while I cannot confirm I believe the staff makes about the same as me (2k) despite having less responsibilities. Three, there are five of them and two of us. Therefore to get them each something of value we will likely have to pay a pretty penny. Four, I have a buttload of student debt.

Two friends of friends flew in before me and rented a car so they could go to the hotel first. I was picked up by my local friends and we had a great weekend in the city. On the day of departure, my local friends recommended I just ride with Jane and Kevin (the two aforementioned friends of friends) since they were on the way to the airport too. I agreed since it made sense for my local friends to go directly home and not waste time dropping me off if Jane and Kevin were going to the airport already. \nA few days later, I Venmo requested Jane and Kevin -and everyone else on the trip- food charges that we had eaten and split among the group. Kevin declined my request without any communication and sent back a request for gas. Now at this point I was a little confused since I had spoken to Jane (the one who had rented the car) and she had said gas wasn't an issue. The tank was only half empty when it was filled so with gas prices being around 3.50, I figured 20 bucks was the max that gas could cost - split among 3 would make it a little over 6 dollars. After declining my charge for food which was about 6 bucks, Kevin charged me an additional money for gas. I immediately declined the charge. Now several individuals who have been roped into this debacle are asking why I declined. Am I the asshole here? Is he? Both? Or is it just some miscommunication?",

I dont know if there was some factor that im completely misreading here but I'd love some input from an adult who could come at it from a more mature outlook. x",

Transparency at its finest. \n\nHowever, last night a friend texted me as we were watching Netflix and she asked if she could see the conversation, she was just curious, but I neither wanted to reply, nor I wanted to pause the show for a session of gossip and nosing around, so I refused to give her my phone. After that she just turned around and basically never talked to me all evening. \n\nMost of the times I don't mind if she asks me to have a look at my phone and read the conversations I have with my friends, she knows I don't like her doing so without my permission, but if she asks it's okay.\n\nHowever, I feel I have the right to just say no, without the need to explain myself, if I don't want her to invade my privacy and snoop around in my private conversations. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

            "input": "I love my fiancÃ© to death, but this has been a constant pout of contention between the two of us for quite some time. She brings up the idea that places are haunted or that astrology has any actual bearing on our actual lives and most of the time Iâ€™m willing to just smile and nod and let her go on thinking whatever she wants about that kind of stuff, but it actually makes me really angry when she tries to explain real life circumstances using astrology for example \n\nX canâ€™t get along with Y because heâ€™s a whatever sign and heâ€™s a whatever sign and so that means they are incompatible \n\nI think this is the biggest load of bullshit and extremely counterproductive to people actually understanding each other. Rather than fabricating a reason why they canâ€™t get along why not try to find common ground and common understanding. Wouldnâ€™t that be 10x better than ascribing some special meaning to the way the stars and planets align on any given night? \n\nAnother example of my supposed close mindedness is my refusal to believe in ghosts. Iâ€™m an avid horror movie enthusiast and love a good possession story but I know itâ€™s all fake! When you die you get pumped full of chemicals and buried in a guilted box or you get cremated and have your ashes spread and you are gone. That may be an uncomfortable concept to some but gone is gone. My fiancÃ© claims her friend Beverly who passed away when she was young is still around and looking out for her, while I would never ever ever attack this belief as she is and always has been very sensitive about the matter but she believes my refusal to acknowledge the existence of spirits is a direct insult to her friends memory. \n\nAll of this was brought to a head the other day resulting in a brief fight followed by a long awkward car ride. It all started with a conversation about ouija boards. She said she would be upset if I ever brought one into the house, given her beliefs I understand that but i think itâ€™s genuinely silly to be scared of an inanimate object. The fact that this specific object is seen as a bridge of sorts doesnâ€™t really change my view of it. Come on itâ€™s a freakin board with letters and numbers. Sure itâ€™s a fun party game but thereâ€™s always some asshole guiding the selector thing. Following me saying this we discussed both of the aforementioned situations and this resulted in her telling me I was being closed minded and inconsiderate of what she believes. I said itâ€™s healthy to be skeptical of things that are seemingly incorrect. (this may have been where I fucked up) \n\nWas I so quick to dismiss her beliefs that I hurt her feelings over it? Is she being overly sensitive? I honestly feel like itâ€™s a really stupid thing to fight over because the answer is so fucking obvious but I guess if you are brought up believing in that kind of stuff then it might be hard to shake later in life. AITA reddit?\n\n",

            "input": "Hey all.\n\nA week ago, my girlfriend and I hung out with two of her girl friends. We are all sixteen. \n\nWe spent the whole day together, playing mario kart, getting food, having a good time. I had to go home at midnight. but my girlfriend was talking about how her friend, (letâ€™s call him D, for douchebag) was going to sneak into her house at 1. When she first talked about it, my whole mood changed.\n\nI trust my girlfriend with everything, but I do not trust D. Sure, we are all mutual friends, in fact, D is quite fond of me. The thing is, a month prior, me, D, my girlfriend, and two other friends were hanging out, and I repeatedly saw D staring at my girlfriends caboose. I told her about this, and she started defending him. She did the whole, â€œIâ€™m not saying youâ€™re wrong, but are you sure you really saw what you think you did?â€? Yeah, didnâ€™t feel too good. \n\nA week prior to this, I had told her how her sneaking him into her house made me feel super uncomfortable. My argument was if she canâ€™t sneak me into her house, she shouldnâ€™t sneak another dude. She didnâ€™t really fully listen to my argument, because she said â€œItâ€™s just what WE DO, itâ€™s what our friend group has always done!â€?\n\nSo, Saturday night comes around and they sneak D in. He brought a dab pen and a Juul. They hang out, and he left at 5. On the drive home, I damn near had a mental breakdown. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and knowing that D having a dab pen with my girlfriend and being a horn-dog was a recipe for disaster. Was the thought of that kid fucking around with my girlfriend plausible? Possibly. Was it my anxieties getting the best of me? Most likely, but regardless, I shouldnâ€™t be put in that situation anyways.\n\nSunday morning comes around, and she could tell something was wrong because I didnâ€™t talk to her once I got home, I just gave her a â€œgoodnightâ€? which I never do. \n\nI tell her the way she made me feel was the worst I had ever felt. The sole fact that she would sneak a dude that isnâ€™t me into her house made me uncomfortable as it is, let alone\n\n1. He had weed with him (he had her hit the dab pen, this makes me mad at him, not her, in this case).\n2. If they got caught, she wouldnâ€™t be able to hang out with me at least until 2019\n3. Heâ€™s a horn dog who I have seen staring at her ass\n4. If I ever snuck a girl with weed into my house, she would have a goddamn epiphany\n\nShe started by trying to defend D, saying â€œOh itâ€™s just what we do, and D is a very good friend of mine.â€?\n\nI kept detailing how shitty it made me feel, and she realized she fucked up. She began crying and profusely apologizing. She said she was sick with herself. I told her I didnâ€™t mean to make her feel that way, but I was not okay with what she did and I needed to tell her. She cried more, and got off of her phone. We FaceTime later and talk about it for 4 hours. It was less of an argument, and more of a debate, because while this pissed me off monumentally I am pretty good at not starting an â€œargumentâ€?. \n\nShe eventually admits that she knows what she did was wrong, but she didnâ€™t at the time. She then goes on to tell me that she doesnâ€™t usually care what happens to her, and she always tries to put her friends first, because she hopes it will make her happier. I believe she may have been trying to guilt trip me? I donâ€™t know, but I said â€œIâ€™m sorry you feel that way, I really am, but the risk she took that night risked our entire relationship and that is not an okay risk to take. She keeps apologizing, and I keep saying that I accept her apology, but we will have a real problem if that happens again.\n\nSo here we are now. After many days of being angry with each other, we are back to normal and ready for Christmas. \n\nI still feel a little shaken up over it, and I never really got an apology for what she did, just for how it made me feel.\n\nIâ€™m not going to push her about it anymore unless it happens again. It was our first big argument, and I donâ€™t want that to happen again.\n\nTell me what you think.\n\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend sneaks a guy friend into her house in the dead of night against my wishes, I tell her how that made me feel, she starts self deprecating and making me feel bad, whilst also apologizing for the wrong thing, and we argue.

For the last few weeks everything has been going decently well but I just don't feel the same as I used to. \n\nWe were friends for a while before we started officially dating and we even helped eachother through past relationships. She is completely head over heels in love with me and I used to feel the same way but lately I guess the spark is just gone. I feel like our relationship has become a routine and honestly my feelings have become less romantic and more as those of a bestfriend. \nOur affectionate and sexual relationship also has gotten semi boring for me and honestly feels like the same pattern everytime enough to the point that I don't even want to bother anymore. \n\nMy girlfriend is also very close with my family so it may be awkward afterwards. She's been dumped before and everytime it's taken a dark toll on her. I feel like she's the closest thing to my perfect match that I'll ever find so I don't get why my brain is becoming indifferent towards her. \n\nI must add that I suffer from severe and chronic depression so I'm not sure if that may play a part. I know breaking up with her would tear her apart as we have a plethora of future plans and have even talked about marriage, adoption, and moving internationally.\n\nI don't want to break her heart or do anything I might regret but I have know clue how I can stay in a relationship with someone I now only love platonically.
