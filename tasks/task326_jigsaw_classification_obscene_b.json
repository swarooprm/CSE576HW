These are your 'sunnis' that you are protecting. Hillary has already admitted that we know KSA and Qatar fund ISIS in the region.  You support these sunnis, but in Syira, and Iran anyone is free to practice their religion.  How many churches are in KSA? Thats right, 0\n4) Most importantly, the overwhemingly majority of Syria supports Assad.  Most of Assads army is made of sunnis.  So the rebels are jihadis",

That sound about right?\n\nBullshit. If they want APD service they can pay the tax like the rest of the Muni. Otherwise they can call the Troopers and wait 3 days like they do in the bush. And as for patrolling the Seward Highway, it's a state owned road. Let them patrol it. If they have a problem with that, they can turn over the Glenn and Seward highways to the Muni and we will put a damn toll booth at either end of the Muni to fund patrols and maintenance. That ought to really piss off the folks who live outside of Anchorage and don't contribute a dime to the services they use and rely every day when they commute in.\n\nNow where did I put my asbestos suit?",

Just a few months ago, fans were proclaiming  (some still are) \"journeyman\", \"backup at best\", \"average ceiling - maybe\", \"Trevor Orton\" and many more less complimentary names and insults. Through all that, a few of us were defending TS, saying \"it's too early for those labels\" and very few were saying \"pump the brakes\" then.\n\nSo, now that there's more data and the bandwagon is getting dangerously top heavy, nobody really cares (or wants) a safe ride with brakes pumped at every turn, especially when you'er 2-0 on the first 2 turns. Fans want the thrill of being 1st to cross the finish line, with every heart stopping moment and every breath taking spectacle that makes them cling to their seats and squeal for more along the way. That's football, that's entertainment and that's what fans love.\n\nSo damn the brakes, full speed ahead! GO BRONCOS!",

However, may I relate a short, personal and I think, relevant story.  \n\nI've always been a politically active person.  That didn't set well with a local School District where I was employed.  They found a way to use a \"reduction in force\" to end my employment.  Like Mr. Johnson,  I felt I had been \"royally screwed\" and was extremely bitter.  Fortunately, I was able to \"get over it\" and keep that bitterness from clouding my future.  It wasn't real easy,   I still think the administrators and Board members were a bunch of #@$%$s, but they are $#$%^s \"in the past.\"  I've \"gotten even\" by enjoying the last 30 plus years and, while I've been \"at it\", outliving all of them.\n\n  It sounds like Aaron is doing the same.  \n\nThis will sound a little \"preachy\", but, IMO,  how we handle \"getting screwed\" is more important than \"getting screwed\"  regards and best wishes,   Gary",

I know you've been around long enough to have heard it before, it was the battle cry for starting Tebow when Studesville  took over as the interim coach following McDope's firing. Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point.

Those leaders also perceived (again, likely very correctly) that, with the election fo Abraham Lincoln and the ever-growing power of the Abolitionist movement, slavery in the U.S. was coming to an end....and likely in the near future.  Rather than seek to negotiate as favorable a transition as possible, likely including compensation for emancipated slaves, the South chose to secede.  It's no surprise that most the young men in the South chose to support secession. They were raised in the South and slavery was part of the values system of their lives.  ....and, yes, those damn Yankees were going to end slavery.  Gary Crum",

Unlike the CIA I don't interfere in foreign countries domestic affairs but here is my advise to the people of UK:\n\n1) UK wanting to exit the EU is similar to Ukraine wanting to *join* the EU. Exit/join it does not matter. It will be so messy the result is worse. So prepare for collapse. \n\n2) Scotland don't want Brexit. Indeed it is ready to exit if Brexit happen. Well, Scotland can do a referendum and simply exit the UK. If Crimea, an autonomous state of Ukraine, has the guts to do it surely the brave Scots can. Don't worry about American propaganda - such a referendum is legal. \n\n3) Now that Scotland exited, what's next? Join EU? Ain't going going to happen. Spain and others will veto. I do suggest Scotland join Russia, just like Crimea. Russia will protect it well. And yes, don't worry about the nonsense hoopla about being 'annexed' by Russia.

Both make sense.\n\nRe KM1's comments, a start would be to set the bar at higher surtaxes/property taxes for purchases made with \"non-Canadian-taxed\" income.  This is doable if the provinces and feds cooperate to make all RE transactions contingent on a thorough review of income tax filings of the purchaser. That's the only way to know if Canadian income tax has been fully paid on all the money being used for the purchase. Money from outside Canada would only be suitable if it was duly taxed in a country that has a fair tax agreement with Canada. \"Gift\" money would only be suitable if one could show the source, and that source's income tax filings revealed tax duly paid in Canada or in a country with a fair tax agreement with Canada.  No sale if taxes paid aren't commensurate with the RE purchase price.",

Also, one can see the roots of the current situation in decisions made at that time. Trump is a natural culmination of many Republican racial policies; he is different because he said openly what the Republicans had been saying with dog whistles since Nixon introduced the Southern strategy. The Trump situation also seems to be a very deliberate effort to roll back many of the gains made by minorities over the past 40 years. One way in which Trump is absolutely unique is that he has put forward a foreign policy that undermines most of the post-WWII consensus in US politics. Whether or not he will act on this remains to be seen,  but his anti-free trade, leadership by extortion message is a marked departure and has many American allies reconsidering their reliance on the US.",

So now my guests are buying bear spray practicing and taking precautions in bear country. Treadwell was attacked first as he left the tent to confort a bear. A 7 minute live voice tape was left on his video camera so they know what happened.

I recently had to go to the Fasi Building and parked in the underground structure where all parking is metered.  The meters take cards, so I stuck my card in but for whatever reason, it was denying the card.  It might have been just that meter, but parking was tight that day, and I couldn't just move stalls.  I had no coins on me.  Thankfully, another person was coming to his car, so I asked if he had coins to trade for bills and luckily, he did.  Funny thing was, I went to the security office close by, and they don't give change.  Their suggestion was to go into the building where they have a convenience store, purchase something (after waiting in line for ID check, then waiting in line again to exit), then get change....assuming that no one will come by to ticket my car for an expired meter in the mean time.  Lesson learned:  carry 8-12 quarters in the car at all times!",

Because black lives mattered.Not because they had to bare the burden of redeeming every racist white person involved with hate based crimes. They instead acknowledged the color of their skin afforded them a level of privilege and treatment not afforded to the black communities. They utilized their privledge and worked together with Black leaders to establish the NAACP and their message of equal rights.

This Midwestern populism looks suspiciously on over-involvement in foreign affairs, & is less concerned with the size of government, preferring that it be effective & fair. Someone like Rob Portman embodies some of this. I still say Trump has killed Ryanism & the deep entitlement cuts Ryan has championed. And while I largely agree w/ Gerson & others like David Frum, don't forget that they  shoulder some blame as the architects & voices of a failed Iraq War that totally discredited \"Compassionate Conservatism\" & created a void for Trump.   The issue for the GOP is whether Trump is an \"empty vessel\" into which various factions compete to fill in, or whether he genuinely believes in some of what he has said.

I found the comments funny since almost anyone working in the justice system is college educated.",

In other words they prefer a more fiscally conservative approach to government spending. \nTo obscure the fact, to obfuscate, that most Alaskans support the house budget proposal is a delusion, his delusion.\nIf what Crawford says is true, why is it Alaskans that make up the Mat-Su Borough are considering enacting a broad based sales tax to fund the rising cost of education? Why do Alaskans in the Kenat Peninsula Borough use a broad based sales tax? This is certainly not most, or majority of Alaskans.

That's what the plaintiffs' suit is all about--to get an objective determination of the amount from the court, since in the plaintiffs' view the State has been low-balling the figure. While it is true that the problem should have been corrected without litigation, by agreeing to settle the case, the State was implicitly admitting that it would lose if it forced the plaintiffs to go to trial. Since Rep. Luke has rejected the settlement to which the State agreed, she has forced the court to decide the issue, and the cost (including the attorneys fees that the State will be obligated to pay in full if it loses at trial, which is likely) will very likely be substantially higher than the figure set forth in the settlement.

Does your child have scripted curricula in math and English? I've worked in two of the biggest complexes and the CASs in both expected teachers to use the workbooks page by page without deviating.

There is a dedicated bike lane for these individuals but they feel the need to use the sidewalk instead.

So elected officials, I've complained to you and you do nothing.

So when we get to 40 or so members, we break off a group and start again with a core of ten or fifteen.\n\nThat means we're always getting inquiries from potential new members, who often come to us with questions about their churches. As you can imagine, one of the questions we hear frequently is about the church's position on divorce and remarriage. We make every effort to not exploit the church's situation in order to get new members, but therein lies the problem: we don't know what to say is the church's position at the moment, and AL is not as helpful as we'd like. Since we don't want to exploit folks, we have to send them back to clergy we know will help them, but what happens after that?",

Some of the \"best\" pitchers gain a mechanical advantage by leaving the ground before releasing the ball and are simply allowed to do it. Other pitchers get called for it, which awards a base to the batter and all runners. White, having been an elite pitcher, can spot pitchers who leave the ground and often asks the umps to call it. Opposing coaches probably hate him for it. The fact is, the rule exists for a reason, but it is enforced rarely and unevenly, which is bad for the game. White makes a good point.",

Another reason is when you have a kid from a poor family that had the opportunity to go to a private school like Kamehameha, Punahou, or Iolani, it's a big thing because there are more college opportunities to folks that go to these schools versus some public schools and if they work hard, some of them can actually pull their families out of poverty into the middle class or better if they end up with a good job.",

Francis is starting with trying to get bishops to really to be courageous in speaking what their experience tells them and seeing what the Church needs for today, for the state of the faith in the world as it is.

As a result if you want free markets you tend to need privatization.\n\nHowever a \"natural monopoly\" is a case where competition really isn't feasible at this time from a purely technological standpoint.  There is just no way for a company to come in and compete with HydroOne, whether they are public or private, even if there were no laws preventing that.\n\nAs a result HydroOne is doing nothing to create a free market, it just changes a public monopoly for a private monopoly.",

Electric motors usually generate much more torque at 0 speed than an ICE which requires high rpms to produce sufficient power to overcome its own piston compression requirements (remember each piston is only producing power about 25% of the time, and that power stroke needs to power the remaining compression, injection and exhaust strokes) ergo an ICE engine tends to hit its peak torque towards its mid level revs and then needs a gearbox to convert those ~3000rpms into  1 rpm at the wheel. (Diesels tend to have a torque curve that continues to rise with rpms)  Whereas an electric motor generates instant torque at starting thus no need to reduce rpms to wheels, and the rotating magnetic field eventually brakes the amount of current into the stator magnets thus reducing the torque once the rotor is turning. But ultimately the stall torque load of most electric motors is still higher than peak torque in an ICE.",

So no harm done.\n\nPeople who care about rights and freedoms should look carefully at each proposed use of s.33. I'd recommend they judge each specific instance on the basis of whether invoking it clearly does more good than harm. Invoking s.33 to deny people their rights would be a grave abuse in my opinion.

This was very refreshing because is all we hear is Treason, Impeachment, Russian Collusion, Treason,Impeachment, Russian Collusion. It is nice to know there is someone sane out there. Donald Trump Jr. did not break any laws. The Russian woman really wanted to discuss sanctions which would have been illegal. She was close to the Dem campaigns, attended Dem political rallies, and sat in with up front seats on Congressional hearings, so the most reasonable conclusion has to be that she was trying to set the Trump campaign up but they didn't take the bait, so the overzealous Democrats thought it was worth a spin to try to get impeachment out of it. They are desperate.  Pray for your President. The Rinos are no help, they are his enemies same as the Democrats. He is alone in the Swamp, but so far God has kept his feet from slipping.",

It allows them to pay wages BELOW the minimum wage by counting an employees tips to satisfy the employer's obligation to pay the minimum wage. The employers often choose to employ workers less than the minimum hours to qualify for benefits and as parttime workers, they need the tips to get by. The reality is that workers who work lunch shifts or breakfast shifts do not get the high tip income. The reality is that nearly ALL these workers are not unionized and are subject to the employer's arbitrary assignment of hours...and number of hours...Most are also expected to share their tips with busboys, etc. . The reality is that employer violations of wage and hour laws in the resturant industry is among the highest of any industry in Oregon. That SOME fancier resturants have SOME waiters or waitresses in Portland  may  earn a higher wage hides the reality that MOST do not, especially outside of Portland's trendier spots.",

However, from what I`ve read, that accounts for fewer than 10% of all prescriptions in the case of statins in general and with the growing expertise in genetics, it should be possible more than ever to identify those with the best chance of benefitting and those who will see no benefit and may see harm from taking them.\n\nIn the case I know best, the ACE inhibitor (Ramipril) was invaluable.   Zocor and Lipitor (statins) caused a lot of grief (lots of unpleasant side effects) and the patient eventually got the cardiologist to agree to drop the statin.   Based on tests done later, it was clear the statin had likely been of negligible, if any, value, and the ACE inhibitor plus very low dose blood thinner had been doing the heavy lifting.   In the end, what started as a five drug regime was reduce to two.   It made a big difference for the patient and their ability to live life pleasantly and also represented a significant difference in cost.",
