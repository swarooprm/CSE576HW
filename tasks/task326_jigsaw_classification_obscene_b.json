He posits this as though it occurred in an historical vacuum, which it did not. Reaction against the consistent ethic of life occurred against the backdrop of attempts by the Catholic left to respond to Roe, & resulted in an attempt to co-opt elements of Catholic social teaching for alignment with another political party. I have no disagreement with what you, Cupich or Francis, says about the primacy of abortion, the need for respect, etc. Instead, I am only trying to assert a one-sided narrative that I think Winters engages in here.

At the same time, we must consider that the culture of that place and time was far different than today. God transcends culture because the Gospel is based on the principles of God's love, not human interpretation of them.

They should not get full benefit after 35 years to the CPP portion of their pension, while others have to contribute 40 years for the same benefit.

This kind of feigning that one doesn't know one's own language never ends.  The demands never end.  A slight will be found someplace else.  And given the origin of these feigned slights and this pressure campaign, not out of Christianity itself but out of a worldly and often atheistic and hostile ideology they should be nonstarters.

Then the RTD shut the bus down in preparation for forcing us all onto the \"A\" train. To use the \"A\" train I need to get myself three miles to a light rail station. There is a bus a few blocks away I can catch if I lug my bags over there. Hopefully not in the rain or snow. Then I take the light rail downtown, where I get to drag my bags half a mile to the \"A\" train. Which may or may not be running, depending on what breaks down that day. To be sure I get to the airport on time I need to leave my house at least four hours before flight time. Thanks, but no thanks. Bring back the SkyRide buses!",

Under current law, if your parent dies and leaves you the long time family home  and you sell it, your basis in the home is the value of it on the day they died, rather than what they bought it for.  This means that you will not show a gain from the sale and will have no taxable income from it. If Trump sticks to his plan to get rid of the ability to step up the basis, then when you sell the home that your parents bought a couple decades ago, you will likely show a significant taxable gain. Of course, Trump has also talked about getting rid of the capital gains tax at every income level, so in that case no one pays anything... This is something to watch as they reshape the tax code, as for many the only real asset they have is their home and it could be a downward shift in taxes.",

The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\". Good shepherds would not leave their flocks vulnerable to predators.\n \"Lies; lies and damn lies\" . \nYour synopsis is very revealing and opens up another path to understanding this critical failure by the institutional church. Thank you Kieran.",

Also, to prevent this kind of thing in the future, it would seem that the release protocol should be reviewed as well as the jail design.  Looks like the officers must actually open the door to interact with the inmate while an opening in the door to allow handcuffing prior to opening the door might be useful.  Also, the protocol could include a mandate of a duo of officers present any time the door is opened.  It states in the story that this dude was disruptive throughout his incarceration and yet no special precaution was taken.  The inmate, especially when mentally ill, should not automatically be blamed for deficient incarceration protocols.",

I would rather have Bernier leading the Cons and I see nothing compelling in any of the NDP's leadership aspirants. But governments tend to defeat themselves in this country. Trudeau's only accomplishments to date, like sort of getting along with Trump and a relatively robust but still fragile economy, have been achieved by default. But big minefields exist for the Libs on immigration, NAFTA and aboriginal affairs. On the latter issue, I suspect most Canadians have little interest in the models of aboriginal sovereignty proposed by many First Nations advocates. It will be almost impossible for Trudeau to achieve his vaunted new relationship with First Nations and keep the remaining 96% of Canadians mollified. And his broader predilection for identity pandering increasingly irritates many Canadians. The risks ahead are all Trudeau's to face.",

Pence who said the magic word for the evangelical voter: \"sanctity of life\" and \"pro-life.\"  Frankly, I don't care about an elected official's moral dilemma as what matters is how they govern.  How and where they worship (or not) is of little importance in this matter.  My general conclusions about the VP debate is that it matters none, no one changed their vote as a result, the undecided will remain undecided until they are in the voting booth, and the divisions were set long ago.  Barring any catastrophic events, and I am not certain there won't be one of some  sort, what will happen in a month from now is pretty well established.

The ACA and Obama promised coverage for millions more people while reducing price. They then proceeded to require all plans to include coverage for more conditions.

Clearly, the doctors were going to be on the losing end of this bargain as insurance companies were required to cover more people for more things for less money, and we all know how willing insurance companies are to operate at a loss. The result has been insurance companies dropping out of the ACA market, leaving some areas with as few as one provider (i.e. a monopoly), and doctors dropping out of the market because of low reimbursement rates.\n\nDo we get it now?\n\nIt is time to repeal and replace this mess caused by Obama and the Democrats.

There are credible assessments that more than 25% of BC's GDP is currently generated by the residential building boom which, in turn, depends upon the stimulus of the urban residential property bubble.  This bubble doesn't extend into the northern communities to any significant extent and, in any case, is arguably not sustainable.  It follows that the north does not participate in the reported economic growth of BC.\n\n2. The north is languishing and this highlights for residents there the hollowness of the BC Liberal promise of LNG development induced prosperity.\n\n3. The political question will be therefore whether northerners turn to the NDP because of BC Liberal failures or, conversely, they turn to the Liberals because the NDP is viewed as putting job growth at risk because of their emphasis on environment protection.\n\nPolling currently suggests that the Liberals are the preferred if reluctant choice of northerners but this could change.",

Suddenly he had a roster full of superstars and not enough money to pay them all with the new cap. The team slowly fell apart and conveniently Lacroix retires so that his \"genius\" reputation as a GM stayed in tact.  Since then the Avs haven't found a good GM who knows how to manage the cap well and keep good young talent in Colorado, or good coaches for that matter.

This was unnerving, and gave the impression that some people were on the edge of becoming completely unhinged. As much as I thought Professor Shurtz's act displayed a huge lapse in judgment, I was far more disturbed by the ferocity of the anti-Shurtz camp. People everywhere were modeling the very intolerance and disrespect they hated.

Most of the so called outbreaks end up with less than 50 people contacting measles or chicken pox and other than missing a week of school, very little other consequences.

Turns out the security guard was an FBI informant. Informants do what their handlers tell them. He was involved in ratting out the Fairbanks milita and now lives in witness protection program.  Murk's dirty tricks will catch up with her.  She is a RINO, does not support conservative issues and is a strong supporter of full funding for Planned Parenthood.   Vote Miller!",

My main points are that we should not be privatizing a public resource, much less giving it away, and that it not should become property that can be converted into capital.\n\nWith any limited resource, we need a fair way to distribute it, and permits are certainly a legitimate tool. I have a subsistence halibut permit - a permit type which is actually overly-generous and prone to abuse, I fear - but I can't pass it on, sell it, or even give it away. It doesn't cost anything and expires every two years. Fine.\n\nWhy don't we give perpetual, salable guiding rights to big game guides in wildlife refuges? Or perpetual, salable national forest cutting rights to timber companies? Or perpetual, salable vending rights to companies in national parks?  Absurd, right?\n\nBut when it comes to commercial fish, we've been sold the bill of goods that we have to give them away in order to manage them. Even more absurd. And, to me, criminal.",

I'd not ask it to reject Jesus, should society ever go through such a phase.  But at the same time, so many of the church's positions have rather clearly been categorically rejected by the laity, that the church's ongoing formal position becomes a matter of obstinacy.  Such a situation needs to be met head on: a dialog of sorts between church leaders and the people they serve.  If such a dialog cannot lead to an agreement, then I think the laity should prevail.\n\nAs to the definition of abuse/evil, I think you're missing a bit one (inferred, but not stated).\n\nWhen the organization finds itself selling out individuals (ESPECIALLY the weak/vulnerable) so as to protect others, alarm bells should ring.\n\nThanks for the post: well done.",

To be \"progressive\" means that one thinks the state should have authority over every aspect of a society's culture and over every aspect of the individual's life.  Also, Progressivism is de facto socialist. Progressives also promote the so-called pro-choice position respecting abortion. These same support gay marriage,  and take other positions of morality inimical to the Catholic Faith. \n\nBut for lack of space in which to write, I could mention other ways that Progressivism is contrary to the faith.

So if we want a grower on our card, which used to be free, we now have to pay $50.  We used to also be able to deduct what we spent on meds each month for our benefits.  Like it wasn't dollar for dollar but it helped.  What we'd spend on medicine would increase our food stamps.  Now?  Nope.  \n\nWe can't find growers because they make more $$ selling to the shops.  \n\nWe have no idea if pesticides were used.  For the same amount of meds for $90. is now costing around $250=300.   There should be a co.op to get patients 'at cost' meds like a number of years ago.  Growing helps yes but if you're crippled, it's a mute point.  l2g",

We are in the Imago Dei ... whether biologically male or female or intersex, whether straight or gay or any shade in between.\n\nAnd the higher good is the flourishing both of individual humans and of the collective. Love is the higher good. Loving gay couples do not need to be limited by a proscriptive neoscholastic frame of reference.",

It was not until 1967 (!) that the Court affirmed this right for interracial couples. \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"",

Is there any depth to them?\n\nWhat is ironic, too, is Weinandy complaining about the Pope refusing to dialogue with him and talk to him when that is exactly what he did in his \"judging\" other theologians, like Eliz.

It's a egregious constitutional violation which, essentially, deprives citizens of the initiative right.  The initiative process was designed and placed in the US and Oregon Constitutions specifically to provide citizens a direct \"recourse for grievances\" vis a vis an over-reaching and controlling legislative body.  The Board's assumption of a preemptive veto power to keep initiatives off the ballot negates that constitutionally protected citizens' power.  IMO, a Board truly dedicated to democracy would not even want such power, let alone try to grant it to themselves.  regards, Gary",

Almost 100 people are employed.  5 employees might actually be eligible for a PFD.  The rest are from out of state. Again the state is paying 65%.  If the oil rig hits oil, the state will get back 12.5% royalty and zero production tax after paying full cost to lift and transport.   Pay 65% up front, get back 12.5% on the back end.  If the rig hits gas, the state will get 17 cents per mbu.  Enstar just signed a five year contract to pay $7.52 per mbu.  On the North Slope, the state taxes on the net profit and rebates those taxes as a percentage of the gross price.  This virtually ensures that the remaining 3.5 billion barrels of easy lift oil will be sold for next to nothing in production taxes.  \"Asinine\"!",

PM Trudeau should end our training mission in Ukraine. Whatever justification for it there may have been before obviously no longer exists given the reckless behaviour of Ukraine’s ruling kleptocrat. Defence Minister Sajjan’s sabre-rattling against Russia was grossly irresponsible when a tough love approach to the Ukrainian government was surely what was called for. Russia is hardly blameless in this conflict, but was not responsible for this flare-up. Like most of Trudeau’s cabinet picks, Sajjan is not living up to his advance billing.",

That starts right at the top of the pile & trickles all the way down to the local level. Case in hand would be the crooked officials that collect per diem when they live in Juneau or when they state that they're in session but are not at all. Another case is the one state official that charged the state about $18,000 to pay for moving some items of his to his home  when not entitled. The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all. Another wasteful practice is when the state employees use like UPS or FedEx to ship an item to another office right within the city be it Anchorage or Fairbanks. Why can't you just get off your fat lazy butt & take the time to deliver it to the office rather then use an unnecessary service. Waste!",

They tried to get him to leave the plane but he refused and was becoming even more resistant and agitated. If that's all they told the police, then the police would assume that it was a public safety issue and would certainly feel justified in doing whatever it took to remove the man and use force since he was not likely to calm down.

A time when America's children were taught that building a demonstrably better Mouse Trap led success to your door.  \n\nA time very different from today when we daily see innovative companies producing even the most efficient, economical effective Mouse Traps run out of business by government-subsidized companies producing less efficient, uneconomical (w/o taxpayers taxed extra to pay others to buy them), unwanted Mouse Traps.\n\nA time when taxpayers working two jobs are taxed extra to pay for subsidies that allow those earning more to buy novel experiments sold below cost.\n\nSeems wrong.

The need then is to examine whether the supply being built meets shelter demand (would require legislation/ incentives to drive building of units with more bedrooms), as well as to assess whether this \"demand\" is being driven by demand for something other than demand for shelter (which has a lot less to do with population growth than it does with speculation [either foreign or domestic]).\n\nIt's worth noting that the population growth rate in the Lower Mainland was larger 10-20 years ago, when prices were relatively flat. And that rents here, even with recent increases, are less than the carrying costs for owning (very true for detached houses). This does not suggest demand for shelter.",

I also remember the City officials intentionally awarding contracts to start the project before receiving Federal government approval and when they got caught and had to stop the work, they claimed the contracts were awarded prematurely to convince the public that the rail project was progressing as planned. Look where we are now – a 20-mile route, half completed for $8 billion and several billion more needed to get it to Ala Moana Center.  Despite this, no one has been held accountable.  Instead of more money to complete the rail project, we need a Federal investigation under RICO statutes for the rampant corruption called HART.   Lock them up.",

Seems to me that decision was made by the Trump administration.  What does $3 million mean to Green?  \n\nI think if no action has been taken yet to hold Green/Hobby Lobby criminally liable, then none will be taken.  Maybe, but probably not.  How is a corporation held criminally liable since the corporation can't be sent to jail?  More fines that aren't anything but a cost of doing business?\n\nI still think this stinks.

If you look at indissolubility as an absolute independent of such examples, you risk violating the greatest of the commandments, the source of \"all the law and the prophets.\"  Francis is simply pointing out that in cases like the examples in FC 84 discernment -- where the person seeks submission to the Spirit of Christ -- is necessary to assure that the greatest of the commandments is followed.  The role of the pastor is not permission.  In the end, the person must answer to God, who is written on the human heart.",

Or maybe you're going to try to keep up the relatively boring nutritional plan, three days/wk of weights and three days/wk of running. Either way, I wish you luck. Please, please, please -- in the upcoming three years, write at least a yearly follow-up article. Anyone with sufficient will-power can hang in for six months -- that's not the test. It's what happens after that initial period of will power has been frittered away by a million day-to-day factors that tells the story.

Definitely remote. I did not see any homes or other buildings around the check point and wondered where the border control agents lived.  Norton’s population was 169 in 2010.  The nearest “large” town is Island Pond, 16 miles south.  Its population was 821 in 2010, but it does have a few shops that serves people living in the surrounding wilderness.  It is a beautiful area, hilly and wooded with many streams and lakes.   Great place for hunting and fishing.  Summers are short and cool summers; winters are long, cold and miserable.   My wife and I wondered why anyone would want to work there except perhaps hard-core locals.  Customs and Border Protection apparently is wondering the same thing.",

How's that for \"Optics\"?\n\nMan it's almost like Dan Inouye's deja vu ,where you couldn't wait for him to retire. Unlike Dan Inouye,the longer McCain stays in office the more damage he can do. It's almost like he has  this contempt (personal Vendetta) for Pres. Trump. So whatever Trump does, he will oppose it! And how's that serving the people?\nIMUA!",

Saying things like \"Climate change is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced\" is pure propaganda and outright false.  I know (not think) that capitalism and economics will transform society in 200 years more than CO2 emissions will transform the environment in 200 years.  We can be reasonably certain of that based upon history and science alone, barring some cataclysmic event such as a Yellowstone eruption or nuclear war or asteroid impact.\n\nWhat is often ignored in the climate change debate are the costs of government policies, particularly opportunity costs, and only a vague declaration of the possible benefits (without evidence).

That was proven when, after a few day, Comey closed the investigation again. All he ever had was some reason, which has never been disclosed, to have a look at a laptop computer belonging to the Clinton campaign. He could have done so quietly, and then revealed any pertinent evidence if it were discovered. Instead, he very publicly re-opened the investigation... and then closed it again when nothing turned up.

Either to attend the private school and agree to its principles, or not to attend. If I recall correctly the BC Court of Appeal affirmed that point. No one's forced to attend TWU, and there are many options available for those don't want to.\n\nWith respect to the 2001 SCC decision, it's not up to the SCC nor anyone else to decide what a student feels is a fair personal cost. A non-heterosexual student who, for reasons of her own, chooses not to be sexually active isn't inconvenienced by the covenant in the slightest. Hence, the matter is properly left up to the individual. You either agree to the covenant or you don't, and if you don't you go elsewhere.",

It was a tough life, but people came for religious and civil freedom and a new start, to get away from religious persecution and the aristocratic levels of society that restricted them from higher occupations.\n\nThis is not the case at all today. Many people from poorer countries would love to come to the more developed nations, not necessarily for religious and civil freedom, but for money and prosperity. And since there are welfare and medical systems in place, the cost of an immigrant to the nation is much higher than in the days of the Revolution. Because of these costs, unlimited, borderless, immigration would ruin the economy of any developed nation today.",

I think, for Cape Town's MyCiti anyway, the large cost was for totally new infrastructure - stations, dedicated lanes and, of course, brand new (Brazilian) buses with their touch-'n-go card pay systems. MyCiti is based on cities like Curitiba, except those examples could not easily be applied to SA's apartheid-era spatially inefficient, decentralised urban planning, which added to MyCiti's cost (long distances). \nThe selling point for these systems is they're 'rapid' - buses in dedicated lanes are not going to get stuck in traffic like other motorists, so people would want to use them, and it's cheaper than private car (fuel, wear & tear, long travelling times on congested roads).  Note other cities w/ functioning, efficient mass bus systems like London and Rome don't use dedicated lanes except here and there. So there's your billions, not overpriced tenders.\nBTW Cape Town has increased street 2017 parking rates by almost 60% to about R17/hr, above private rates!",

This (to me) is the most obvious error which religious devotees make - they already have \"god is the answer\" ... no matter what the question is. \n\nDiscoveries about the human brain (and don't forget all the other critters too) are coming fast and often. We will learn so much more about what really goes on during meditation as future years unfold. And we will learn (I believe) that animals have much greater capacities than we currently realize. \n\nFurther, I believe that the direction of humankind will greatly improve once more humans learn how their \"obvious answers\" are not really that clear. Many religions discourage this process - some more - some less. BTW, I think meditation can have value.",

Cause, you know, he was being a dick.\n\nOutraged by this, Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens, there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb, the day of the eclipse, he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse, he waited as the good people begged for their women and children. He agreed to 'bring the sun back', and essentially enslaved the people until he was rescued.\n\nWHAT A DICK.\n\nhappy leap year",

When the above sermon comes up year after year along with its self righteous comments, it does just that. Still, for Eli, being forgotten added to his constant misery of dealing with forgiveness.

The last premier to become a party leader was Bob Stanfield, 40 years ago.

What wasn't phony were my opinions, which in general I am proud of.  \n\nI still host martini parties for mixed crowds, though age has forced me to limit them to two on any given day.  There is nothing like a martini to get everyone in a room yakking away all at the same time, a happy scene indeed.  Also, jjp58 made a lot of money, but I don't (though I can't complain, life is good, so far!).  If you're going to invent someone, why not make her rich?\n\nI like the English language.

Perhaps in such cases even some sympathy can be understood, if not openly approved of, if actual misdeeds were committed against the betrayer.  Some say the1887 commemoration of Benedict Arnold's left foot or boot is an example of such sympathy.

Those holidays happen early enough in the school year that there is no way I wouldn't be able to make up the work, but since the teacher had scheduled a test for that day, with no way to make it up, I was out of luck as far as he was concerned.

Enlarging the reporting window might not have made much difference, but a reporter could have always gone to a job site or two for a quick comment or photo. And among other things it would be interesting to know how much money this is costing people (not that the tree services don't deserve the money), and what can be done other times of year to reduce the potential for damage in these storms.
