  "Definition": "You are given with two sentences. You have to find if there is entailment/agreement of the Hypothesis by the Premise. From the given pair of sentences, you should identify if there is enough information in the Premise to support the claim made in the Hypothesis. The Premise should not exactly be the same as Hypothesis. The output of this task is either 'entails' for premise supporting the hypothesis or 'neutral' for non-supporting premise",

  "Positive Examples": [
    {
      "input": "Premise: Lyme Disease is caused by a bacterium that's transmitted by tick bite, but many infected people don't remember a bite.Hypothesis: Lyme disease is caused by bacteria.",
      "output": "entails",
      "explanation": "The premise sentence agrees with the hypothesis that Lyme Disease is a bacterium. Premise also gives additional information about Lyme disease. Therefore Premise entails Hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "input": "Premise: Corolla Collective term for all the petals of a flower, these petals may be separate or fused together. Hypothesis: All of the petals together are called a corolla.",
      "output": "entails",
      "explanation": "The premise sentence explains the meaning of Corolla. Hypothesis sentence is explained by the Premise. Since the Premise supports/entails the Hypothesis, this is classified as entails."
    },
    {
      "input": "Premise: This can be dangerous to both plants and animals. Hypothesis: Nematodes can be a parasite of both.",
      "output": "neutral",
      "explanation": "The premise misses the context to the word 'this'. Therefore it is incomplete. The hypothesis is not supporting the premise. Therefore it is classified as neutral"
    },
    {
      "input": "Premise: The liver is divided into the right lobe and left lobes.Hypothesis: The gallbladder is near the right lobe of the liver.",
      "output": "neutral",
      "explanation": "The premise states about the general structure of the liver while the hypothesis is explaining about a specific part of the liver. Therefore this premise does not support the hypothesis and hence classified as neutral"

      "output": "entails",
      "explanation": "The premise does not have a fact that can be supported. It is a task that should be carried out to find the pH of the substances. The hypothesis is therefore not supported by the premise. It should be classified as neutral not as entails"

      "input": "Premise: The phylum for common marigolds is angiosperms.Hypothesis: Angiosperms are the most successful phylum of plants.",

      "input": "Premise: Vertebrates are named for vertebrae, the series of bones that make up the vertebral column or backbone. Hypothesis: Backbone is another name for the vertebral column.",
      "output": "neutral",
