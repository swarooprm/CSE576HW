Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me .      That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation .      I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited .      Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ?      I have a better idea .

I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn .      What do natives get ?      They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity .      Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ?      Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken .      I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities .      Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . ",

You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries .

I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .      Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .      You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?      I don't think it's broken .

Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it .      I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .      How do you mean \" suffer \" ?      I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .      Even in the winter ?      Yes , even in the winter .      And even if it takes two hours , huh ?      Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !      Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .      Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !      I know . I can see that . This is what is called \" dim sum , \" right ?      Yes , all these dishes are different \" dim sum \" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .      So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?      Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .      And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .      No way !      What do you mean ?      We're going up to the \" new \" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .      Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ?      No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the \" new \" Chinatown .      Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?      No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .      I wonder if you can cook things this good .      I'm a great cook actually .

I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .      That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .      What's to come next ?      If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing .      How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?

They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom .      Even silverware ?      Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient .      I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ?      I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store .      What does that mean ?      That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics .      Electronics ?      Yes . Like stereos and televisions .      How much is the membership fee ?      I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all      I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things .      I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . ",

Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ?      Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football .      It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ?      Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young .

People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .      Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .      How do you think they could be ended ?      I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that .      So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them .      It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .      Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .

Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country .

One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region .

I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ?      Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it .      All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?      Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .      I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .      Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?      Which country makes the best coffee in the world ?      Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .      I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?      Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .      No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .      I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . ",

We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless .      Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives .

Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !      Yeah , yeah , whatever . ",

Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you .      It's been a full two years since we last saw each other .      So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years .      We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .      I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .      Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .      Thank you .      But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .      That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?      500 pieces .      No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .      All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .      I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .      We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .      No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .      Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .      Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow .      Good , that's all then .      Good . ",

Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ?

I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .      That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .      What's to come next ?      If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing .      How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?

Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ?      Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production .

I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China .      Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country .      I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ?      Yes , you are right .

You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .      The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .      They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's \" chi \" .      But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?      The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .      Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .      This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .      Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .      This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .      Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . ",

If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .      I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?      One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !      When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?      You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .      What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?      One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .      So I need plenty of space for this exercise .      Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .      Great . Thanks for you advice ! ",

I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer .      Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ?      Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation .      If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ?      I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility .      Are you able to operate the telex ?      Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information .

Well , it was not like a normal English League match .      No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .      Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye .      Which team do you back then ?      I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .      But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . ",

I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology .      Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ?      Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service .      Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle .

I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction .      Interesting ...      Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . ",

I like the “ best actor and actress ” . ",

We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working !      not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black .      The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes .      I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy .

I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ?      You have to keep things short and sweet .

But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours .      I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ?

I have a few questions about the free membership .      What would you like to know ?      Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ?      Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers .      What are bar vouchers ?      Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees .      But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant .      That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do .      So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ?      Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms .      I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job .

It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation .      But the sale number is close to the predicted amount .      I'm still nervous .

I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .      I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .      If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .      How would you do that ?      I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .      I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .      I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .      The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .      That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . ",

The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !      Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .      This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !      Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander .

Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .

Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too .      Really ? So your city does have some old history after all .

Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year .      Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards .      What are the children doing ?      They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks .      I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year .      Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money .

She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her .      She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English .      Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing .      I think it's a good way to develop our language ability .      Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . ",

I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .      There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?      I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .      Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?      I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .      Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ?

Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . ",

I would love to have someone to help me out , though .      I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great nanny Amy . She used to work for my neighbors , before they moved away . She ’ s very responsible , a good cook , and great with kids .      Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while . ",

Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good .

The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ?

You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .      We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .      That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .      I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo .

I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .      That ’ s good news .

But I'm still paying for it , you know .      I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name .      Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ?      I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans .      I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think .      Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .      Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . ",

There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . .      The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers .      Come on .      Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds .

Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .      But you taught children , yes ?      Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .      They actually study after school ?      That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there .      Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?      Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .      Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that .      So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention .      But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .      As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .      Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ?      That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too .      Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?      I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing .

And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table .      You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .      I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .      You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .      A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .      Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .      I got you . Next time .

I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well .      Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs .

This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !      Do I have to pay an installation fee ?

I know you're right , but what can I do ?      How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ?      But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China .      I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time .      That's a good idea ! ",

I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them .      Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff .      You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ?      You can say that .      But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?      They must have mixed hackers with crackers .      What is crackers then ?      There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them .      So they are two totally different concepts .      Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end .      I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them .      You got it .      Thanks a lot .      You are welcome . ",

It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .      Www , man !      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .      What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?      Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .      Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?      There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .      Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .      I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .      What are your strengths and weaknesses ?      My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .      Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .      I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .      When do you find a job satisfying ?      My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .      How would your coworkers describe you ?      First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .      Do you have any questions ?      Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? ",

Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says .      Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?      There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !      Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?      Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? ",

I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .      Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .      Did she ? That ’ s great .

Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .      Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .

The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself .      That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this .      The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . ",

Easier said than done .      You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her .      But I always get tongue-tied when I see her .      That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased .      I see . I'll try .      Good luck ! ",

We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake .      Right . But people at that time only know two words , \" save \" and \" assistance \" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else .      That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . ",

It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .      Www , man !      In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .      Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?      Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .      And then what happened ?      Well , as we say , the rest is history ... ",

Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry .      Feed them ?      Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts .      And then later everyone eats the food ?      Yes ! How did you guess that ?

Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a \" watch . \"      And the second stage is called a \" tornado warning \" .      Yes .

That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud .      But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?      Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast .      Have you seen a lot of them ?      I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .

They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed .      That's terrible .

Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily .

Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair .
